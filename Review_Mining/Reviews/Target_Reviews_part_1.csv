rating,review
bad,When working with them they make it seem like the best place to work in but it’s not the managers are either lazy or bullying employees they don’t care about their employees safety
bad,"Wish i could rate 0/5. Every few months they roll out a new ""process"" that backfires and requires more man hours. Theyll cut your hours and expect 2x the work from you. You wont be able to zone and stock your section and log your backstock. Once youve failed to do so theyll threaten to fire you and cut your hours even more. Good luck. Dont apply."
bad,I wouldn't apply here they have groups of people that they like and if you're not in their group they make you fill left out.thats why I quit after working their like 5 months
bad,"I chose never to work for this company ever again. Pay is competitive, but the undercurrent culture is to make sure that your contribution to the bottom exceeds everything else."
bad,"never work again "
bad,the managers are rude and dont care and the whole workload was way out of hand for what the pay was. and they made you work excessive hours if you were full time
bad,Worked for this company for many years and I loved the people I worked with but the management was so bad I had to leave. They were very disrespectful and dehumanizing toward there employees and focused too much on the business aspect. This company is going very downhill...
bad,"Ok place to work for but it wasn't for me. I Always thought i could do better. But hey maybe you would like it, who knows... try it. If you're looking for something temp, Target is your place. But if you're looking for long term... than look for somewhere else."
bad,Working and target makes you not want to get out of bed in the morning. They dont care about their employees. They rather you come in sick when you have to handle food then help you get your shift covered
bad,"Supervisors were uncaring to a point and i never truly felt part of a team,  I never had knowledge on how to improve on daily tasks until i was in trouble with the higher ups in the company about job performance."
bad,"Management style at Target is to micromanage, which was not for me. I am not a micromanager nor do I like to be micromanaged. If you thrive in that environment it's a great place. If not, don't bother."
bad,"Too competitive"
bad,"By far one of my biggest mistake was working for this company! It has the most unsafe work environment, no cultural diversity or inclusion! Seriously, if you value yourself and those around you, just find something else, this is the worst work environment."
bad,"Treat you like slaves. They have one person do the jobs of five to cut down on costs while the team members are suffering from all the hard work. Never have I worked for a company where they treat their employees so dirty. Some weeks I don’t even get scheduled and when you bring it up to management they don’t even apologize, they just say there isn’t enough hours for everyone to work. There’s need to be change or else more people are going to quit"
bad,"The store is in constant distress mode. Management is sub-par, and the allocation of hours within the company is atrocious. Workers are compensated poorly even though they are paid $13 an hour+."
bad,"Easily accessible and clean store, unfortunately try to run store with skeleton crews and minimum hours which makes finishing tasks hard or impossible."
bad,"Target would not know good management if it smacked them in the face. The leaders at Target are rude, standoffish, and do not care about any problem you may be facing at work. You do not matter to Target, you are just another disposable worker to them. Working there was the most miserable time of my life. I would continuously have panic attacks in the fitting rooms and on occasion would throw up from the stress of the job in the backroom. Many would say the pay is great, but they do not understand the grueling work that awaits them every shift. If you expect to be praised for your hard work that takes hours upon hours to complete, please look elsewhere."
bad,"I left as soon as I could. I didn't get paid enough. The workers would come in every morning upset at management as they would be late to open the building. I was pushed into working past 30 or 40 hours and wasn't paid for that or overtime. No insurance. It is worth it to mention working part time, you will get full time hours at part time pay. After I left, I had heard that the bowling of product down the aisles was stopped since I had left and that management had been rearranged to fix a lot of issues. Several people were fired only to fix the gap I had left in the company. They had to fix the whole schedule and work routine to replace what was easily done in a shift when I worked there. I occasionally come in and notice that there are employees still stocking the shelves past noon and sometimes later."
bad,"My experience at Target was frustrating and tiring. I previously worked there for about 7 months, left for another job and went back as a second part time job (different location). All they want are people who will always say yes and work 10+ hours. I take pride in my work and love helping out others, whether its my team members or customers, but working there was a literal joke when they don't care about any of their employees. I decided to leave and never come back when they scheduled me on every day OUT OF MY AVAILABILITY and told me ""it's what you signed up for"". I am a 21 year old college student whose had about 6 other jobs and I have never been scheduled ANY day that is out of my availability. Glad I didn't stay even though I desperately needed the money."
bad,"Pay was really bad, I got a 10cent raise my first review and a 15cent the second time. Manager was really bad as well they would blame you for something for another employee left behind."
bad,Management is a joke and nothing more. Hours went from 40 to 4 a week. Couldn’t pay bills & when I asked for more hours to live they told me it wasn’t their problem. I was passed over for a SCO position because of pregnancy. Company is a total joke.
bad,"As time has passed, Target's expectations have worsened to the point of becoming unrealistic and while cutting everyone's hours, so if you should expect to receive 12-16 hours a week, while being scolded for not being able to able to finish all the tasks with thelittle time given. On top of this there's no opportunity of advancement, unfortunately, all management is hired outside the company or transfered from El Paso. Throughout my time here (1 year and 6months) I saw managers come and go, but none of them employees promoted to fill their position."
bad,"They promise that it's possible to move up so long as you show initiative. What they don't tell you is that they really have no interest in moving you up at all. Target has hired MULTIPLE executive team leads as outside hires when there are a plethora of candidates to move up from within the store. Some of the outside hire ETL's are incompetent to say the least. You would honestly have better luck quitting Target, and then applying for the higher position. They make it a point to discourage you from applying for positions within Target. HR makes constant mistakes with the schedule, and our Store Director shouldn't be in charge of an ant farm let alone a store. Hours get cut SIGNIFICANTLY. One week you can have 35 hours and the next can be down to 8. That is dismal when you have full open availability. If you go to HR and tell them that you really need the hours so that you can qualify for insurance, they'll act like they care and promise you that they'll try. You might get decent hours for a little while, but they make sure to cut them down so your average hours worked lowers right before you qualify to sign up for insurance. They don't care about seniority, or how many areas you're trained in. Sometimes they'll schedule a seasonal employee that was previously fired for more hours than somebody that has been there for years (yes, you read that right. They gave a non-existant employee more hours than other team members.) They also promised food for employees every day in the break room. This quickly turned into once a month leaving out ingredients to make a PB&J sandwich, and"
bad,"The lead for the apparel side at my location is rude, unprofessional, and very shallow. Love my coworkers hate the management. A lot of FAVORITISM!!!!"
bad,This Target location was by far the worst. The HR girl is literally a child and doesn’t do anything and the managers do nothing  they don’t even approve days off so they automatically get denied. For your schedule you have to look at the book which is at Target or check Kronos which never seems to work. The lack of communications between ETL and other higher ups are terrible they just send you back and forth to each other
bad,"This places will take advantage of you. When I worked here, they would threaten your job if you are not doing things there way, not to company standard. It is a great starter job, if you only stay there 3-5 months. Anything after that, they start to get very nasty."
bad,Managers all sucked and could do their job for the life of them   Too many clicks with in management  management let their authority take over and never did anything fair
bad,"You are expected to work 10 hours , compensation is poor and there is lack of equal opportunity with growth. They have someone in mind for every position so you do not get a chance to promote unless you have group leadership support."
bad,"Working at the starbucks in target, you got pulled to fill or organize the $1 section A LOT when you weren't scheduled to do that. You also did a lot of the ordering and other managerial tasks that the actual team lead wasn't able to do since they only work at the Starbucks for maybe 8 hours a week; and at that, the 8 hours assigned, the team lead still got pulled outside of the starbucks area. The baristas were awesome, but the management isn't the best."
bad,If you want to be made to feel like you don't matter. Then work at target. They don't care. I didn't get enough hours to feel like I had a job. They schedule a work day with a total of 4 hours a day. Only 2 days a week if you're luck. I loved working. I wanted to keep my job if I could get enough hours to pay any bills any feed my child. My rent it 350. I have one child.  I should have been able to pay these things
bad,Target isn't what it used to be years ago. I used to enjoy coming into work. Now so much has changed and the amount of work they expect for the workers in a specific amount of time is truly unrealistic. A lot of dictating but no help and no one really listens or shows concern to what the employees may express
bad,Target promotes stupid items high dollar stuff people dont buy.i threw thousands of dollars away daily.instead they try to bring different customer in .look at Walmart produce variety for normal people always full look at target empty and dont promote
bad,I don’t feel my managers appreciate me enough. I don’t feel like they work with your scheduale at all. They don’t seem to care about you as a person. Just how good you work
bad,A clique-like high school culture where no one cares about your wellbeing. You want to see all the managers eat lunch at the same time for two hours a day? Then this is the place for you.
bad,There horrible boss the place is always a miss.. pay and hours are horrible.the manger are bad no one listens or care. Hr doesn't know what she doing.
bad,I very much enjoyed the work because I worked both alone as well as with a team of co-workers. It was also interesting working over-nights. The management tended to play favoritism but other than that a good experience.
bad,They were so horrible and fake and condescending towards everyone. The managers need professional training on how to be professional and how to talk to others with respect.
bad,"Much like the flu can do to the body, or, in the case of Target, smallpox, poor management can bring an entire store down. This was the case with the Target that I worked at where the management was unfair. If you were friends with the Store Team Lead (Manager) then you could do no wrong. It didn't matter if you worked a 1/2 hour a day like my direct supervisor did. If you pointed out these issues, you were coached."
bad,"The management doesn't care if you're not physically matched or able to do the position they put you in. You cannot choose, take it or leave it. I am almost 60yrs old and was put in the shipping department during the holidays which was crazy hectic and a safety hazard with piles of merchandise, carts and pallets everywhere. They tell you to go faster and faster and by the time your shift is up your exhausted. I fell as a result of this madness and hurt myself in which management refused to move me to another position within the store or even to help me with my medical bills. I had chiropractic care for months afterwards. Then they let me go and I was coded as DNR."
bad,My experience at this warehouse was disappointing as most of the staff I started with had left or been dismissed in the time I worked there.  The management was not helpful as they did not expect you to stay long
bad,Horrible work environment. Managers talk to people very disrespectfully. Hr does absolutely nothing. There's no training or learning they literally throw you to the wolves
bad,This job is a jokes! You will be push to work harder as much they could push you to get jobs done in few hours as possible or you could get terminated
bad,"Low pay. little hours for work, work like slaves, under a lot of pressure. No sense of being appreciated. Work at an extremely fast pace. Boss talk to you like your not worthy respect."
bad,It's a fortune 500 company. they care about you less than you do about the bugs you step on. If they could cut you out for a profit you'd be gone before you knew what hit you.
bad,I never felt at home here. I was harassed by another grown man employee and they did nothing about it except listen to what I had to say and continued to allow him to work there. They barely give hours and hard work is not appreciated
bad,Management sucks... they do nothing but put you down and expect you to work out miracles. Store leader and chandler and AZ is passive aggressive and often makes people cry. Management talks behind employees backs and is not professional what’s so ever
bad,"Don’t work here, it is one of the most stressful jobs I’ve ever had. You have to run your entire department start to finish and they add more and more to your plate all the time  there’s a reason there’s a huge turnover rate"
bad,"Working at target was great but only with the employees and leads the managers were the worse, disrespectful always wanted to intimidate the employees instead of encouraging them to do better it was always a threat if someone took long in a certain section stocking or doing projects. Employees tried to help and where always friendly but the managers didn’t accept it and were verbally abusive employees and it made it awful to go back to work or even enter work"
bad,"Enjoyed working at Target until my yearly review.  throughout the year, i received nothing but raving reviews from management, which turned over COMPLETELY, in that year. Target corp as a whole had a 10% increase in profit.  they rewarded US with getting to wear jeans, WOW!!!  they rewarded me with $0.13 out of $0.25 raise offer, which I declined."
bad,Not a good work place... The work load they give is to much with little time. Management suck. They are so disrespectful. Not helpful at all. Employee is helpful but they are working under stress
bad,this is the worst job i ever had. worst job ever. horrible company. horrible managerment. very racist. no one cares about your personal life. very rude and does not follow your avalibility. i missed 2 funerals because i was threat to be terminated if i didn't show up to my shift.
bad,"retail jobs have a revolving door system when it comes to employes . there is always someone coming in looking for a job so therefore you are very replaceable, so goes the mamanget culture towards the employe . big on promises low on delivery ."
bad,"Target is a horrible company to work for. I have never worked in such a bad atmosphere. Management was terrible, your just a number, no one cares to help you achieve more."
bad,Upper management didn’t provide the best support or help in all areas of the store. Wanted you to work miracles while they sit in their office and do nothing.
bad,They are very immature for their age and gossip as if they are from Mean Girls. It was a very hostile work environment and very clique oriented so if they didn't like you they made your life awful. Despite whether you did a good job or not. Even the HR lady would tell people your personal business that was supposed to be confidential as HR is supposed to be for employee support.
bad,You didnt have to do very much during a shift at Target. Everyone moves at a snails pace there and it seems to be ok with management. Management walks around only supervising and not helping even the slightest bit.
bad,Never work for this toxic company. They only care about making their corporate higher ups happy instead of their employees. I’ve never worked a worst company.
bad,"Held a seasonal position from October-January, managers were often rude and did not take into consideration the physical limits of some employees. Hours were very unstable and often given last minute with no notices at all. They never answer the phone so many people would be marked for no call no shows when they indeed called. Managers preferred to text employees than call."
bad,"Literally the most depressing job I have ever worked. I have never seen such a level of incompetency and immaturity amongst management in any retail position I’ve worked. Managers are lazy, only jump up and scramble when they hear the district manager is coming around, and even then they don’t do anything except yell at you. Only a couple managers are cool, and they are a very rare breed. They expect you to operate machinery that you need legal certification for, without the licensing. They expect goals that are humanly impossible for one person to complete. The hours are unstable, and the pay isn’t worth the stress. I come home physically and mentally exhausted every shift. I dread every shift knowing I’m going to be insulted, overworked, and condescended by management and nasty guests. Not worth it."
bad,"Target treats their employees like slaves with little to no guidance or direction. After receiving little to no guidance or direction, you get punished for not knowing the proper procedure. If you are ill, it is ""still show up or be considered for termination."". This company is a joke to all of it's customers and employees."
bad,"This place is legal slavery. Target is ran by managers that major in LITERALLY anything and don’t know what they’re doing. You can major in arts and crafts and become a sales lead there. Managers are ignorant, lack common sense, lack empathy, pick and choose who to be mean to and they focus on blame instead of support and solutions when it comes to their team. Their expectations are horrible and make you feel bad for not doing what they want. There is no place for growth, they never schedule enough people to work so they force the whole store to do jobs that are not in their job descriptions. The pay is not even worth it. They underpay their employees. Scheduling is horrible and inconsistent. They do not care about anyone other than their sales. It’s unsafe, full of favoritism and makes their employees depressed."
bad,The team leads were the best but the bosses above them were not. Team leads however had favorites. Even bending over backwards dosent get you anywhere with this job. some of the employees are really rude.
bad,Target has a great workplace culture. They are friendly and the work is the easy. You have great support and structure. I would recommend people to Target.
bad,The location I worked in management was terrible the GSTL's trained the cashiers and on floor team members to do there work for them so they wouldn't have to do a thing. They would schedule me as the only cashier from opening which was 8 AM until 1PM which is when the next cashier came in. I would have a line all the way around because some people were just old school and didn't trust self checkout which I don't blame them for.  Point being NOT a good place to work in.
bad,"The management SUCKS even though u get paid decent you almost never see it because they are constantly cutting your hours. Team members get treated unfairly, managers are bullies and constantly make people cry and or angry. If u can deal with Rude people and they attitudes and headaches this is the place for u."
bad,Ive been working here for over a year and the environment overall is enjoyable. The management doesn't seem to care about employee well being. Some of the management are hostile in the way they demand work and even pick on certain employees.
bad,"They didn't care about letting go anyone. I have a child and bills to pay, but that doesn't matter. I was seasonal, but they let go almost every single person who was seasonal!"
bad,Worst company ever expect more pay employees less.  Stabs in the back for others to get ahead.  You age out once you hit 25 and you become worthless to them.
bad,Unless you’re in management you are treated like a slave and not compensated well ..very undervalued. They also don’t train you to be a leader it is a very bad place to work indeed..they give low hours with no reasoning behind it
bad,It is not a good company to work for if you have a family to feed. O would recommend college students or highschool only. If u not a manager you don't get no hours and if you not on schedule they expect for you to drop what u doing to come in. Then if u don't come in to work they hire new people and give them all the hours and they don't be wanting the hours. Ihacomcomoany
bad,Terrible place to work. No one cares about you at this company. Their main goal is profit and that is it. Spare yourself the misery of working at this h*ll hole.
bad,"Ridiculous atmosphere,  being babysat by kids out of college with no retail experience when I'm middle aged with over 20 years of retail experience but oh no! I don't have a college degree. Reviews based on what they think they saw.  Finally walked out when MGR told me not to answer Red Phone knowing no one was in department. Age Discrimination when you try to move departments."
bad,"There are too many words to even begin with writing this. I have worked for this company for about 3 years and I have worked in every department from front end, electronics, softlines, hardlines, logistics, truck unload, etc. When I started here it was great and the management was very organized and easily approachable. Now, there is absolutely nothing positive I can  say about working for them. They are incredibly rude, unprofessional and disappointing to say at the least."
bad,"I really enjoy talking to the guests and making money at work ."
bad,"Target is great for shopper. No room for advancement, lots of favoritism and shady management practices. Lots of theft within company by employees. Compensation is not great."
bad,"Hard work and dedication goes unnoticed    What’s important ha saying hi to the HR and store director. Nevermind balancing the 25 tasks they pile on you  you don’t have to get much work done as long as you socialize and hang out with your fellow leaders  if you work hard and develop your team, you’re in trouble because you’re not one of the guys. It will break your spirit in half working there if you’re a hard worker"
bad,I work for Target for 6wks and that time I've seen and even had a lot of managers come talk to me about other managers they do not respect no one period. Only customers matters and what they have going on in their lives
bad,Young managers have no idea what it’s like to have family responsibilities outside of work  very young managers right out of college who never had a real full time job treat employees like children and are unrealistic about workload they go straight to management and have no clue what employees have to do
bad,I absolutely hated working there and the leadership was horrible. All they cared about was their employees being at work rather they were feeling good or not. The only thing good about working there is the cafeteria.
bad,"Terrible place to work, their “flexibility” is non existent. The co- workers had nasty attitudes, and the management wasn’t organized. Hated every moment of working here. Work load was also overwhelming."
bad,"This job is the absolute worst, bloodsucking, Soul wasting monster of a job. Say I have been here for 3 years and in that time management does not support us. They claim that they have nohours for there already loyal team but they than will hire 15 other people and give them all the hours. The only good thing I can think of for this company is  that they pay 13 dollars an hour and that in 2020 they are supposedly going   to 15 dollars an hour"
bad,"The job pays well, but it's not worth it because of the wishy-washy management and the low moral. Target frequently asks you to do the work of 3 or 4 people by yourself and is often understaffed. I have 3 managers, Ive talked to two of them once, and I've never seen the other one. I have my managers boss, I've talked to him 2 or 3 times. Im frequently managed by other managers and never know where ill be working. The hours arent flexable, being a student, flexibility is very important. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here. The only slightly good thing ive expierenced in my time here is my other coworkers, all of which strongly dislike working at target and also would not recommend worhere. Calls to HR will often just ring for ages and you won't be able to contact them. I have not enjoymy expirence here"
bad,No sense of security.  Back stabbing. Worse job I have had in 55 years.  Favoritism.  No care attitudes.  There is no meaning of work ethics.Very few individuals can be trusted when it comes to personal matters..
bad,"The $13/$15 an hour is a lure for anyone needing more financial security, only to be under scheduled, overworked, and undervalued. If you're seeking job security with benefits, seek ELSEWHERE."
bad,I began working at Target and it was fine until they began giving the less qualified people more responsibility over those that were qualified. In addition I could never get the days off that I wanted or a set schedule. I wouldn't recommend it for long term employment.
bad,I did not have a very good experience at this job. The workers that were liked got the most hours. The managers were very lazy and would not help you at all. There was a lot of bullying going on from managers and co workers. It is  a very toxic environment.
bad,Don’t work here. I don’t know if it’s just my target but the management is so unorganized and poor. Seasonals and lower end positions get bullied and blamed for issues that are not their fault but because management can’t fix their own problems and have no one else to blame. I have overheard management and higher up positions s*** talk and belittle other coworkers a handful of times which is so unprofessional and sad. They want to make you feel small and useless rather than praise you for your hard work because the truth of the matter is the lower end positions DO THE MOST WORK. Don’t work here if you have any respect for yourself because they will treat you like s*** and make you feel worthless.
bad,The target on 151 is one of the worst work experiences I have ever had they say they have medical and dental but only if you work 40 every week they make sure you don’t reach that they make sure only team leads and the boss or manager get 40 plus hours plus they don’t work with you at all
bad,"THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A CASHIER IT IS NOT WORTH 13/HR you are expected to be a manger."
bad,Target let me go after 17 years of working there. After I hurt my shoulder at Target. The surgery didn't work so the Dr placed me on stationary permenant. And the H.R let me go of my services.
bad,"Management cares more about bottom line then their employees. Don't ever get sick! You'll have your hours cut if you do. Make sure you get promises in writing and signed, otherwise they are useless. May sound like sour grapes but when you experience it, you get jaded from it."
bad,I was fired in my 90 day period because an manger falsely accused me on being on my phone when I wasn’t. Took it to HR and lost my appeal because HR and the mangers are one in the same. Would not recommend this job to anyone because it has a racist atmosphere
bad,"Target in Brier Creek is a terrible place to work, the apparel department new managers are rude and not understanding. It’s holiday season and they only giving out 15-20 hours. They don’t check request time offs. They hire people who don’t have good work ethics. They make the schedule to where you can’t find someone to cover your shift. And they give you a problem if you want to change your availability. Overall a terrible location to work at."
bad,Terrible hours scheduling and bosses no integrity and will terminate you faster then they will hire you.try to get a degree or a trade god bless you throughout your professinal journey
bad,I hate working here they are rude and disrespectful the pay is good but you bust your butt.. Very hard work and you bosy hurt bad people there are not nice
bad,"A typical day is, clocking in, grabbing re-shop, redoing what the closers didn't do, do freight, back up cashier and helping guests. The hardest part of my job is trying to improve the work setting and environment. The most enjoyable parts are helping guests and rebuilding my sales-floor."
bad,Dead end job. Disrespectful of older and experienced workers. Supervisors are insulting and act as if even responsible workers are not doing their job. Stressful end of day when store recovery ( re-set needed to be completed)
bad,Target is not a nice place to work. They don’t pay enough for the unrealistic work load that they put on the employees and are constantly changing policies without thinking of the practicality of them before making all employees follow the new rules.
bad,"A typical day at Target would be me getting with my manager and discussing my daily tasks I was told to complete. The work culture was very toxic for employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of working there were my coworkers. Overall, I’m glad I’m moving on to better things and I’m looking forward to a new chapter in life."
bad,"I started this job because I was in a waiting period for another job. At first it was really nice, I loved my coworkers and it wasn't too bad. Then it started getting to the point where they would never send help to my department so 90% of the time I was solo with maybe one other person. Our manager/supervisor for the portion of the store I worked in was known for yelling at the employees and was a jerk to everyone for no reason. He was borderline harassing us and we tried reporting him multiple times to HR but she never did anything about it. After speaking with other employees about this it seems to have been a regular thing. They try to play it like if there is ever a problem they are there to help you but it's not true. The work loads were ridiculous and the expectations they have set are near impossible to meet. I spoke with many other employees regarding it and they all agreed that it was overboard. I ended up being let go from the job before my ""vacation"" (I was going to a funeral and they knew that but they still called it a vacation.) After being fired I was crying and went to say goodbye to my coworkers. Management hunted me down in the store and kicked me out saying I was ""disrupting the guests and workers."" I was out on the sales floor when this happened, the only ""disturbance"" I may have caused was crying. Months later I found out they fired one of my close friends at the job due to disability. Overall, the only good thing about this job is the store discount."
bad,"""Leads"" were unhappy and spread that to the whole staff. They were upset to see people with potential when they wasted their lives at Target."
bad,"Used to be a company I didn't mind working for. Recently my particular store decided to employ unethical tactics to try to push those with part time availability out of a job. Since they cannot be fired for restricted availability, management has decided to only give them 8 hours of work a week."
bad,One of the absolute worst companies I have ever worked for period. What do expect with your typical big box store like walmart or target? Terrible management that treats employees like dogs and doesn't treat the customers much better. Super low wages even worse than fast food joints lol. And then possibly worst of all is throwing every employee under the bus and limiting hours to 10-15 max per week.
bad,Not a very great place to work.  Never talk of advancement or promotion.  The salary is not great and the health insurance benefits are terrible! Skip it!
bad,"Target acts like its the best place in the world to work. its not. The employees that have been there for awhile, are miserable, give you attitudes, and don't ever want to help you, they treat you like your a burden on them. It's OK for them disrespect you, and be rude. but as soon as you act the same way, you get fired. They don't really train you, or have a training program. you  walk around lost 90% of the time. I highly suggest looking elsewhere for employment."
bad,"they will over work you as much as they can. I've never worked in such an unprofessional petty place in my entire life. Managers can be found sitting in the back all day playing on their phones. Absolutely no team morale. Hours drastically vary, one week you have 39.5, the next week you have 8 hours broken up into 3 days. they will work you 39.5 hours just so you don't count as working full time. Black Friday is crazy hours, workers often sleep in their cars because their shifts are so close together theres no point in going home. not worth the pay or verbal abuse."
bad,"They take advantage of the young inexperienced, the elderly and the mentally challenged workers also the non English speaking. You work under 32 hours per week in order for them not to pay benefits. Your told to collect welfare to subsidize so you can received medical they mainly hire people on welfare so the city pays them $2,500 per"
bad,I was unfaliy let go because i moved to far to go back to work they could have just transferred me to Sacramento not fire me just discrimination against me
bad,Target went from a company for the employees to a company more focused on profits and shareholders.ill be leaving as soon as possible as have many as of late.
bad,"They switched managers often, and each manager had no idea what they were doing. Each left fairly quickly to other jobs, but each made my life miserable, except for one, in their own way. The actual work was fine, but the pay was grueling for how much physical and extra work they demanded. They also merged two jobs so I was getting paid for Flow Team, doing Planogram work, which was supposed to be a raise. I was also given entry level pay, when I had 4 years of experience, and was paid two dollars less than someone who was freshly hired there as his first job. I had to do two jobs, get both done by the end of the work day, and paid for only one job."
bad,"Looked over for advancement due to age and gender. Other team members have come to me and said these things: 1) from what I have seen  they only hire young people, 2) are you sure it isn't due to your age and gender... and many other comments they recogized as I was the right choice for advancement."
bad,Target has poor management employees. They don’t treat you with any respect at all. They have poor training processes and they expect you to know everything when they never even trained you how to do things. When you call out sick they expect you to take some pain killers and still come in. They work you like slaves and treat you like dogs. Each lead for the night have different expectations when they should all have the same expectations and requirements.
bad,This job was and unfit environment. The people who were managing were very disrespectful to people and employees. The company doesn’t really care for the employees.
bad,After working there for over 5 years I'll did love doing what I did for Target. I did meet some amazing and friendly people. but that workplace was a hostile work environment getting too involved in your personal life. It was violent as well.
bad,"people are lazy, team leaders dont care about the employee and working time is inconvenient.people on charge just want to finnish the shift and leave."
bad,The company has taken a turn for the worst. All the management care about is the freight and making team members happy. The Teamleads are treated horribly and are pushed into quitting. If you’re going to school then Target isn’t the place to work. They don’t encourage their team to get an education. They talk negatively about you right in front of your own team members. Target is a toxic work environment and I would not recommend for anyone.
bad,"It is not a work environment for growth,do not know how to run store properly, always come up with new rules that are ridiculous, are rude to employees, say they work with your schedule but still try and make you work on days that you are not available."
bad,"Your higher ups will listen to you, but don't actually care about what you say. They will always talk about you behind their back, even when it involves something they've done wrong. There is no way to move up in the company. Employees have tried multiple times to move up, and every single time they were told they should ""try again next time"" (even though they were fully capable of the job they applied for). They have raised our wage, but the money isn't even worth the amount of work needed to complete. Workers are now responsible for multiple jobs, and I leave feeling that I accomplished nothing. The store is always a mess because no one can keep up with the work put on them. We aren't allowed to help each other out (even though we are a ""team"") because it is seen as ""just talking to each other"". We have to ask a team lead if we can help another coworker out or else we have to get sat down and talked to. Target puts on a front like they are inclusive and fun, but it really isn't. They're going down hill and losing a lot of hardworking employees. Most of the new people they hire quit within two weeks of working."
bad,The work culture was toxic. Everyone was out for themselves. No room for advancing. The boss played favorites. Had to work on holidays and could not request ANY time off from November through January. No recognition. Target was bringing out the worst in me because I was surrounded by unhappy peers. The team members keep getting raises while the team leads would stay the same
bad,"This review is for the Bangor, ME location.  I worked at another Target and it was pretty OK.  Bangor is terribly managed.  No hours unless you are some supervisor's pet.  Go into the store and see for yourself.  Pallets left everywhere on the sales floor all day.  Everything is messy.  Nothing gets recovered. Easily the most screwed up place I ever worked."
bad,"I was hired for a seasonal job about 2 1/2 weeks ago.  About a week later, there was a brief orientation, yet nobody knew what my schedule would be after that.  I had to call several times until I was finally able to reach someone and find out that I was scheduled for two 4 hour shifts for my first week.   Not what I expected, but they assured me that it was just the training schedule and I'd get more hours afterwards.   I came in on time and did everything I was asked to do.   When I asked for my next week's schedule prior to leaving, nobody had an answer.  I was told that a manager would contact me about it the next day, but he never did.  Then I called the store myself and the person in HR just said something like 'just be patient, you'll be scheduled when the hiring manager gets everything in order'.  This advice is a waste of time.  They are supposed to have everything in order when they offer you a job.  They are supposed to have the hours to give you when they hire you and not expect you to be on call in case they need you.  They are not supposed to give people the false impression that they're hired for a job when there aren't any hours.  I've had a couple of seasonal jobs in my life, and both times I was actually scheduled to come in and work consistently from the time I was hired  until the holiday season ended.  Newsflash to Target management - when people apply for a job, they're not doing it for their health.  They probably need the money and it's wrong to waste their time and give them the runaround this way.  Incidentally, everything from the interview to the"
bad,"Don't apply. Look somewhere else."
bad,"lots of young adults are hired as team leads, thus not having suffice managerial experience, which can develop into no people skills. Management is not on top of providing quality work culture."
bad,People are mean and management doesn't care.   They would have you close one night and open the next day.  One week you would have 40 hours and the next 10.  So may was it sucked.
bad,"Unfortunately this review is simply 100% HONEST, therefore it will not have a lot of positive remarks of this company. "
bad,"Target North in Apple Valley, MN is a terrible company to work for. The flex team manager is one of the worst managers ever. She is verbally abusive and extremely rude. Also, the director of the store promotes not properly training their employees. It is the worst most inconsiderate management. Customers have no clue what is going on behind the scenes in the flex department. Terrible management."
bad,You will constantly have a mutual misunderstanding with the non-competent leaders who are above you.  You will see and hear things that have no meaning or value.
bad,"management doesn't care, always changing LOD's, write ups for reasons they make up, always pushing red card sales, if you don't get enough red card sales you get a ""talk too"" favoritism big time. Not worth working for, alright if you only plan on staying for seasonal."
bad,"It started out fun, not gonna lie. I enjoyed putting things in order, I was usually left alone when given a task, and things were great. Then I was given an opportunity to advance. I completed the interview process and was put on the ""bench"", basically ready to get promoted. Then supervisors started not working, spending time on phones, blaming others for tasks not getting done and never taking responsibility. People were hired and fired like hotcakes and it got overall stressful. I ended up not ever getting a true promotion after 6 months of waiting, and ended up getting treated like garbage just because I cared about the store and my job when nearly every supervisor didn't care one bit. Don't work retail people."
bad,Management are in own click   Slams door in your face no time for any issues that might arise   Upper management is really bad   Don’t care for the employees  have seen people their for 30 years forced to leave   Bad company
bad,They got angry because I told them I had another job when I first was hired. They expected people to live off 3 days a week. The managers were horrible. We were getting paid less to do more. Been there for 3years till I called it quits
bad,Stressful environment. No real direction and no manager knows what's going on. Was told something different all the time by every manager. Not willing to work with their employees at all.
bad,"I would not recommend working at Target. More specifically the location I worked. The management is ABSOLUTELY terrible. Very disrespectful. Nothing is ever good enough for them, even if you do it EXACTLY HOW THEY ASKED!"
bad,This company y is terrible! No hours and horrible management! No one ever knows what to do! Our ETL and LOD were clueless! They busted walked around the store and chatted
bad,I quit for a reason. I guess it always depends where you work. Try to cross train because then you’re not always stuck in the same spot I guess. HVe fun
bad,Management is horrible. They have no care for school or outside life emergencies. They do not work with people on their flexibility changes when needed for school.
bad,Working for target is one of the worst experiences I’ve had it’s only second to my third job. My location was a total mess. Anyone who cared for their job was always on edge.
bad,"Overall I had a pretty bad work environment, due to poor management, and awful scheduling for employees. There were two good managers the HR and Store manager, and only one good floor manager. You're very much forced to encourage to sway customers who clearly don't want red cards to constantly poke them. Even if it ruins the customers experience you will be talked to about how you always need to pressure more people into opening accounts even if its against their own interest."
bad,"The company started switching the mode operation on a daily basis. No consistency, and if you a day off, you had to ask the other staff members what had changed since were at the job. This company has derailed drastically."
bad,"My Store team lead and team lead for market were very bad excuses for leaders. Its sad when you know more and can do more than your own team lead and they talk to you like they know everything when you've been there for 3+ years and know that store better than they ever will. In market we were expected to about 10 hours of work in usually a 7 hour or less shift sometimes 4 with no help from our team lead, Store team lead, or other departments. Our team lead would spend his whole 8 hour shift walking around doing signing and messing around with vendor product instead of helping his team. Then we would get in trouble when the work didn't get finished but yet no one was there to help us do it. If you did something wrong one time or didn't finish your work then your looked at like a bad worker. The environment is stressful and not worth it when your just looked at like someone who can be replaced, and when your not even cared for as a human. All those people care about is that the work gets done so all the leaders/Store team lead can look good to the upper management. That's the only time they would care to help with anything is when they knew we were getting a walk. I would not recommend working here for anyone, your treated like nothing and like you don't matter.Its all about pleasing someone else in the target world.And I tried to get the problems fixed many many many times and nothing changed and still hasn't since me and a couple other people found better jobs and left."
bad,"Target sucks as a company to work for, do not work there. They don’t care about you or your well being, it’s a selfish company. Not worth the headache and hardship."
bad,"There is no liability for there employees. As a asset protection specialist you have a duty to conduct investigations on theft and also have the ability to apprehend a shoplifter. But when you run into a same incident like I did, where I apprehended a subject for concealing items then learning in the process the the subject was ticket switching price tags. I was termed for defending myself from this subject."
bad,Put simply the management is absolutely atrocious. Even when the higher-ups do illegal and shady stuff it is completely passed over by corporate. so many people like to think that Target traits and pays their employees better than Walmart but that is absolutely not true. They are exactly the same to their employees. said it before and I'll say it again Target is the worst place I have ever worked and I worked at McDonald's.
bad,"The management approaches you every 10 minutes yelling at you and telling you that your doing things wrong when your doing them as taught, the lighting there is so bright you get headaches"
bad,There see limited opportunities for promotions.  The store is poorly stocked & their management is poorly trained.  Would not recommend this employer to anyone.
bad,assisting customers by checking them out and helping with questions they may have..helping them find items n the store.. also counting down drawers..was a pleasant place.
bad,"You are just a number and not a name. Don't plan to have a family life. You are working 65+ hours for 8 months out of the year.  You are worked to death and then some.  If you call off because you just need a day of rest, you are given no grace. "
bad,"This is one of the worse places to work especially for someone new to and area, i was fired for a no call no show when my shift was scheduled for 430 am i got into a wreck on my way there and I couldn't get in contact with any staff because , i made it to work that day and the following day worked a full shift to be fired at the end of the shift . WORST JOB EVER"
bad,"I worked for the Pleasant Hill California store for a few weeks and had an absolutely terrible experience.   It took over three weeks for a background check due to an error on their part.   When I finally got there they tried to train me  for twenty minutes on the register and then leave me on my own.    That would not work. I need proper training.  They admitted they through me under the bus.  There words not mine. "
bad,It's retail and it's awful. Some of the co-workers were lovely understanding people. Management never was. I also had a team of upper management and each person in a day would have me do something else even if it wasn't in my area. Stay away unless you can handle retail environments with managers who watch you like a hawk at all times.
bad,Very unprofessional . Zero accountability.  Wrongful accusations led to dismissal.  Non compliance to policy and procedure. Bias investigations.  Low morale.
bad,Target is more focused on their bottom line than on their team members. It is nearly impossible to move up into management unless you are favored by someone that is already in upper management. It doesn't matter if you work hard and do everything correctly. You'll never succeed because they will knock you down every chance they get.
bad,"This company sucks as a whole organization. They literally only care about themselves and no one else, only managers get treated fairly. The managers have no good sense of judgement and no plain common sense at all. Please do not apply because you will regret your decision."
bad,"working seasonal, they will most likely always take advantage of you as an employee. asking you to stay late is the regular and it would make you wonder if they're short staffed. surely not a place like target."
bad,"The #1 thing to target management, is functioning of the store. Not it’s loyal team members, no compassion for others, just concerned about the bottom line"
bad,The “leads” pick their favorites and if you’re not a favorite you get treated like absolute garbage. Also the leads like to have personal issues with you and let it affect how they treat and talk about you in the work place. 10/10 do not recommend working here. Everyone just sits around and gossips like it’s highschool. HR has literally gossiped about guests to me. How sad is that? It’s truly disgusting and I don’t recommend working here.
bad,Horrible communication and a terrible work environment. Working for corporations is all about money and not a single bit about the workers. There isn't any compensation or progress here.
bad,Management and the corporation are a joke they don't know what there doing but I still like to work there because they provide me with a good laugh  target is the biggest joke and stupidest
bad,"The Avon, Indiana Super Target is NOT a place to work. Before all the new managers I would’ve said it was a good place to start at but Management is rude and disrespectful to their employees and will do everything in their power to either make you quit or to fire you. When employees aren’t around they will talk down about all of us and will surely do the same to you. An employee I know gets called in their office almost every Friday they give that person a coaching for the dumbest reasons like “you didn’t ask for help even though we had two visits going on at the time.” Literally cannot make this stuff up. They promote a positive and fun environment but in reality it’s more like a prison. This Target specifically has lost more customers and employees than they’ve gained. Adding to that, they hire a bunch of people and never have them working. So for cashiers they’ll only have two or three Check out lanes open and have lines everywhere including self checkout. It’s almost a waste of time being hired when you’re not given hours. Before everything changed I would get nice hours but then I would only work one four hour shift one week and then not at all the next. Extremely hard to make a living off of an $80 something paycheck. I decided to leave when they tried to make work more important than my educations even though I barely received hours.  Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this toxic, miserable place as possible especially those that are in school."
bad,"I worked at Target briefly. It was the single worst experience of my life. I was given next to no training and sent off on my own. I had no idea what I was doing and ended up having debilitating panic attacks, partially because management was entirely unhelpful and partially because of how awful the customers were. I tried to transfer to another position and wasn't allowed to. On top of all of that, my hours were wildly inconsistent and entirely ignored my availability. The pay was low to typical, but the workload was very heavy. I'm lucky that I wasn't trying to survive off of it, but it would have been literally impossible to do so."
bad,"It has been said that this is a job that you can advance in but truth be told, they would rather hire someone outside the company before someone who knows the company."
bad,"No training, asking managers for help is like insulting them. My department was often behind because I was constantly taken out to help out other departments. I saw other employees before me get fired for ""time theft"" when in reality the lack of training just forced them to pretend to look busy to not get scolded. Haven't met a single person that actually enjoys working there, there is a general agreement that the only two things that make the job bearable is need for money and coworkers are nice. Other than that, I have never been so unmotivated to make money in my life."
bad,This company does not care about its team members. Target has a very poor track record of terrible management. And they continue to hire people with no experience. Which affects the workers and the store representation. Over all this company is not worth h your time. The starting pay may seem nice but in the long run they will work you to death and not think twice about firing you. I worked for them for 5 years just don’t do it.
bad,"Target will only work you about 10-15 hours a week. They routinely will schedule you with no hours for an entire week. They don't train you, and in my personal experience at my particular store, the other employees seem racist. Leaders play favorites, and if you have an issue you would like to report to HR, be prepared to be fired over it. "
bad,"I enjoyed the Holidays their, but was treated very  poorly at end of my second  year of employment! They terminated me for talking to a team member and voiceing my opinion on a child abandonment issue when a customer complained!"
bad,"assisting customers with products."
bad,"Seriously felt like death every day  management was horrible and negative and very very rude, impossible to move up, but used as an empty promise to stay with the company"
bad,No inclusivity.make life really hard for their employees.not a place I would reccomend. They dont follow your availability if you have a life out side of target.if you dont have a life outside of target they dont give enough hours to live on.the management dont care about the hourly workers at all.the hourly supervisors dont help and aren't very nice.
bad,"I was promised at 30-40 hours a week when I started. They gave me 15-20 for the first month. Then 25 up until now. I was fired this morning because they said that I no call no showed yesterday, which is not true at all. I even told them to speak to the manager I called off to, and that I would show them my phone records. The HR lady screamed at me to exit the property, not allowing me to speak. I then left and called to speak to Peter (the highest manager at the store. I explained to him what happened, and he told me he would talk to the manager that I called off to, but that the termination was already final. I told them when I was hired I need Thursdays off. They have NEVER given me a Thursday off and I come in anyways. They did not approve me for my request to have my birthday off. And now I am fired for something that I did not do, and they know I did not do it yet say it is too late. DO NOT WORK HERE, WORST MANAGEMENT I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"With 3 decades of work experience behind me, I applied to a seasonal job in the Easton store to supplement my income so I could pay my health insurance and keep a roof over my head. Sadly, within 24 hours of submitting the application, I received a bittersweet ""no thank you, we found someone more qualified"" email, yet they continue to post the same job ads over and over.  I guess whatever 18 year old they have hired to screen these applications felt threatened and insecure."
bad,Sometimes jobs make changes for better. Some changes have been made and it wasnt the best choice. Then emplyees are talked down to like eveybody is a child. Dont get sick they get mad at that. They dont care about their emplyeea well being at all.
bad,"Just horrible. Worked in retail for 9 straight years and never experienced anything like the trash at target. Underpaid, overworked and your value is overlooked by monetary gain. They can afford to pay they're employees 18$p/h w/o losing any revenue. Why so greedy target."
bad,"They need to re-establish their training efforts. When new products were sold in the department, there was no information or training regarding the new products. If we wanted to know any information, it was our responsibility to look up product knowledge and learn it to pass on to the customers interested in purchasing that particular product or products"
bad,I didn't like it. It was the worse time of the year. Management where very bad the schedule was all over the place. They where nont flexible like they said in the interview
bad,"Most definetly poor and not the same Working Environment over a decade when I first start working for Target in December 2004;"
bad,"They tell you how great it is here ,but after you STRAT working they will work you till you can’t move ,they mandate over time and nights .this is the worse place I’ve ever worked for. Do not apply !!!"
bad,Is not the place if you want to prosper. I recommend students straight from high school should work there as a little job. But if your looking for a long term thing.
bad,Target isn’t as nice as it seems nor do they care about employees. Management is horrible and there’s no structure. Lowest store in the area and lowest morale I have ever seen
bad,"I started out liking this job, but then people started quitting and my responsibilities have become unrealistic! It's been 3 months for me and I'm already looking for something more conducive for me. The management is terrible,  noone listens or tries to help you, the hours are scarce and I'm not happy here"
bad,"Management was rude and overbearing, wanted to much than was possible and tried to force people to take demotions, to hire new people. Didn't care if you were sick or not. Written up for nothing."
bad,"The rules and methods are always changing, and management doesn't truly believe in any of it. it makes it hard to get clarification on lots of the rules and guidelines when management doesn't listen to the actual handbook."
bad,"I worked for target for 3 months, in that entire span I knew not a single persons name or even the managers names! No one was friendly, I could take an hour long break and no one even noticed. I came upon some health problems and I asked if I could be taken off of carts and was told that target requires all team members to be able to do every position. I was thrown into roles that I was never trained for and expected to work them, had crazy different hours having me close one day and open the next. Even the discount from target are not even worth it. You can't use a debit card with your discount you have to use cash or a red card! I felt very unappreciated and unnoticed. Don't work here, they expect you to give up your whole life for them."
bad,Worked there for over a year. Your not cared about and pay is terrible so are hours. They take advantage of the employees. Your verbally abused for calling out and there's extreme favoritism no promotion options.
bad,"Target is like chronic constipation. "
bad,"As i take full responsibility for not paying attention. The HR admin and mgt. purposely screwed up my E-verify. Causing me to get flagged and then termed. Appearing to feel remorse about their mistake with huge liability. They rehired me as if they were doing me some kind of Favor! Only to have replaced me during my absence with a more comfortable ""looking"" waste of space associate. How does one survive on $11.00, 12 hours a week? Open availability is a joke. These people at this location are heartless, ignorant, vile, and pathetic. I hope that none of these so called managers never face anything that removes them from their comfort zones, because they surely will fail."
bad,"This is by far the worst job I've ever had. Everyone, customers and coworkers, treat you like you're no one. There is little understanding and they are very quick to discipline."
bad,Terrible company to work for they don’t care about there employees I worked there for 6 years they Don’t communicate with the team members or the team leads
bad,Target doesn’t listen to anything you have to say that involves another team lead at all. All issues you come to with them they will say they will address it but won’t take action and fix it.
bad,Was let go because of 1 excused absence and was five minutes late twice. Every weekend there’d be at least one pallet of cat food that would have some damaged cans and cause an infestation of maggots. They stored the cat food in the same section as the human food. Normally it’d be on the highest section and their maggot clean up consisted of getting the damage cans and tossing them out. They mad no effort to inspect surround food for possible contamination.
bad,Stay as far away as possible. The make you do the work of 5 people with a short staff. Do not work here. Management sucks. The don't care about their team.
bad,The hours are always terrible. Management loves to run in a skeleton crew. They will tell you that you aren’t working hard enough or fast enough even if you are the only team member working in 4 different departments. Management doesn’t plan ahead in the event of call outs or terminations. They don’t properly cross train you and just throw you into another department and say “good luck.” Benefits range from terrible to nonexistent. They also expect you to do the work of a team lead without paying as if you are a team lead.
bad,I prefer not to speak to my experience with Target. I would say is to do your research on the store culture and employee environment. Ask the important questions around time line and expectations.
bad,I'm a diabetic and I would have mornings where I would have a high blood sugar and would be throwing up in the restroom. The management team wouldn't care and putting me back to work disregarding my condition.
bad,Myself and six other co-workers over age 35 were Forced out by giving worst schedule and tasks physical challenging with no support and high repercussion without regard for experience.
bad,If I could give this company no stars it would be more fitting. The East Piint location especially has poor management. The pay rate is low considering the job they want done. They constantly cut hours for the people that actually work and give the least qualified people hours based off likeability and who they fabor or have relations with.
bad,Target Canoga Park needs better management. One manager with tattoos and short hair had a really mean attitude.  She rarely smiles and needs better customer service skills.  Management needs to be more respectful of their employees. I resigned due to the rudeness.
bad,Management favors certain employees and store manager is unapproachable and very rude and two faced.  Never would recommend this Target for work! They expect way to much for one person to get done.
bad,Working at target is very stressful and employers treat you however they want because of the pay. They are rude and disrespectful and have you doing stuff that isn't your job and they take out there stress and anger out on you all the time.
bad,Lufkin target is the worst target imaginable. Avoid at all costs until management and the toxic environment is gone. The 15$/HR they offer doesn't make it worth working in a favoritism environment where if your Gay/Lesbian you get a upper hand in playing teachers pet.
bad,"I have never been treated so horribly in my working career by management. They do not care whatsoever about their employees, they hand you a large work load without ample time to complete the tasks. I received about 19-25 hours a week, even with making 13 dollars an hour that is not enough to live off of."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work their the company promotions are base off of who they like and not who work hard the expectations are to high. They want you to do a lot of work no coverage on the floor  they dnt give hours out 2 or 3 days that add up to 21 hours a day how can you survive off of that the company is not for grownup. They dont care about your wellbeing as long as their work get done for
bad,"Management consists of low quality and inexperienced people over seasoned employees.  Once you hit an age over 50, Target actively seeks to find ways to terminate or force employees out.  Despicable behavior from a huge corporation."
bad,I hate target! They are racist and did nothing g about my situation when a racist man came in and said horrible things to me about the color of my skin
bad,I was not happy there the pay was low to be doing all the work we had to do and the high up was not any hill when to tryed to talk with them I never work with them again
bad,"Part time Toys GM here. I was told that my schedule would not work with Target even after discussing this upon hiring due to attending college part time. Target gave me the ultimatum to change my schedule or be terminated. I quit on the spot out, feeling absolutely betrayed by the company and hurt financially. I would not work here unless you want to work at Target as a literal career. Workplace culture was toxic, basically revolved around corporate numbers. HR is just a glorified manager, will not help with actual HR cases and tell you to call their integrity hotline. I wouldn't recommend Target to anyone."
bad,No hours at Target they treat there employee's like trash I gave my two week notice and they didn't take it mail me a letter saying I was fired I always give a two week notice I left because there was no hours
bad,We're not recommend target to anyone to work Terrible management Pay raises are 7 cents annually a very hostile work environment They advertise well but what happens behind closed doors just not good
bad,"It's not the coworkers or the immediate managers, but the overall suffocating atmosphere of target that causes major suicidality in its employees. You really lose your soul a little more each shift."
bad,Terrible management. Always on my butt they lie to you saying what your job is especially picking but wont allow you to pick until you've successfully been able to be a fast feeder and they claim that you're only supposed to work 2 lines as a new hire they always give you 4 lines and always place new hires with fastest packers and it's an automatic failure
bad,"They will get you in, promise you lots of hours..you will, at first get hours, and then..poof..no hours, they will set expectations way to high and unrealistic....I get no benfits, or vacation time,due to lack of hours available to me.training,..forget it..maybe a day..then ur on your own.This  has by far been the worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,"Not a good place to work if you need money or living expenses covered by salary. Management doesn’t care about workers health or time, will schedule randomly and inconsistently based around their time, not the workers. Management would spend most time sitting, walking and talking to each other rather than managing the employees or their areas."
bad,"Do not apply, management has unrealistic goals and cuts hours even if you somehow manage to make their requests. Hours are incredibly bad unless you’re higher up, good for a high schooler or maybe someone who’s retired."
bad,"I could write a book on how terrible this place is. How terrible it treats its workers, managers, and products. They promised me a role as a team lead, and started training me for it, FOR FOUR MONTHS, then they gave the job to my ""buddy"" who i definitely thought deserved it. they then proceeded to tell me i was to young for the job without providing a plausible reason. That is only one story."
bad,"dont even bother applying unless your a robot"
bad,Favoritism. Inappropriate conduct. Disrespectful supervisors. Poor leadership. Micromanagement. Schedule is never the same unless you're upper echelon. Decade commuted employees underpaid and unpromotable. Uncomfortable attire. Poor raises for the actual workers. Immature leadership. Vindictive leadership. Red card customers do not receive the discount promised.
bad,"After a very promising interview, I was completely disappointed by my first day when I was told to show up at 9 but when I did they told me I was supposed to be there at 8 and they were already processing my termination papers. From there on it was nothing but lies about the amount of hours I would receive. Most of the staff was disgruntled and it was not a positive environment."
bad,They cut your hours. Managers get alway with everything. Managers lazy. No one wants to work. They also don’t make you punch for breaks and it’s so abused at the store I worked at. There was different rules for different people.
bad,"I worked there for 3 months and was always told I was doing a good job. The pay was good but the hours were not. I was barely getting 20 hours a week even when asked for more hours. The manager made women feel like they can't do anything because they were women. If he does not like you, he will find any reason to let you go even if its an unfair reason. WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO WORK AT A PLACE LIKE THIS. The ones in charge let their power get to their heads."
bad,The most stressful thing ever. Be prepared to do everyone’s jobs while your managers walk around and complain. You don’t get paid enough for what all this little job title consists of
bad,I do not recommend working here unless you like being treated like a pack mule. They do not treat you fairly and expect insane amount of work to be done in a short period of time. They will coach you on something that everyone else does but if they dislike you then you will know because your treated unfairly. HR does not handle certain situations correctly nor do they speak to you as a human but as a thing. Do not work here unless you want all that.
bad,"typical day restocking shelves, helping customers. target is the only job id never work for ever again. never felt comfortable with the team. i wouldnt say all target you would have a bad experience with, i know others who felt the same that worked at this location"
bad,Management was poor and inconsistent with their policies.  The management also did not back up the cashiers when problems arose.  There was also favoritism among the employees.
bad,The company is run horribly. The hours system is poorly managed. The management preaches about being a team but you never feel like they actually care about you. My hours were constantly scheduled on times where I specifically noted that I was unavailable. Would not recommend working here ever.
bad,"Negatives: Management awful! Workplace culture is awful! I was extremely excited to start working there when I did, and that excitement quickly dwindled. They know they are paying you well and they use that to their advantage and treat their employees unfairly. They will not stick to your scheduling requests and will sometimes even schedule you out of your availability and get upset when you have to call-out because you physically can not come to work. Team members have been yelled at on the floor for simply stopping by a fellow team member to ask a quick question, people have been fired simply because one specific manager did not agree with them. People come and go so frequently, it's almost like clockwork. People are fired left and right for minimal things, and then everyone else's schedule suffers as a result as the hiring rate continues to decrease. I have watched incredibly talented and valuable team members be fired because one particular manager did not agree with them or because she pushed them so much by being rude, condescending, and not adhering to their availability that they had no choice but to leave. We feel as though we are constantly being watched by management and people are consistently called out for making the smallest mistake although they are amazing employees. The pay is enticing, I know, but be warned that working here will ruin this company for you. "
bad,They don't know how to take accountability for their work or their team. Needs improvement badly. The actual workers or department heads are not that bad but they are not all there for top management
bad,"If you don't mind being yelled at by customers, or cleaning up the mess of your fellow lazy co-workers then this is the job for you. Long hours with no appreciation or opportunities to move up in the company if you are not a favorite. Or the fact that employees get better chances if you sleep with the higher ups. this place is a mess"
bad,"Target is the worst place they are bias and very racist. All the executives are sleeping with Team members. Team leads sleeping with executives. Corporate knows about it and not doing anything just firing the people whose been there a while to hire new people and pay them less. Wrongful termination, they are very petty not a real business. They are shady and unprofessional."
bad,Target was a very unhappy place to work at. There was too much tension and drama between members. The discount that is offered to members is worthless
bad,"Target is a massive corporation that values profit and advertising over employee health and welfare. Expect to have more than anyone could handle put on your plate, and then be put on a professional improvement plan by a manager that has probably never done your job. Your co-workers will, for the most part, be great. However, they hire in mass, and let go in mass, so its dog-eat-dog. Too much changes week after week, and its constantly done with less payroll and more expected of each person. You'll be tired, angry, burnt out, and never see your family, ESPECIALLY if you're salaried. Hourly sucks just as much because you are never authorized overtime. Good luck, don't say I didn't warn you."
bad,"Not flexible and takes advantage of open availability. Inconsistent scheduling, one week will be a lot of hours for 6-7 days back to back and then 25."
bad,You cannot trust management or HR. They are sexist and unprofessional. They continue to promise the team certain things yet they never seem to keep their word.
bad,I would only recommend Target if you have no other options. The store I worked for was not concerned with retention. Employee call outs were not replaced so always short staffed.
bad,"New Modernization program is not working and target fails to realize this. They cut hours every other day except for certain employees, they try to bully us to do 10 hours of work in four hours, we have groceries sitting in carts everywhere cause we’re getting a food truck everyday that we don’t need and the guests are going to Walmart cause our shelves are not filled. It’s a mess i.most"
bad,don't waste your time they treat team members like garbge they don't care about you or your life. they just want to pay you as little as possible to do as much work as possible. And if you go out on medical leave for your mental health the HR manger will tell you that you need to earn respect back for being gone.
bad,working there started all Good but fell apart year 2. On holidays they cut hours. Then they started cutting hours period. A big turn off for me so i left.
bad,If I could put zero stars I would! Love my fellow co workers but management is the WORST! Target is supposed to be based on equality and family and that is a lie!
bad,"I promise you, the $13 an hour is not worth how horrible the management is. I'm not one to complain, and I'm complaining about them. The management is selfish, inconsiderate, childish, and ""gossipy""."
bad,"They will boss you, treat you like you don't matter. I don't know about others, but my overall experience at Target wasn't good. The bosses were mean, micro managers"
bad,"Terrible place to work! They expect you to cashier, help guest, stock shelf’s, do online orders, pull batches and backstock all in 3 hours & pay less then minimum wage. Don’t recommend you’re better off at McDonald’s."
bad,Target is a well maintained business. The have almost everything you would go to look for and more. You can never just come in and buy one item. Your leaving with two carts or better.
bad,"I cannot!!! This place just not cool. I stayed before I got pregnant when I was pregnant and the kicker was when I gave birth. I was constantly getting calls to come back shortly after I gave birth. I know there’s no paid leave which was bad enough, but rushing me to come back to the same minimum wage?! Absolutely not! After a year with them I received an .08 cent raise."
bad,"Horrible company to work for with such unrealistic expectations!!! Store Director abd ETLs micromanage everything and HR doesn’t care about team members. I thought this would be a great company to work for after I had my interview and It ended up being a DISASTER. Minimal payroll allotted to run front end, but still expected to work miracles. You call for help for front end no one responds!!!"
bad,"The management treats you like you are dispensable and they are really good at looking like they're doing a lot while you do their actual job. Please don't work here it is not worth the pay, you won't be able to see your family for holidays and you will dread going to work. Avoid at all costs"
bad,"I was employed by Target for 16 years in a leadership role. I enjoyed working there for 15 of those years. In year 16, Target  began a modernization process. They raised the starting rate and cut hours. In my store they began to get rid of older people in leadership roles and replaced them with younger people. If you were there for years, making a little bit of money, and were older, they got rid of you. Upper management  had zero integrity. None. They don't care about you or your family. It became ""All About Target"""
bad,"Customers complain all the time about shelves being empty,  about not enough cashiers,  there is no communication  between shift leads and guest advocates.  If you don't take your 30 min break when your supposed to you have to sign a compliance form.  You wait for someone to let you in equipment room.  If your sick and have doctors note they say your faking it.  Worst place to work.  Have had passed employees say the same thing that its the worst job out there."
bad,"These people don’t care about you! If you are sick and try to call in, they won’t schedule you for two weeks! They cut hours as well when business is slow. They expect you to do 10 "
bad,"As someone who worked at Target for 12 years as the culture changed within the company it became painful to come to work everyday.  You as a worker disposable to management, and workers are overworked and under compensated for the effort and and talents that they put forward.  Horrible to have 19-20 hours a week to do 40 hours a week of work!!!"
bad,The company has gone though so many changes in order to keep up with online realtors in a bad way for those looking for long time employment.  If you are looking for benefits the company is good but the management will sooner or later look into replacing you with cheaper less experienced workers by giving you the task of five employees and every other employees will be given.less with more pay
bad,"Management is very centered.  Cut employee hours, but hire more people. Management always has 40 hours bit will cut employees to 20. Unreliable schedule. Long term employees are lazy and receive all credit. Horrible pay, no chance for advancement unless there 20yrs. Good for part time work if you do not count on it for soul income. Other than that not worth it.  They will work you to the bone bit if you call off give you 5 hours in one week."
bad,"Target is, by far, the worst job I've ever had. Management is out of control. Corporate is supposed to rotate them around but when they don't, management gets comfortable treating employees terribly because there is no consequence. Gossip is rampant, and the only thing worse than the gossip is the favoritism. On the upside, if you're willing to brown nose, you will be promoted. And protected. Different rules apply to their favorites. Also, with the decent pay, you get less hours and are expected to do the work of 3 people. Don't work here, it's not worth it."
bad,Management was too young and inexperienced for their position. Problem solving was nonexistent and employees are treated as numbers only. The Red Card is the primary concern and you are pushed to sell it to all customers. Very unfair treatment of cashiers.
bad,Target did not stick to what they said during orientation they do not give reasonable hours if anything the hours they give is a waste of time and they still keep hiring people tho they have no hours to give the store manager doesn't care about anything except for her own pay check and will say you are in the wrong if you report harassment or any kind of malpractice really it's all around a terible place to work
bad,"The Team Leads, Managers and leaders on site are the worst. They don’t really enjoy communication and they don’t value you at all. Leaders tend to tell you to “work faster” all the time even though you are. They don’t really enjoy call offs and will ask you why you want to call of even if you rarely do. They will also say when you call off “this will be recorded and affect on your attendance.” Do not work here.  The departments are all a mess and you will always work on your own in a very stressful environments. Now that target corporate is changing everything it is not a good job for anyone they do not pay you enough for how you are treated or what you are doing. It’s great to shop there. But I would never recommend working there ever!"
bad,"Target's ""so called"" leadership promotes, encourages, and condones a culture of unethical, immoral, and disingenuous behavior. "
bad,Germantown target is a terrible place to work for. Avoid at all costs. Overworked and underpaid. Your hard work will NOT be rewarded or acknowledged. The manager believes that everyone is replaceable and will force you to overwork or quit.
bad,"Management is very lacking. The softlines TL is the worse of the group. Turn over is hitting a all time high and the hr does nothing to help look into just why this is. Very unsafe practices are being followed to get the massive amount of work that is required in a short time period.  Don't let the money fool you. The bullying and stress are just not worth it."
bad,Management had not trust in employee and was always micro managing us and had a very bad people skills and was rude and disrespectful to employees !!!!!
bad,"Working at Target was okay, the vibe was fine, the coworkers were fine, i guess i just didn’t like working in retail and checking people out and bagging groceries all day"
bad,Unless management you do not receive benefits and hours are slim.  Not respected experience or loyalty. Getting rid of long time workers.  As long as you have a college degree no matter what field you can become a executive.  Management has favoritisms fir some
bad,"Too stressful, do more work than we’re paid for, not enough praise, no hours, no respect ................... do not work here, they have a lot of soul searching to do"
bad,Target expect u to be a robot I use to get off at 10:30 sometimes 11 and they expect u back for morning shift. I don’t think all mangers treat their team this way but the the location 6295 waters ave was treats ppl like garbage
bad,"Target is not a good place to work"
bad,They don't really care about the guest. The management is to worried about goal and putting bonuses in he or she pockets. They rarely give you hours at most 10 a week. I don't encourage no one to waste their hard work ethics at this company. If you're a college student they will not work around your hours. The workers including management love drama and mess. If you're not part of certain groups you will get over looked. Wants you to work past scheduled time. Schedule says close 11pm you will be cleaning the store until 12am.
bad,Working at target is boring there is not career change to learn you stay in one section doing the same job and not learning different sections I wouldn’t recommend working at target
bad,Bad job didn’t enjoy it and was underpaid severely they should pay people more to deal with bad customers and managers this job was overall just not a good time.
bad,Plenty of retail management experience but I wasn’t a brown noser. That should be listed as a job requirement. The closing TL whose mommy is Facebook buddies with the STL. Was awful !! They promote solely on how well you kiss butt and tattle on your coworkers. I’d get plenty of 14 hour shifts whenever buddies didn’t show up for their shifts! Stay away! Employee turnover is ridiculous
bad,"I was harassed and threatened by the same coworker for a year, reported her multiple times and they fired me when putting us back on the same schedule"
bad,"You don’t have to worry about working hard or learning new things. Just become friends with HR and the rest of management, and you’ll succeed. The hard work of your team as well as your own is ignored when you’re not part of the click that exist in every store. Different set of expectations is a common thing. I feel so much better not working there. Every former employee I talk to also says the same thing. Avoid working for target."
bad,Horrible management. Will not work with you about anything even health wise. After being hospitalized and almost passing away I came back and could not do work like I use to and even had doctors notes saying I need to take it easy I put in a two week notice so I could do college full time and they let me go the second day of coming back because I could not do what they needed.
bad,"I worked there for almost 2 years, at first I absolutely loved it there. I made a lot of new friends, the managers were friendly and genuinely seemed to care about us. My checks were amazing and I was finally able to start saving money and getting myself off my feet to move out of my parents. Then suddenly they cut our hours and told us that there would be no foreseeable increase in hours, we were getting around 12-20 maximum. Then our managers left and we got new ones, they are all terrible and yell and scream at the people that work there for almost no reason. I left Target because of the favoritism and toxicity displayed by all of the leaders at that store."
bad,"Working here is not fun, you feel like you're replaceable, never appreciated, terrible management. Your job title is not your job title you've got to do many other jobs as well"
bad,This is the most low life piece of s.h.i.t  job since Walmart!! This company will make you go postal and snap on somebody they treat you liked dirt! Yes
bad,"Do not let it being the best place in the world to shop fool you. Every minute of your day is micromanaged out to the second. Have a guest interaction? Well that's time lost from pushing your U-boat and your team lead will be called incompetent because you were unable to finish. I tried giving team members extra time to account for guest interactions but was caught and repremanded for not having them on proper time goals. "
bad,its a good for a starter or college student job but for anything else is poorly. the managers are not helpful at all. they put you down if you miss one day of job. favoritism plays a lot in store 614 target northeast. overall had a bad experience working there. came in all excited and came out pretty disappointed to the point of not wanting to return back for a seasonal or part time position again.
bad,"Target, as a whole, is an okay company to work for.  Their management, however, does not know how to properly run their stores.  They will be kind when they need something, but malicious when it doesn't necessarily go their way.  The coworkers are generally okay."
bad,"The College graduates you hire are idiots. They need to learn respect towards the workers. Very few floor managers can do the job of which they are managing, Lack of any type of live management experience. They lack any kind of human compassion especially for the retirees that have to work to make ends meet. In other words pathetic place and the owners should be tared and feathered."
bad,"good place to work if youre a beginner, you can gain experience from alot of things. just go to reword everyhing. such a answering phonecalls for target. youre basically a receptionist."
bad,"Target continues to hire more and more workers and never gives the current workers any hours. There were MANY complaints about this among my coworkers as well as they do not pay any attention to hour schedule. They will ignore what you availability is and schedule you the EXACT hours you said you couldn’t work. My friend had an availability for the over night shift 4 to 12 target began to schedule her 12 to 8 without her acknowledgment and did not listen to what she had to say about not being able to work the hours. Along with that they will schedule you off for days in a row and not have anyone work your area for days, leaving your work to pile up for you when you get back."
bad,"Work hours are very inconsistent, one week you will 12 hours the next almost 40. Refuses to work with your school/ or any schedule you may need. New Manager says “will not hire if you have any obligations other than target.” ALOT of drama, has a lot of staff but won’t schedule the staff in order to get that monthly bonus for HR for staying under the suggested hours; leaving there two cashiers during the day then two at, then also having the sales floor with barely anyone which means we back up cashier then get in trouble and our job threatened because the store doesn’t look the best. The team leads abuse their power heavily, and when you talk to HR or any management about any situation you get retaliated against. They record you working so if you don’t talk to ONE guest you’re in trouble, if they call you into work and you say no you’re in trouble for “not contributing”, overall the job is ridiculous. No wonder the turn over rate is so high."
bad,"ive worked for target for about 4 years now and ive mostly always enjoyed going to work and loving my job. however mid last year to now has been the worst. the store manager jaggs is incompetent, he treats his employees like expendable trash, countless accounts of perverse acts of trying to look down the females clothes, always expecting a ridiculous amount of work done in an unreasonable amount of time. no matter the amount of work we put into the job we are never good enough going to work is unbearable, morale is the lowest its ever been. yet nothing is done to change this, its as if this is the norm target is going for now. instead of building your employees up the norm now feels like its totally fine to tear all of your employees down to the ground. not to mention all he does is just stand around and look at you and act like you have done nothing yet you have done so much work at least thats what has happened to me. i used to have so much passion for my job but now that passion is dieing rapidly as it is for many other at the highland indiana location. this store needs help so if you are applying for this one DO NOT at least not as long as he is store manager"
bad,Target has somehow completely missed the train that all other retail stores took that leads to communication and functionality. Very poor environment.
bad,the have a 90 day probation peroid for new hires and paind bi weekly for me it was a sturgglur becasue my first check had to wait a month and i was playing catch up on my bills
bad,"Front end supervisor was the worst no compassion and the other GSA could not run a front end right. I was in management before so I know bad Management, they have it there. They should all be demoted and new people put in there place."
bad,"There no room to move up at this company,they want you to work for little pay.The people I work with we was family and team players.if has to say anything else they should update they policy every year,and also check out the price changes that happen in the store."
bad,Take my word on this. Target is cancer. Hours are being slashed drastically and the work load increases. They expect you to kill yourself for them and give you very little hours.
bad,This company doesn't care about their employees. Very little training was granted and they expect you to be the top in every situation with very little training and benefits to back it up. its a good place for a first job right out of or while in highschhol but anything after that is bad. the pay is garbage and management there is very poor.
bad,"Horrible company to work for. They don’t care about you one bit. Changes happen at the drop of a hat, rules are not followed, upper management is cliquey and immature. Favoritism is a thing here. For your sanity, do not work here."
bad,I worked 5 years to long here. Its an ok job if your in school or your trying to watch your income so your ssi doesnt get cut off. My experience with this Target was l was over worked and underpaid. So l became disillusioned with the job. There is also a backroom bully with a really bad attitude that made my work day challenging. Since she was a lifer with Target she pretty much owned the backroom. My Supervisors never disciplined or tried to talk to her about attitude. HR was a joke... so l tolerated a bad co worker who  had free reign over management. I like Popeye took l could stand and l couldnt stand anymore!  I would just say to any applicant prepare to have your hours fluctuate and always have a second job to compensate for the slow times.
bad,"During a typical day at work I was extremely stressed out. There were always unreasonable goals to reach in unreasonable amounts of time. I did learn a lot, however, about customer service, making sales, and time management. The management at this job was the worst I have ever seen, aside from about two people. Management was extremely rude and talked down to employees constantly. The overall culture of the job was only made great by the amazing, kind, and hard-working employees. The hardest part of the job was going to work in a place where I did not feel respected, welcomed, or valued. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in an area that I was well educated in and being in a fairly secluded part of the store."
bad,The management treats you like garbage all the time and its cuz the new rules from corporate let them. NEVER WORK HERE!!!! It is seriously the worst place ever!
bad,A fast retailer looking to burn through American workers to earn profit without consideration to the people they employ. Their retail structure is a joke and the very reason they can’t seem to catch the enthusiasm of their own marketing campaigns.
bad,Target was a cool job if you don't have responsibilities. Store always hiring but never have hours. Never have over time and always expect you to do superhuman. Holidays are the worse.
bad,"The company is one of the worst places to work!!! The SOM, and OM are there to make a hostel work environment and target employees they deem “not target brand”. They will make up things to write you up for and after you leave tell other employees why they left making up lies..  they run this company like a dictatorship."
bad,it's a great place to work for about a year . other than that it's very very hard to level up in the work place . they promise highe title and you never recieve them . they over work their teams and have unrealistic views on work plans . all around it depends on the store you work at and how they work as a team and sadly most stores don't .
bad,"Management was vary aggressive in its  bad behavior and quite cruel vary had to communicate with and inflexible to there employees need and want’s, extremely uncaring and unfriendly no leadership skills just paperwork management and really bad at handling rude customer just letting them do whatever they wont and blaming there staff instead of taking responsibility and telling disruptive customer to leave."
bad,"You heard me right, if you have health issues you should not work here. They will try to fire you. I almost had a heart attack & they did not care at all."
bad,I worked at target for 10 years and I highly don’t recommend it to anyone that it’s trying to succeed in life. The management is the worst and they treat you as if you were a slave
bad,Worst place to work doesn't offer enough hours promises you're forwarding gives him lucky if you get seven horrible management make promises they can't keep prices are too high there discounts sucks
bad,"It's a retail environment. They expect maximum effort for minimal pay. I left the job because one of the executive Team Leaders was harassing me sexually. The Store lead kept asking me if i was ""sure it happened"" and the HR manager would not check the cameras. At the end of it all, I was asked to relocate because they thought she did nothing wrong. Worked there for 9 years and never had any incidents but that one, the manager was had less than one year under their belt."
bad,"My manager was horrible, and unprofessional. When it came time for them to tell staff who they were keeping past holiday, mine told me the only reason she was keeping me was because of my open schedule. She made a hostile work environment and was part of the reason I left."
bad,"not a bad part time job or first job. alot of friendly people in management, and many good employees. i didnt get as many hours as i asked for though."
bad,Target sucks to work for and the management is even worst. I learned that you can't trust anyone that works there . No matter what you do it's never enough. If you get sick you will get your hours cut and you will be used. If they need you they except you to jump and come running and if you don't they act like little children and cut your hours.
bad,No i would not go back there i hatr it they dont act right employee are rude for no reason and they dont do their job like just stand and talk or be on their phone
bad,"After the remodel of ankeny many new hires were made and a few old people stayed as well. They were all rude and never would help when needed. When I asked for help to transfer to a different store while I was at school, I was told i would be helped by two different managers that never went further than that. Because of them my transfer went in too late and I am unable to work at that store now"
bad,The stress from this job is unreal for the amount of work they require you to accomplish. The pay is nothing for what they expect you to do. No communication among team leads and managers. Not a good company to work for if you want to move up. Opinions are not wanted just work you like a dog.
bad,"This place is a joke. Only reason why anyone stays is because of the pay. Favoritism, talking behind people’s backs, understaffing, unrealistic expectations, you can apply for 25-30 hours a week and get 40 even if you tell them that you can’t make it out there that often & if you try to change your availability it will get denied. BUT a pizza party will fix everything. I hate it here but I feel like I’m stuck because of they pay"
bad,"Do not work here unless you like being yelled at and being pulled in every direction. They managers and team leads do nothing but talk about other employees and that is not professional. Also, my manager for my department liked to mess with people's money just to be Petty. I seriously advise people not to work here... The customers are no better and will make your day worse."
bad,Culture and Management is awful!! Racism in stores are at an all time high! Gave my 2 weeks notice and got out of there!! I would never recommend anyone to work for this company
bad,target is a okay store management could be better pay you 13 a hour but so much work to be done in a short shift under scheduling and lack of employees showing up for work
bad,I don't have many kind things to say about working here. I had a poor management team and did not enjoy my daily duties as an employee of target. I would not recommend to a friend.
bad,Target is a discriminating Liberal company. If You are a Christian they will make it so You can't advance plus they will make sure You can't do Your job. They will falsify documents and forge Your name on them.
bad,Awful place to work. Managers are disrespectful and only care about their own jobs and money. Have been disrespected by the store leader and told to use my brain. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy.
bad,had captain-ship over the Guest Service Desk and implemented new processes for staff that required them to have an open dialogue with every customer in order to provide a more personalized experience which lead to more effective workflow and customer satisfaction.
bad,I’ve been working at the fridley super target for almost 4 years now and over the past 2 the culture change has been  terrible to say the least. Between micromanaging and lack of compassion from upper management and constant  harassment from the team leads it’s be come a vary toxic work environment.
bad,"I applied to target for a year before getting hired on. While I was there a new manager took over and everything slowly got worse. Target doesnt care about your work ethic or how much you get done. The only way to advance is if you are good at sucking up to management and being as fake as possible. You can work in a department for two years and apply to be lead then get shot down and expected to train the person, who has been with the company a month, to do the job you have been doing. The district managers dont care about the workers in the store and frankly none of management knows how to hustle like a floor worker. Dont waste your time with a target store. Unless you are an outsider applying for a higher up position, dont expect any job advancement. If you get hired as a sales floor worker you will stay a sales floor worker until they squeeze you out. It is not worth the discount which isn't very good to begin with, it's not worth your time. You are better than this red dungeon."
bad,"the only thing that matters is the stock price, stock holders and the return on investment each employee brings to the department.  If the department doesn't generate income it's not necessary."
bad,"Though a long time ago, the same manager is still at Target.  I would say at the time he was a rookie manager not knowing his background.  This person came from the consulting world to the corporate world. This person (unnamed to avoid an almost certain lawsuit) was as totally unprepared for his position as you can get and commanded no respect.   The other problem at Target was the high ratio of HR to employees and like most people in the corporate world, especially HR, are looking to justify their position.  So it felt a little like a1984 Orwellian experience with HR everywhere picking away.    Eventually, I was pushed out of the company and then felt absolutely no pity for Target when it got hit with the recession, hackers and that bathroom controversy. But there were some good people caught in the downturn with layoffs, just wish that unnamed manager got his due.   On the plus side, great 401K and I even have a small pension and meet some great people."
bad,bad company to work for unless your desperate  and need the money dont work here! if only i could give a 0 rating i would never never never never never never never work here please
bad,They don’t appreciate the hard work that you do. They don’t care if you are pregnant.  They still expect you to push and carry heavy items. Your stl and etls pretend they care about your hard work but then you hear them talk down about other coworkers.
bad,I dreaded going into work everyday because there was a woman in upper management that did nothing but bully and demean me every time she had the opportunity.  I always had a smile on my face.  I always worked as hard as I could.  I was great at customer service and yet she always found something negative to say to me. She was my direct supervisor and I was sick everyday thinking about having to go in and deal with her.  She was always angry and never smiled unless or course corporate was visiting our store then she became another person.  She had her favorites and if you weren't a favorite you were screwed. I really thought I was going to love working there.  I love beauty and cosmetics and I loved the people I worked with and my customers.  Its a shame that some people just get away with so much and enjoy making others lives miserable.
bad,"Rude management,did not care about employees trying to make ends meet, always cutting back hours.Alot of favoritism and the ones that are the favorites are incompetent in there job roles.Sad."
bad,The management at this place is absolutely awful. They have no idea what they are doing and I have no idea how the even graduated college. I have never met people so stupid in my life and so clueless to there surroundings.
bad,Target find faults in the little things before handling the bigger issues. Management does not know how to encourage their team. They tend to tear them down more often then actually congratulating them on something or motivating them. Management has even written up a team member for leaning up against a desk as the team member was working while in the backroom. Management is meant to encourage and motivate not to tear down and discourage.
bad,"I have a floor LOD (leader of the day) harrass me even when I was doing my job. She was very rude to me and basically ran me out even when I did what I was told! When I would bring it up to other LODs, I would be told to just ignore her and her words. After I left, she harrassed 3 other people as well and they all quit right after another. Target nerfd to handle the issue before I ever reccomend someone to ever work there."
bad,Very stressful environment to work in. The customers were definitely a huge con to the workplace. Dealing with MANY rude customers drove me to leave sooner than I intended. One can only handle so much. Target employees are hard workers and are underappreciated.
bad,I didn't like working there at all. My Target career was very short due to unfair scheduling and ambiguous management requirements. They sure ask a lot of you when they pay you so little.
bad,"As a person with cashier experience, it was absolutely appalling to see that registers were traded out among different people throughout each shift and money was never counted nor were people held responsible for their own money. You are not given a discount as they tell you that you are. You can only use the 10% off discount if you have the Target Red Card, which, was the main selling point for Target rather than any of its product. Floor managers made a small commission for the number of red cards signed on their shifts so they really would target and demand that you very clearly harass people until they agree to sign up for such a risk."
bad,My issue with the job is the managers were rude. Some of the coworkers had bad attitudes. Some of the team leads made me & others feel like they smothering us. When doing your job they would complain. Schedule is always messed up. They’re’s so much problems here.
bad,"The workloads were frequently impossible to complete and the number of employees we had at our disposal (and divided into each department) were too few. We were constantly berated for how little we were able to accomplish each day and given nothing to improve our circumstances. My department should've had at least four people working and maintaining the area at all times, but I was alone 99% of time no matter how much I pleaded for help in the workload. I was always told that there simply weren't enough employees on for that night all while I could hear half a dozen or so doing nothing and cackling like hyenas amongst one another. "
bad,The management sucked. There were too many managers that were telling employees different thing to do at the same time. The truck unloads were done at a rapid and unsafe pace. Any attempts to complain via work chain were met with contempt.
bad,Yes the payrate is rising but what target does is cut your hrs to make your pay the same. In a nut shell I wouldnt recommend working forTarget unless your a high school student
bad,"I've never worked at Target, I worked at Target Park which is a totally different company..."
bad,"it is just a very stressful work place. Not enough equipment to get things done and managers have a very unrealistic expectation of when you should get things done. After Christmas you basically need to get a new job because you are only given 1-2 days a week and not full shifts for months, about until June comes around then they start giving abit more hours."
bad,"Target was one of the worst places I have ever worked. The managers were all rude, demeaning, and abusive. Through training they will make you feel horrible  and make you feel stupid for things you haven’t learned how to do. They’ll give you rude looks, won’t say hello back to you in the morning, not interested in helping you learn. They made me cry every single day. I lasted almost 3 weeks and I couldn’t take it anymore. I went to HR and complained about the managers I was reporting to and she said they had problems with the guy manager before yet they do nothing."
bad,Management getting their clicks then promote useless people who are lazy. Not enough countability. Turning into Walmart not caring about Guest. Little to none possibility of moving up and Company
bad,management refuses change and one bad manager can ruin the experience as they are sales driven and follow that more than employee well being which is a bummer
bad,Has gone way downhill since I first started.  They hire kids fresh out of college for management that have no clue.  Did not like going to work in the atmosphere the store provides.   Very unprofessional
bad,"Extreme favoritism used by management, Would not consider you for promotion unless degree was obtained. Hi expectations with low pay  A lot of unethical things done in order to make numbers for the store ."
bad,It’s not something you’d want to put yourself through. If you work here it is a temporary stop in life and shouldn’t ever be something more than that.
bad,"Your experience will be dependent on who you work for and what department. My store recycled the same few incompetent managers from department to department, which led to awful morale."
bad,They promise you anything to get you in the door.management has no clue how to run a business and lie to every one about every thing.you can't get enough hour to pay your bills do those periodic osys raise aren't worth much.the stress of working there coupled with the rudeness of the customers isn't even worth the effort.
bad,"Target in Metairie Louisiana is the worst place to work at. They make you work in other departments that you have no training in when they are short staffed. They make the closing shift stay after they close, which they close at 12am. We was leaving at 1 to 1:30 am, picking up after other people in other departments. The apparel department was the worst, they don't hire enough people to work. They rather put the workload of 4 people on one person. It would be past 1 am and clothes still on the ground and piles of clothes just resting in multiple baskets. The 'Go Backs"" was like a nightmare. By far the most horrible place I have ever experienced. Don't let me get started on management, it would be a whole essay. I do not recommend this tragedy."
bad,"If you have a family,bills or like money don’t work here. They’ll take advantage of you quickly. They’ll change your Department just because someone else has a work conflict and your hours will drop from 40 to 13. Without warning!!!! Management doesn’t care about your personal life don’t ever get sick have a baby get jury duty nothing. Be a robot and make target your life."
bad,"Just work somewhere else. I know $13 an hour and benefits sound amazing! BUT, the reality is that they ONLY schedule you up to about 15-25 hours a week so your paychecks are small and inconsistent and since you are below 30hrs a week you don't get benefits. ALSO, management is a nightmare. Period. HR is no help [and super vindictive] and your supervisors are wild cards. It will drain you fast and cause stress and major disruption to your personal life. They use the higher minimum wage to get away with murder in terms of making you do jobs outside of your role, requirements, and expertise."
bad,Working here was a terrible experience. I worked at the fitting room and was also the person who answered the stores phone whenever someone called. You are overworked and you're required to do multiple duties at once. They had me work every single weekend as a closing shift while they let the other fitting room employee work opening shifts only and she always had weekends off. There is favoritism at this job and the managers were horrible. My Team leader constantly picked on me and bothered me all the time. And I wasn't the only person who felt this way about her. When the lines get long upfront they call people for backup and expect you to go running to them and If you don't come up front they will go looking for you and force you to go help with backup. You are on your feet for hours with only a 15 min break and they tell you what time you can go on your lunch and breaks like you're a child. They are not flexible with schedules if you can't work the hours they want you to then they'll fire you. By far the worst place I've worked at. Apply at your own risk!!!
bad,"I couldn't speak to the environment now. But when I was there we had a saying. ""If it isn't broken, corporate will mess with it until it is"".  The environment was the equivalent of dealing with cliques in high school,  only this was from middle age management."
bad,"Working at target for over a year, I have been going through EXTREME stressed induced depression and anxiety causing me to start medication. I would have constant panic attacks on the sales floor. This started when new management entered the store and turned it into a hostile work environment. 2-3 team members were quitting EVERY week. Management does not care about their team members and talk down with insults and that ""there are hundreds of other people that will take your place"" threat."
bad,"The managers will lie to your face. They will cut your hours down to nothing if you call in one day. They want you to do the work of like 4 people while you are there but also want you to get all of what they tell you to do instantly. There is no communication between leaders. Everyone has their own idea of what company standard is, but they all differ from eachother."
bad,"The target in El Centro is the worst place to work! The ""team leads"" are incompetent, and know nothing about leadership. It was a terrible experience."
bad,Target is a good place to work at if you're looking for good pay but it does come with a lot of cons. You can't exactly get a job at Target if you don't know anybody who works there so you have to keep calling in order to get hired.
bad,"After investing nearly 8 years I’ve been treated extremely poorly, filed 13 reports against my executive for his retaliation and no change occurred, even harassment and nothing so I’m ready for a positive environment."
bad,"If you aren't applying for corporate, don't even bother. Pay is lower than most other stores. They rely heavily on the few solid employees they have and will actually proactively block them from moving up into district or corporate rather than run the risk of having to develop talent."
bad,"Basically I was a consistent closer to constantly close the store and held there past midnight on nights I told them I had school. As a college student and me informing that to them up front, you would think they would understand that but they didn’t and didn’t seem to care. Management seemed to show favoritisms as well."
bad,"I was harassed by the HR person while working there. I dreaded every day she was the Lead for the night. It was so bad, other employees were asking what the deal was."
bad,Low hours and low pay. Managment will yell at you for whatever reason they feel like. Managment will pick and choose who they give more hours to. Even if you have been there the longest and have more knowledge about the store they will overlook you and never recognize you.
bad,Don't make enough to pay bills and keep food in your house to feed your family. Management wants you to get your job done in 4 hours when the job actually require 8 hours at the most to have everything they want done finished.
bad,If u work good u will be awarded by being given the slackers work! Certain employees are aloud to break rules. You wont get hours. They do have 401k which is the only pro. Upper management consist of immature kids fresh out of college that often has temper tantrums. Also if you are one of their favorites then u can pretty much show up to work when ever you want!
bad,Target is bending over backwards making changes trying to keep up with Amazon and it is a disaster Everyone's responsibilities are changing weekly and in turn there is no accountability. There are the lazy people that are just there for a check... and the others like me that would work twice as hard to pick up the lazy partners slack. Management was either unwilling to get me help of unable due to hours allotted by corporate.
bad,"Management have no communication with each other, and blames employees when managers are at fault. I was given work to do by one manager, then another manger comes and tells me to do different, making the job take longer to finish, then I get blamed for it not being done on time, instead of of them owning up to their own lack of communication with each other."
bad,You will do everyone else’s job. You will be yelled at for being a minute late but expected to stay extra and then yelled at cause of payroll. I have been here a year. Absolutely horrible.
bad,I’ve been working here for a little over 2 years & I still have to beg for hours. Staff/Management is rude store is nasty & no set schedule. Benefits are little to none if any. They hire people for full time but give them two days of work (12) hours while others that don’t do their job get 30 hours. Worst place in retail to work! Do not DO NOT apply or work here.
bad,I worked many years ago in Arlington Texas and it was not a good environment. The human resources woman was biased and I would never recommend Target as a job to anyone.
bad,Not a good place to work I worked there for a few years and things were constantly changing. The people acted nice to your face but turned around and talked bad about you. If I even go in to shop like a normal customer now I can't and get watched like I am going to steal something.
bad,horrible! they constantly change things and would rather let go of workers who have been there the longest if they do not conform rather than find a different job for them. the managers are miserable and do not motivate the staff at all! DEFINITELY NOT A SO CALLED TEAM
bad,"It's retail. No matter what area you work in, you've got to sell Target Red Cards. Even working in freight, you've got to push Red Cards. You barely get enough time to do your actual job, especially when there are no floor associates around so you end up having to help customers (not part of your job) and get behind on working freight. If you get injured or get assaulted, keep your mouth shut or you will get replaced ASAP."
bad,Hello if you wanted a proper review you would not make me re write it over and over again. So here it is the Best Team survey does not match the needs of any Team Member expected to perform to the standards of SOM's senior operations managers that never show up to work before 9am and expect everyone else to work around the clock.
bad,"This place is like being back at high school again but this time you're paid for it. Catty whiny managers who don't understand the level of work the employees do constantly barking at you to do more, unrealistic expectations with an unrealistic timeframe, no support network from management at all, constantly expected to work outside your normal job role, everyone at the store is cliquey and hateful. You're expected to work overtime every single day and you are not paid extra or recognized for it but if you don't do it you're seen as a bad employee. You can only use the discount if you pay cash or apply for and are approved for the target red card which is super scummy. I would leave this place exhausted and in tears from how badly I was treated by management daily. Wouldn't wish working here on my worst enemy."
bad,Always hundreds of guest.usually only ever one cashier management doesnt care and will not help they will just say figure it out. This is not just at the lanes its every where through out the store
bad,The manager was very rude to the customers and the employees. The schedule was organized. I asked numerous times to stay over and was not paid for it.
bad,I have been working for target the last almost 6 years I dont like what they are doing with the company dony like their directive and dont like how they are treating employees management is a waste of space and what they expect of us is like a 5 person job
bad,Horrible management and no sense of communication in departments at all. Understaffed. Hours are always cut with or without notice. Will certainly be looking for new job.
bad,Working at this company it’s very stressful do to management Management promises you opportunity tomorrow but never followed through so don’t expect to move up
bad,"At target you will meet the first be greeted with what seems like the nicest people. After your 90's day is up; a lot will change. Target treats you great at first but it slowly gets worst. The management team have no respect for team members. The treat you like you are in middle school. They will watch your every move. Overall I do not advisor anyone to work at Target. I know first hand, I have been working there for 4 years. The team members have kept me from leaving. At target it is easy to get comfortable."
bad,Management is poor after the holidays all hours get cut i worked maybe 10 hours a week after christmas ended. Would not recommend if you have any sort of bills to pay.
bad,"Horrible team players no one likes to help each other, very selfish employees! Team leaders are very unprofessional and don’t know how to talk to people! Team leaders are lazy! Employees are lazy they don’t work they always on their phones!"
bad,"Managers don’t know what they’re doing, there are childish cliques, they never answer the phone. The rotating schedule is stupid and unnecessary. They can’t keep employees and are always understaffed. They hired me to work in an area I never got to work in. I was stuck at register my entire time there when I was hired to work in Guest services and on the floor."
bad,"Absolutely terrible to employees.  They try and pretend that they care about everyone and that it's a big family but that's just a load. They claim to be flexible with hours but that is a lie. They also CONSTANTLY schedule people outside of availability without asking and then get angry when that person complains or does not work those hours. And I've spoken to someone who makes the schedules sometimes. When you try to schedule someone for a time or day they are not available, a message pops up. So they simple choose to ignore it and schedule people outside of availability anyways. "
bad,"Keep looking it’s better jobs out Obscenities, discriminatory language, or other language not suitable for a public forum"
bad,I was hired for a seasonla cashier position by the store manager who had only been there 2 days. in january we were supposed to be told if we would continue working or get let go at the end of the holiday season. I was told continuously by the cashier surperviser that i would be notified. When the time came for school and i needed to change my scedule my boss waited until my availability request was denied (thursday) to tell me i would be let go after the season ends (sunday) the staff is uninterested and sneaky. the job is only worth it if you are desperate or getting a salary.
bad,New hires make the same as some one who has been with company 4 - 5 years. If you are lazy they love you. If you work hard you get 20 a week. I feel unappreciated most of the time.
bad,I have medical issues and school issues so I took a leave of absence and they fired me. they don't care about your health and your issues going on. They also don't give you any days off that you really need off. uncooperative.
bad,"Recently, like other workplaces, Target has undergone ""modernization."" This has changed every aspect of expected workload and the time those tasks take. Now management expects unrealistic amounts of work to be accomplished in a time frame that is near impossible."
bad,"When you apply for this company, you cannot change your schedule for a full 90 days after applying. This restriction is very limiting and ignorant. Not only that, the lack of bring able to reschedule small shifts is even worse with management not cooperating even with highschool employees"
bad,There were many security issues I had to deal with. protocol was NEVER followed even in situations of injures. Management was mediocre at best. Best thing that came out of that job was the experience by watch others on what to not do. They say that they are inclusive and diverse but its the opposite. There is a lot of group mentality such as a high school where they use favorites not based on work efficacy or knowledge. Most of the time I had to do Visual merchandising and soft lines presentation and wasn't fairly compensated for it.
bad,"the management is the worst. everyone is given unrealistic expectations. Softlines are given two departments to take care of in one shift including stocking both areas (stocking loads can be very heavy), keep areas zoned perfectly at all times, respond to fast service, respond to clean up the fitting room and sort out strays etc....all made to be done before your shift is over. leaving us to be overwhelmed to complete exhaustion. the teams leads have no interest to help out to make sure all departments are ok or willing to jump in and help out. one team lead is very belittling and disrespectful and upper management is no help at all. when concerns are brought up to HR, it is brushed off and made to be our faults. I recommend that nobody apply to Target especially the Lake Park location. The new modernization is failing miserably and team members are walking out weekly."
bad,"nothing was all that bad when I initially started but since last year everything has gone severely downhill. everyone in management is rude and condescending and have no problem personally attacking you. you will not find help from anyone with a status above team member. If you attempt to speak with HR or a Team Lead about a concern they will brush it off or become extremely defensive and punish you for it later in your work load. no one receives hours they are promised and we are short scheduled daily. many people are quitting because of the hostile environment and unrealistic expectations. If you think you want to work at Target, good luck. within a week you will understand why its so awful. do not apply here. do not shop here. someone call corporate and tell them we are drowning and being mistreated and its caused several employees emotional distress, enough to hospitalize one. S.O.S"
bad,"target over works they give the work of 2 to 3 people yourself and the give so little time to work it out, it is so stressful, management treat employees like trash. i dont recommend to work at this place."
bad,Everyone was un organized  no one really got trained and they didn’t care if people really showed up or not it was just overall a bad experience I don’t recommend target for anyone
bad,the management was at time disrespectful and wanted you to the job of 3 people when you are only getting paid for 1 person and if there was a call off they would not really try to find someone to come in
bad,"Management doesn't support their employees and will throw them under the bus whenever it makes them look better. Ridiculous work schedules--if you want/need hours, you will get very few and when you need time off, you will be scheduled for full shifts."
bad,they was nothing but a bunch of lieing people.you get hired in at one thing then told something completely different I would never tell anyone to work at at target.
bad,"I was treated very poorly and my life outside of target was never considered important , my hours were always comprised . I was targeted by multiple managers."
bad,"Over worked and under paid. Target works people until they psychically can't take it anymore, Horrible culture where it is impossible to be honest with leadership. False hopes and lies about advancement to get team members to work hard."
bad,Too much drama for a basic retail job. Did not have many opratunaties or consistency with sceduels. no verbal warnings only write ups which semed extreme and drove most high school employees off. naturally that was most of the work force
bad,"poor management , higher ups tend to not care for employees, very little hours, I have been working for target for a year now the position I am in I never applied for in the first place I only took it to be the best in it which I am so that they can switch me to the position I wanted which they haven't and I've been trying to move to different positions since I've started."
bad,"Managers will not help you but blame you, HR will not help you only ignore you, coworkers will not help you but continue the abuse, avoid target because they will do nothing unless the police or a lawyer is involved"
bad,"Management is lazy, uneducated & terrible! Hours/pay suck! Small 5 hr shifts with the work of a 10 hour shift. Conflicting instructions! No healthcare"
bad,The benefits is trash unless your team lead if you are not you will not get no type of benefits no perks the hours trash they cut back I was don't give you enough hours to work how can you pay a bill with 15 hours a week management sucks excuse my language.
bad,"Target has changed  from a  fun family environment place to work for, to a part time job with more work added and less hours to do it. With the new wage increase, people will be hired in making more than current employees who have been there several years. They pick and choose who will stay and get hours. I would not recommend anyone that wants full time hours to apply. You can’t trust anyone in management to give clear answers or tell the truth."
bad,Just a poor place to work for. They don't treat you fairly. Its hard to improve your role. basically basically it takes years to move up the chain. Just not a place to work at all.
bad,okay company not that of a good environment. a lot of work is assigned in so little time. they expect to much for the pay rate. could be a better place environment.
bad,"Honestly I miss it but only because I had to leave or have them fire me and I left so I could recover from an accident. the jobs were not too hard but as I had gotten into a car accident things all changed. I used to work about 7 hours working on the floor, backroom, and truck team."
bad,"Terrible hours and minimal flexibility.  Huge corporation, so the lowest on the rung is inconsequential but also recieves huge pressure to perform.  Stressful and negative environment, huge amounts of product waste daily."
bad,Was basically high school but as a job. Constant bickering and comments from every person. Not a career job for sure. Summertime job or a job while you are going to school.
bad,Got promoted and was thrown in to the position never trained. Was a team member and got promoted but never trained me in the position was yold i would get help but ehen i asked i was told to figure it out so i did i trained myself and did a great job.
bad,"only work here if you need the money and can't do anything else. Management is terrible. Hours are inconsistent. They don't care how hard you work, they pay everyone the same."
bad,worked here for almost 5 years and i kept getting passed over for promotions because the main team lead did not like me due to the fact that i did not know spanish. management decided to promote some one who had only been there for 6 months rather than myself or two other team members who had been there for almost 5 years and we had already been managing our own areas of the store and had been crossed trained. also team lead would put herself with areas that required the least amount of work and always showed up for work late.
bad,I am only giving so many hours to do my job and less hours to do my job. I am a very hard worker. I come to work everyday and do my job. I love helping people try to succeed in life. I give it 100 percent each and everyday I'm there at work. Target hires bodys instead of workers and that now how I feel a work place should be. Don't get me wrong I love what I do it's just the management her is not working for me anymore. I need a new start around people that are willing to give a 100 percent as I do. I start my day off with doing my pills and working them all out. Once I finish that I work the freight off the truck.
bad,Treated employees like animals.  Treated with disrespect.  I would not reccomend anyone working there. Pay is not good. No benefits.  It just all around is not a good employer
bad,"always short staffed. doesn't stand by return policy. Team leads go over front end managers heads and doesnt support us when theres a customer dispute, lack of communication."
bad,Constantly cutting hours. When they go over and other departments the whole store gets cut for hours not a good place to work if you have bills to pay also the reason they stay in in their hours that are allotted is because the bonus checks would be less if they go over on our so they just making their paychecks bigger and fatter while you are just get smaller and smaller
bad,"A typical day at Target is Very stressful because the team leads can target you and ride your back all day and not one person in charge will put that person in check it will go on until they get tried of it and go to someone else she will keep asking you all day what do you have left to do a thousand times until its time for your day to be over and keep giving you other things to do as well so that way you don't have  enough time to finish then they want to know why you couldn't finish on time, its just the most stressful job ever..."
bad,"The most awful place I’ve ever been damned to work. If working 1-3 5 hour shifts a week isn’t bad enough. The rude team leads will be the frosting on the cake. To most of them if you’re not a pet, you’re nobody. I wouldn’t even take the chance working here. Cause not only will you have no hours, but you’ll be disrespected and unappreciated when you even are there."
bad,"HR is awful, management is awful, everyone is super rude. When I rent to HR to ask questions they didn’t even look me in the eyes. if you’re seasonal they can fire you for anything, I called in sick, and they let me go. They made me drive all the way there, then told me to leave. No notice or anything. I live on my own, and it was a very stressful month because of target.  Don’t work here."
bad,"You should know this before starting for this trash, and, I will never shop at the stores because of the distribution center again. They called me in for an interview, and I got the job. I was told I would be doing one position, and then they decided to try and put me on another position. Then instead of training me on night shift, as promised, they tried to give me another job and train me on days. So I refused the job. After I re-applied there, they told me there is no chance for me to be offered a new position. It was their fault I didn't take the job, and they had no consideration for me at all. They even said they could train me nights, but refused too."
bad,A bunch of blonde white women that pick and choose who their favorites are. No hours. Not enough pay. Just not worth it at all. Very unfair work place. I would not recommend working here unless you are a bratty blonde and you’ll blend right in.
bad,The managers ETIs GSTLs  and STLs  are all very rude inconsiderate of  team members they do not care about development and your overall well-being they have a cliques and it’s all like high school there’s no room to grow at target it’s a very fixed corporation .
bad,"After working for almost 7yrs and loving my job and team members I work with, it is very disappointing to see the direction the company is taking. Yes, they might be doing really well in sales and against competitors but they have forgotten about one of the essential parts of the company, the team members. Raising the minimum wage to $15 but cutting hours to almost nothing is unreasonable in trying to make a living just from working there (you are expected to be available any time any day)."
bad,"Their standards are UNREALISTIC, management is horrible and extremely clicky. They talk poorly of team members behind their backs and have their favorites who can literally do nothing all day while the hard workers pick up the slack. My ETL literally fired me her last day at my store, it was a personal issue with me and that was her goal."
bad,"pay was fine, work was simple, people were intresting, days were either quick or slow. good atmosphere all around, management wasn't to much of a bother and the other team members were all easy to communicate to."
bad,Target is the worst place I have every worked. I have been with the company for just over a year and I have watched my store go down hill. Managers will abuse their power making team members preform duties outside of their job description. Managers can get away with undermining and belittling their employees even when reported to HR. You will get treated worse just for having medical disabilities. The only reason I would ever recommend Target to anybody as if they couldn't even beg for money on the streets.
bad,Corporate decisions suck. no matter if you have been here or are brand new you make the same amount of money . Any raises you have became void when they raised the minimum pay of target ... so you and someone that sucks at there job get paid the same
bad,"Bad place to work with no advancement, no loyalty for employees that have been with the company for years, inconsistent hours, low wages and no overtime"
bad,"Whatever you do DO NOT APPLY TO WORK HERE! The management sucks, all they do is gossip in the break room or come yell at the employees for literally no reason. Hardly any hours. The pay is not worth it!"
bad,Great company but you will be overworked and under appreciated. that's expected when you work for a big retailer...........................................
bad,"Managers only care for themselves they also do not believe in letting team members help each other. Lack of hours and with those lack of hours the managers except you to finish 80 task within the little 5 hours they give you. Managers definitely do not have your back. Managers constantly making fun of team members behind team members back. Certain team members constantly creating drama and managers create more drama. Target is a hostile work place. Managers don't believe in helping their team members out when work load is so heavy it's heard to recover. Corporate is taking away so many departments and adding on more task to team members that already have 100 task to do within 5 hours or less. When you report a manager to corporate, corporate doesn't do anything to these managers and if you give corporate your name when reporting a manager corporate goes back and tell the manager everything and does not do anything to management while the manager you reported cuts your hours. Managers are PETTY, HR at the store that I work at is lazy, only care about the ETL's and do not care about team members."
bad,They grind you up and spit you out.  Management is the worst I've encountered.  Afraid to fire African Americans so they fire the whites - honestly racist.
bad,"No area for growth. "
bad,"Not enough pay or hours"
bad,"working at target made me realize this was not the job i signed up for i thought i was gonna be doing makeup and helping customers with tips and tricks , it was the complete opposite i like it but i didn't love it"
bad,"I work the cash register and a typical day has customers coming in waves - sometimes slow and sometimes many at a time. The pressure to almost badger a customer to take on a "
bad,do not apply or work here their is no job security at all they will work you like a slave and then let you go for no reason. stay away from target.  save yourself the trouble of applying here. the interview process is not even a interview they tell you the job description and then say ok who wants a job. that's 1 red flag right their.  co workers are pretty cool but the management is very poor they need to fire the managers that work their and replace them with  people who know what they are doing.  came into work and they started letting people go for no reason.
bad,"Hard workers get screwed over constantly, better hope you're on management's good side if you want hours. Frequent leadership changes, no actual training, lack of accountability for anything that goes wrong."
bad,"Worst part-time experience in my life. TL’s were stressed out and took it out on personnel. Top management was clueless and  encouraged an atmosphere of backstabbing and poor treatment of team members. You apply and they make you fill out which days/hours of the week you can work. They NEVER even look at it. I was immediately thrust into all closing and weekend shifts. Don’t even get me started on how horrible the closing TL’s were. You would work your butt off your entire shift and then after closing would have to do everyone else’s job because TL’s didn’t make them do it during the day shift. It was a NIGHTMARE! I am an older female and I have never been treated this unprofessionally in my life. Didn’t need the job only took it for something “fun” (hah!) to do and make a few bucks. The environment was so toxic, I ended up quitting after I overheard a TL straight up lying about me (in the hallway where everyone could hear her) to the Store Manager, who ENCOURAGED it by the way. Take my advice, skip it and do not work at the Charlottesville Target. There is a reason they are always hiring for the sales floor."
bad,"Management is the worst I’ve ever had to deal with. Managers will talk badly about you behind your back. They make fun of and don’t take mental health issues seriously. If they see you talking to a coworker for not even five seconds, you’re going to be yelled at. Meanwhile managers literally stand around all day talking to each other right in front of the employees to see. They give special treatment to their favorite employees. They kept promising our raises and they never came. They also cut hours for months and months forcing people to find other jobs to make ends meet. They don’t care about you what so ever here, you are replaceable to them."
bad,It was a fine job when I needed some extra beer money in school but beyond that it is not a good place to work. You will have no room to move up in the company.
bad,"By far the worst job I've ever had.  Management and supervisors were the most irresponsible communication ethic.  Slave labor intensive during nights,  your hard work won't be appreciated.  My advice work anywhere besides target."
bad,3 different store managers during the time I worked there. Hours were inconsistent and vary based upon corporate changes...employees are treated interchangeably.
bad,"Management sucks. Hours weren’t acceptable at all. Favoritism was in effect with the management there. Lack of empathy from staff and guests. Pay was not suitable for the amount of work a team member put into work everyday, we’ll if we were lucky enough to get hours like that."
bad,"I landed my own office in a great company soon after this experience. I had relocated, so I applied for a seasonal position for more savings. They expect you to give up your holidays and save the cashiers continuously. I work with a sense of urgency. My work ethics are up to par; moreover, management on the lower tier lied and told seasonal employees that they can hire all of them when the season was over only to offer no employment opportunities moving forward. "
bad,"I worked here as a college student during breaks. It was an extremely chaotic work environment like I've never experienced before. I was a diligent hard worker, but I always left work exhausted and my achievements were only rewarded with more difficult tasks. My supervisors were not very positive people, they often complained and it was a very discouraging environment. I was never happy to wake up and go to work here. It was a fine job for a student or even a younger person out of school, but I could never imagine making this hellscape into my career."
bad,I work for Target for over 7 months and what I was trying to do is work full time they're very short on hours they barely give you 20 hours a week. Not worth it
bad,"No chance for advancement, unreasonable expectations, taking initiative is punished instead of rewarded, no thought given to through training, management has no idea what they're doing of how to treat employees with respect."
bad,"Horrible management, they speak lowly about you no matter how much you did for them. They do not appreciate hard workers, and reward the bad ones Do not work here."
bad,"While you were assigned with tasks for the day, or even for the next hour or so you are required to do those tasks no matter how many it may be or how little time you are expected to do tasks with no exceptions no matter how busy it was or how little help you may have. The management for the most part do not display the work ethic they expect from team members, some will go and talk to other managers of other departments for hours on end or take an extra 15-20 min on their breaks or sit in the office while on their phones. I may have learned to be an efficient and fast paced worker but I would never suggest any other position outside of cashier at Target. If you may ever have a problem and try to report it to Human Resources you will just get your problem rephrased back at you then no action will be taken upon your statements no matter what it may be"
bad,"My recent experience was the worst job experience I've had in my life. I'm thankful that I can anonymously post about this job. "
bad,You only move up if they like you. Too much favoritism..  No benefits at all no matters how long you work with company. Sometimes employee gets 5 hrs a week.
bad,"Very often I would get asked to fill in for employees, due to the fact that they did not schedule enough people for the day. Constant shifting of objectives was instructed without sufficient time to complete the task at hand."
bad,If you're working at Target past the age of 25 your life has gone wrong somewhere and you need to reevaluate some things. Working here will drain your sanity and intelligence. Common sense is not found nor welcome at Target.
bad,"A day at Target as a Security team-member your days are filled with dealing with the homeless as well as those that steal from the store. You have no real authority if someone is to threaten you and or your team-members, the police within the local area are quite slow to respond to the needs of the store."
bad,I worked there for over seven years and management has gotten really bad. Management is really lazy if you are lucky you work once of twice a week. there's no hours and a lot of favoritism.
bad,"The consumables market team lead is awful.  She is very condescending, demeaning, disrespectful, incompetent, and shows no appreciation for her workers.  The areas that she oversees are backed up from previous days of trucks and it rolls over everyday.  In my opinion,  leaders are supposed to be inspiring, positive, appreciative and uplifting to their employees.  Unfortunately she lacks any of those traits.  Her poor leadership skills and and her  lack of respect for her employees is reflection of the stores poor leadership choices."
bad,Expect you too work over time with hardly no pay.  No support from HR or Management. Takes advantage of employees and offers no incentives with lack of motivation.
bad,"Cashier with registers not accepting Red Cards.  One cashier and two self-checks. Upset customers due to long lines."
bad,"I was promised 35+ hours a week, but averaged 17. I talked to HR 7 times over 8 months about keeping my hours above 20 to pay my minimum bills, but they would fix it one week, then revert back. They don't like paying benefits, so they mess with your hours to keep you below the threshold. Management is inconsiderate; I was yelled at for going to the bathroom and leaving my area unattended despite pressing the button requesting someone cover me multiple times for 10 minutes to no avail. Near constant turnover due to all the issues that I listed and more... Save yourself the stress. It literally cost me money to work here because I had to pull money from my savings regularly to make ends meet. It's not worth it."
bad,"I've been in retail for over ten years and this place is by far the worst place I've been. The management doesn't care one single bit about you and that goes from store level all the way up the food chain. Yea, pay is better then some stores but they short staff the stores so badly just to make up for it and expect you to do 5 people's jobs"
bad,"If you want to work at Target just work at Target i worked for Target Mobile which for whatever reason was outsourced to a different company completely. We worked in Target just not for Target (technically). Essentially no hours, terrible management, they threw me to the sharks on my second day,"
bad,"Started as a full time cashier being told ""id be moved to a stocking position"", long story short they lied, a manager stole me from another manager (when he was the one who interviewed me for his department) to be in her department (cashier), I hadn't met her till after I was hired and she disliked me to the extreme but she didn't want me to go to the manager I was hired from because I worked hard and she hated him. Petty stuff like that from management. They treat you like a piece of meat that they can throw out anytime. GSA's were nice and helpful but whenever managers would come around they would throw you under the bus and blame you for something they did. The only thing that was good was pay but that's not because of target it's because of the growing economy. Cashiers got paid 12hr and every other department (starting) was 12.50hr. I have worked multiple jobs as stocker, electronics, AND cashier and I can testify how cashiering is a much harder and tiresome of a task, that pay difference is unfair. Majority of the time the customers were really nice and would come into your line because they feel like they know you and you end up getting regulars that come in often, it is a nice environment in that aspect but there also were many customers that would say really inappropriate things or yell at you for no reason. It's retail though, that's everywhere. Co-workers only care about themselves and gossip. Environment is very toxic and it is not somewhere you should stay as a career, please find value in yourself that if you do work there, don't stay long. Also their discount"
bad,"Typical day would be always customer service.  Getting help is very difficult as they run the store on a tight schedule, expecting way too much to be done in a short amount of time.  Would not recommend"
bad,Honestly if you are not in management then there are no real opportunities at Target. Since they are raising the minimum wage  they cut employees hours to as low as 5 hours a week. It has a great mission but doesn't follow through. Management is horrible and never communicate well. Always understaffed and you are expected to do the job of multiple employees. The best part about the job would be the coworkers. It used to be a pretty decent place to work but it has just gone down hill.
bad,This used to be a great place to work but the direction the company is not a positive one and they do not care about their hourly employees. The management at this store location is not a happy place to work anymore.
bad,Target is horrible  promise u that u  would rather be broke ! They treat you like rats  the mangers are all bad the gsa are all bad if you don’t Kissain’t good
bad,Not the best work environment. I felt as though the rules didn't apply to everyone there were favorites. they could be more helpful to their employers.
bad,Seriously not worth the time or the effort. Management seems friendly however the moment you cannot complete everyone’s tasks that they hand you in the last hour you instantly drop to the bottom of their list.
bad,"I will admit that it was good in the beginning and that the management was nice, for a while. I got the impression that the company would not be a doormat for self-entitled customers to walk all over. I even believed I would have a reasonable workload."
bad,"Are you hard working? Do you feel like you want to work hard enough to do multiple people's jobs? Do you have a life but want to give your job all your time? Availability? No problem! They'll never look at it, and punish you for trying to go against the fact they dont look at it when writing schedules. Great at adapting? And adapting? And adapting...sometimes a few times a day? Like change? Constantly? Then this is the place for you! Work at target to know number wise, you can work harder and faster than anyone on your team, including your manager, just to be told it isn't enough. It never will be. And if you're good at being fake and two faced, management could happen for you. Especially if you want to kiss up. Be prepared to work pay check to pay check, tired and wanting a new job every day."
bad,Terrible staff and ignorant management. Absolutely terrible with follow up and professionalism. There was consistently drama and chaos between management and associates
bad,"Target hasn't given me anything positivity to say. The harder you work, the less you are appreciated and are asked more of you. I don't mind the hard work or impossible time goals we get everyday, but the worst part is being on the flow team. A small team getting the entire store ready with fresh product, only to be given 4-7 hours a day and have no one appreciate you."
bad,Store was a mess management disnt know what was goin on customers were always complaining managers were hooking up with employees it was a nightmare to work at.
bad,"management is horrible"
bad,"At first I liked the job a lot, but the higher up are there just to be there. They don't encourage you to work better and they don't really care if you work or not. They only care if people kiss up to them and make them feel good about themselves. The TL AND ETL's are no better. They favor certain people to much that they are unable to notice who actually works hard."
bad,Management is horrible low pay for work and duties no hours to go around teamleads always contradict each other and then it always fall back on the team members to pick up their slack
bad,"It’s was not the field I would want to work in, no recognition"
bad,This is a company that died years ago.  Senior leadership is riding it out and trying to make as much many as they can before it's actual death certificate is issued.  Stay away!!
bad,"Management plays games to make it feel like you're always the problem. even if you're there hardest worker. I've seen great, hard working people get fired, simply for asking for a raise"
bad,"Target is a big box magatron. This particular store has huge management issues. When the store flow chart is upside down nothing balances. I was terminated because my new OCD manager, thought that I couldn't keep up. I don't suggest it as a career; it's a volatile place to work and people who are going nowhere are the only ones who stay."
bad,"I don't want to go into full details but if you didn't sell enough red cards, your job was on the line. I had been threatened with losing my job multiple times because I didn't ask a customer, who was buying water, if they wanted to apply for a red card. The company does to debit and credit cards but, you had to have a check. No one carries checks anymore. Many of times I was threatened with losing my job because of that. The management also didn't know how to clarify things when it came to time off. The management as a whole didn't know what they were doing. Then, when I left the company, due to personal reasons that couldn't be helped, they told me that I would never be allowed to work for the company ever again, and then when I went for unemployment, due to the personal reasons, they denied me because, though I told the management why I was leaving, despite how personal it was, they told the place where I was trying to get unemployment from, that I never told them why I left. I would not recommend this place as a job, not even to my worst enemy."
bad,target is a great company to work in however I don't recommend anyone working at this location. if your willing to work here i want you to understand this is a place full of favoritism and HR is no help because they are baised. HR is very easily to manipulate by many leaders. every department has their pros and cons but DON'T WORK for logistics especially Backroom. The team lead in that department likes to harrass many female workers especially in beauty or softlines. This team leader has intimate relationships with his team members. however he makes sure that everyone in this store will be in his favor. Anything on camera he will make sure that Asset protection will delete any footage of him being intimate with certain team members. No one is allow to speak about this because he will threaten us by making our workload difficult. The corporate will try to investigate however he has a lot of people covering his tracks. This is a Warning if you do decide to work here and i hope this review will help you make a proper decision. and if you do decide to work here and encounter him please note that he will approach you in a friendly manner and will manipulate you to make it seem like he is a victim. he does this to everyone so that he can look like an angel and everyone else as a bad guy. please dont fall for his charms.
bad,"If you’re a great butt kisser then this is the job for you! "
bad,"I wanted to be able to work at target and say that I loved it, but I dreaded going into work. The people who worked there were not really that nice or welcoming."
bad,"It was a dump. I worked in the backroom and we would spend most morning completing autofills which are daily pulls needed for the replenishment of the store everyday. After that was done we'd have backstock from said pull which most of the time was our pulls resulting in waay more backstock than what shouldve been due to the confusion within the stores replenishment numbers/system. Whenever we finished our dedicated work (Backroom), Backroom team member would usually be called to assist other sections in their work due to them being literally useless and unable to complete their workload in a timely manner. Backroom team was the only section that had their workload completion timed by the way."
bad,"This multibillion dollar company is making record sales but cant afford employees. I was barely getting by on the few hours I had but they had recently cut my hours (and several other employees hours) back to 4 hours a week without explaination beforehand. When I tried to get any answers out of anyone I get gibberish spouted at me. I have never worked for a company that cared less about their employess and it is a company ran by bullies. They have no desire to show any sort of appreciation and when you go try and make things better they couldn't care less. When I  went to our HR guy explaining what was going on wrong in the softlines side I was told I was the problem for having ""too great of expectations."" Because expecting your employees to not stand around and gossip is too great an expectation"
bad,too much favortism at the target i was working at no hours for employees that arent friemds with the manager.overall very bad experience would not go back for anything
bad,Target treats Cashiers wrong. Mangt. needs more training. Can't move up as a cashier. Disrespectful and I will never work under such conditions. Don't be a cashier at Target!
bad,"I was a seasonal worker, and I thought I would be able to stay. The HR is rather rude and they do not know how to discuss anything important with their employees. I will never work there again."
bad,hours are only good in october and november the rest of the year you will only get 10-14 hours a week. This is a job that you have as a second job don't make it your main job. The GSA's are horrible all they do is sit around and talk. When you need help they have a  nasty attitude and then try to belittle you in front of customers. I'd give target as a whole 0 out of 5 stars.
bad,"The review summary states it all, GSAs are setting unreachable ground rules, while the hiring manager keeps hiring new team members while there is no hours to spare for the team members that has been working for the company for more than a year prior. Changes every week, hard to keep up while STL lacks leadership role and nags if something is done improperly. Favoritism is seen throughout the employer and GSAs and team members receiving less then 10 hours a week. Very disappointed, i highly do not recommend working for this company, well the store i work in particular."
bad,"no room to grow, management would rather have you stay low in their department rather than promote you to anything else just to reach their own goals."
bad,"unload the truck to right departments"
bad,Hated working there. I would not recommend working for this company. You are treated like a robot. Poor supervision and poorly ran shifts make it a difficult place to work.
bad,working here sucks the life right out of you. put me into a deep dpression.was so happy to get out of this store. it just drained me completely. management here was terrible
bad,"other workers willing to help when needed. Managers expect you to take care of problems that are their responsibility, and they get mad at you if you can't. They won't help you when you need help, and they tell you to hurry up because you're too slow. Most of the time the schedule isn't correct. Workers come in to work, and there's no place for them."
bad,"You can go from working 40 hours a week straight to 20 a week for months. Some have even gone a month with 0 hours. Management doesn't listen, talks down about how all employees are ""replaceable."" Verbally and physically abusive management that gets overlooked. Backroom is a fire hazard, death trap waiting to happen. Coworkers getting fired for calling out sick. Toxic work environment."
bad,"I really didn't enjoy working at the Target I worked at. I was told I would be given more hours, and hardly ever got any. Management and overall organization of expectations was low. It seemed that nobody on the management team were ever in sync on what needed to be done and had unreal expectations for a one person work crew."
bad,"Working at target was honestly terrible only thing good was that they cared about school and would give you an accommodation, but they where even starting to be hard on that. Management was terrible and always wanted you to do their work and they would get recognition for it and will coach you for god knows what. I was suppose to be full time but would sometimes only get 20 hours per week the closest I would get to ""full time"" was 30 hours. They kept hiring new people but wouldn't train them so it started to really be hard working there when no one knew what they were doing at all."
bad,"There is NOTHING that I learned at Target that I did not already know from my past working experience. Felt that the management were particularly hostile and unwilling to listen to employee's requests for more hours at work. Even volunteered to work Thanksgiving after a request went out from the floor manager for employees. I replied that I would gladly work if I was put on the schedule, but was not included on the schedule. Why ask me to work, and have no intention of including me on the work schedule?  I found this LAPSE my management very cruel and demeaning. Would not recommend working at Target to anyone serious about a career in retailing. It all revolves around the ""budget"" at Target."
bad,"Their motto is fitting:"
bad,"I worked at the Augusta, ME Target. The store manager played favorites and was rude to me no matter how hard I worked. I wasn't a fan of working for a corporate business anyway."
bad,"I was recommended by a friend to work at Target because they would be flexible with my availability, and needed someone with my experience. I interviewed and they loved me and hired me on the spot in a full time position. I signed on as a full time position in the holiday and everything was going fine, until one of the team leaders put me to this side and said I was too slow at stocking ( I ran a warehouse at Best buy, I know how to stock at a rapid speed) and then said if I wanted to advance past seasonal I need to work faster. I was shocked she called me seasonal when I was told by the GM I am a full time employee! I ignored her assuming she didn't know I was full time. Then, at the end of the holiday, they let me go because they were getting rid of their seasonal employees! I was lied to just so they could have a head count for the holidays! I quit a great paying job because I thought I had the security that would work with my availability! The Holland store in Toledo is an absolute joke and the staff are so two faced it isn't funny. I have worked management for a long time and I've never seen a company treat their employees like absolute terribly! If you want to work retail, I'd highly recommend Best Buy over this terrible company!"
bad,"Flow team was supposed to unload truck, stock, and bring back stock to the stock room for the backroom employees to handle. If you were cross-trained you could pick up extra hours and stay to do your own back stock if they were slammed. Target then implemented a new system where you have half the people on the unload line but expect the same unload time, then pull your section's pulls, stock new inventory with the pulls, then back stock you extra inventory. They wanted you to do three different jobs, quicker than your first job and all for the same amount of pay. I've worked at two different targets and had two wildly different management and employee morale experiences. it always depends on the store ETL who sets the tone, one was fantastic one was awful. If you get the job give it a week, youll probably know sooner than that if you want to stay."
bad,"They work you like a dog over there. Always calling on your day off to see if you can come in, have to plan time off a month in advance, and if you want to transfer to another position you literately have to claw your way out. Management is poor, especially when you have 12 different managers meddling in different departments.Funniest thing I ever say working there was a head manager of the building had to deal with an issue they should have dealt with, so she goes in the break room and 7 managers come stumbling out in about a minute, suddenly taking calls, giving us breaks, etc."
bad,"I've been with Target since I was 18, I'm 23 now, despite being semi- ""in charge"" of a team I'm treated like live never worked a day in my life. Pay is poor and hours are even worse. I can only recommend this company if you've never worked before or if you're desperate."
bad,"The managers do not care about the rest of the staff and expect unreasonable amounts of work from them. The sales associates are clicky, rude, mean , alcohol and drug addicted idiots."
bad,I worked here for about 6 months and was harassed by a manger in training and when I was going to write a report on it she fired me. Due to me still being new to their store she was able to do it no questions asked.
bad,"The ""right hand"" DOES NOT KNOW what the ""left hand"" is DOING AT ALL...!!!   "
bad,You are never really guaranteed hours and management will make up excuses why. You are and feel replaceable. Management will look the other way when there is a problem that needs to be addressed whether it is with team members or safety laws such as OSHA compliances.
bad,"A typical day at work at the Target store in the bronx riverdale location includes a lot of cleaning up, tidying up, and trying to assist large amounts of people all at once. The hours are distributed unfairly, you are judged unfairly, and no feedback is given unless asked for. Calling out sick can get you coached. The management is unprofessional at times. You can get yelled at for small talk at work but turn around and see all your managers doing just that. Some managers are even no where to be found. Need I say more?"
bad,"Hours are inconsistent, managers are all butt buddies with each other. There is no team work, just a lot of unnecessary stress to get stuff done with no help."
bad,"A typical day at Target consists of not being backed up by your manager, taking flak from some very rude walmart minded shoppers, follow Target best practice but executives make you look like a fool when they take the guest side."
bad,"Massive White supremacist problem. White supremacists stand behind you like they are physically going to grab/hurt you, grit they're teeth at you with their eyes popping out of their head to try and scare you, Even park next to you to do this.Amish security guard at the front security desk does this as well. Guy doing the orientation had crude sense of humor was making people uncomfortable. Said something about sending people ""back to where they came from"" Don't work here."
bad,"To be quite honest I absolutely hated working at Target, it was the worst job I have ever had due to team members harrassing, managers are unprofessional and it’s just a sloppy job all together."
bad,N/A at this time. Would rather not go into detail because I did not have the greatest Time while I was employed there. I don’t recommend anyone for the target I worked at
bad,"Although at first I was hired as a Seasonal Temp, I was hired on as part time. Management made for such a poor experience working here, I would not recommend this job to ANYONE."
bad,Long hours and company does not matter what is going on they do not care about their employee's. Zero work life balance and they do not care about family time.
bad,"Expectations were unrealistic.  Scheduling was TERRIBLE.  As a team lead, I had little input in my team schedule, planning/prioritizing. Too many cooks in the kitchen."
bad,"Target hires a type"
bad,Never worked the same hours they would keep you 3 to 4 hours after closing the store management had no sense of how to run a business in any way horrible company to work for
bad,Target is a great shopping experience but  when actually working there its awful. No one cares about anyones well-being and it was very stressful every shift with rude customers and leaders pressuring you. When I wanted to try moving up they never gave me the opportunity no matter how much work I did and how well I did it.
bad,"Target in Brier Creek is a terrible place to work, EXTREME favoritism, excusing people just standing around talking (favorites) managers standing around talking and getting mad at non favorites for talking for a minute. No benefits unless you get 40 hrs per week and you never get that, they make sure if it. Cutting your hours when you don’t comply with their “orders” (unnecessarily moving you around or they just don’t like you), you have absolutely no say in what time of day you work, doesnt matter if you have school or another job. They beg you to stay extra hours all the time but then make you leave early other days so you don’t get 40 hours a week. Overall a terrible place to work, at least the Brier Creek Target."
bad,Working a seasonal job you work about two days a week for about 4 hours a day and it is just not worth the time and effort unless you have a second job.
bad,"Target is a place that people leave because being there makes them want to die.  This is a serious problem and the reason I am leaving.  I have worked there over a year.  I have seen upper management call in for snow storms and incredible life threatening cold then come in the next day and write up everyone who called in for the same reason.  Recently they restructured so that the normal level team members are in charge of making sure that sales are met and that the store is clean.  They put all of their responsibility on the team and nw walks around with their hands in their pockets.  They do nothing and get bonuses when our departments that we work for make sales. They also promote the least experienced people.  I went through their ""leadership"" training and passed with flying colors yet when they promoted people on the floor to run departments they promoted all the new people they kept from seasonal instead of their experienced people.  Now keep in mind these promotions didn't come with any kind of pay raise just the responsibility.  There was no enjoyable part, but I did like the people there....except management"
bad,It used to be a fun place to work until they started the modernization bullcrap and now you are expected to do 100 things in one short shift.The management is also frustrating unless you kiss up.
bad,The store team lead and back room etl hired me into a full time team lead position the week before “black Friday”. I received no training except for being handed a PDT device or personal device and saying “this is how you backstock”. I was in a leadership position but was trained on the floor by  kind team members. The store team lead has absolutely no active role in the store. I never once saw her with a radio or my device in her hand. I spoke to her a couple of times while she showed pictures of her dog and talked about television shows at the TSC. The backroom ETL would work hours in the middle of the night. I would see that he had pulled product from the backroom at 4:30am in the morning. I was asked to sit in an office behind a close door while ETL’s 2 at a time would gang up on me and tell me how horrible i was and that I wasn’t a good fit for the job. They do not recycle at all they have no respect for the environment or anyone at all. The work environment was one of the most abusive workplace environment i have been in. The store run’s it’s self because it’s on the University of Massachusetts campus. The STL and the backroom ETL do not work at all. There are employees that have been working there for many years with out pay increases or job placement advancement. They do not promote within.  They do not offer any training unless it is mandated training and they even fall behind on that. They throw thousands of dollar worth of merchandise into the “compactor” trash machine because they did not mark the prices down and sell the items as clearance.
bad,"They really didn't train me. I was never taught how to request days off for appointments, I wasn't even taught how to request money at the register until my 4th week. I didn't get my computer training until the last day of my 2 weeks of training. Emotionally, the ride on being abusive to their workers. The GSTLS often leave the front end unattended and don't answer the walkies so no one gets any help. They don't tell you things you need to know until after you mess up so that they can yell at you for it. They care more about REDcards than they care about their employees. A lot of my co-workers went into meal compliance because we wouldn't get our breaks on time. The registers are never open and the entire first half of the day is self-checkout only, which makes a lot of our customers mad and they leave. If you ever go to anyone to complain about an issue, they bring up REDcards. It's disrespectful. I told them that I had autism and they decided to fire me shortly after. After I started working there my mental health suffered greatly and I had MULTIPLE breakdowns on the job from the stress and disrespect. They will yell at you for THEIR mistakes IN FRONT of customers. I've had shifts where I was supposed to get off at a certain time and didn't get off until 30 minutes after because the GSTL didn't even know or keep track of my or anyone else's schedules and didn't have anyone to cover me and didn't know I was supposed to get off. They've also done the same thing by just ignoring their responsibilities and walking away from the front end, talking to other co-workers, and not answering"
bad,not supportive of student employees they made very hard for me to go to school. i felt as i had to chose between school & work. other than that management really didn't support the department
bad,target is unfair to the people that work for them. They will fire you for something you did not even do with out even looking into it first. do not work for them
bad,Comfortable working conditions in a very fast paced environment that can be very stressful with very demanding rude customers and very poor pay for all the hard work that employees do.
bad,I worked in the food court and management sucks and doesn’t care about you. Your hours would be less than 20 most weeks. The only good thing would be the $12.50 an hour.
bad,"Horrible place to work.  They do not take into account how many hours you say you want per week and they schedule for more than what you want.  They accuse you of things that were never done.  they say they have you on film, but when you ask to see it, they refuse to show you.  very awful place to work!"
bad,Targets first goal is to get the work done no matter the circumstances. It was stressful and busy. Because of that environment it shaped me to become the worker I am now.
bad,Target is definitely not a place to work at . The management is one sided and they will take their word over the employee. They will let you go when they feel like it . Your walking on pins and needles there. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless u want it for seasonal and that sucks too. Don't work there.and if you have medical problem they will not accept  work excuses or anything unless it's throughout a third party. At the end of the day. Management at this location would just stomp on you. And keep going. Good luck
bad,"Too many Spanish speakers trying to take over jobs. If you don’t speak Spanish, co workers mistreat you. "
bad,"The managers specially LYN, makes our job a living trash. They really suck here. The mangers besides 2 of the mangers. The hours suck. This job is really a joke. They have favoritism"
bad,"Job seems like it would be somewhere you would want to work. Don't fall for their talk. Management sucks, nobody knows what is going on. Managers can not agree on same thing."
bad,"While Target boasts it's the best department store to work at, the corporate culture still infects the work environment. The managers do not care about the employees as people, instead going to great lengths to avoid giving people benefits or paying overtime. The work was your typical customer service job."
bad,"• Took care of customers that needed help "
bad,I did not like working for this company so much that i forbid even buying anything from this company since leaving. The layoff process was horrible and i couldnt imagine anyone knowing what to expect from them
bad,"Worked at the target in Pleasant Prarie WI, Don't try to defend yourself or your fellow team members to the STL you'll end up getting fired. He will find even the smallest reason and let you go. He is the type of person who is not afraid to step on everyone below him to advance his career. He's also not afraid to say something disrespectful to you while on the sales floor."
bad,"I did not enjoy working there. The management was poorly done, and training was seriously lacking. In not recommend anyone work or shop there. The way they treat their employees is subhuman."
bad,"""Work somewhere you love"" .... Yeah right lol. "
bad,"1. When I worked 40 hours I didn't get paid the 40 hours"
bad,Management  expect way too much of you .  The store would run a lot better with better management.  GSA isn’t the role you want to be in...  you do all the work as a team lead but get paid as a team member.
bad,worst place ever to work. I wouldn't suggest anyone to work there. bad work environment. the  pay is good but they will give out less hours for new employees.
bad,Having the hours that you needed for a part time employee was a very difficult thing to get. Had to jump through extra hoops just to get the hours needed
bad,The management team does not provide employees with enough time or help to properly complete tasks. A lot of things are left undone and the staff as well as management are rude.
bad,"Hostile work environment. Lack of communication from management. "
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend to anyone , no hours, poor working conditions, unders staffed, no room for advancement, rude unprofessional management team! Stressful"
bad,"The job itself is easy however the management cuts hours from employees who have been there for a long time to give them to seasonal employees. They tell their employees ""hours will go back up"" for months while they continue to decrease. They schedule their employees less than 20 hours a week yet tell them they won't accommodate a second job's schedule making it impossible for employees to make living,"
bad,"Worked at Target 4 years , 3 different managers.Everthing went from bad to worse. Don't care about safety, no proper training. I went from working 33 to 38 hrs a week closing every night to 4 hrs a week , and closing just 1 day a week. Everyone playing and talking and texting on phone's and not working. I suffered amild heart attack at work, i told the manager i needed to leave, I drove to a care clinic and was sent to the hospital for 2 days. After returning to work. I was demoted and transfered to another department. I was written up and will be on probation for 1 year. No raises, and no transfers for 1 year, this was for not calling in sick while I was in the hospital.Now im stuck with working 1 day a week and a 25,000 dollar hostlpital bill !"
bad,"I was an intel for them , I thought telling my supervisors were mature enough to keep all internal exposures among themselves. I was told I would never be exposed but that was a lie.A couple of days go by and I got to work and it was discovered my identity was exposed and over heard what was going to be plotted against me for exposing my coworker. My supervisors subjected me to danger and after I was concerned for my life I had to leave ASAP."
bad,No hours and the management is bad. They do not help the worker with the management. Also the demands that are ask are unreasonable. There is no real future working for target.
bad,"Target is not a good place to work.  Management is terrible and those who are promoted are not qualified to be managers.  Hours are terrible and are cut in order to help upper management make money, not team members."
bad,"Friendly coworkers but the managers take advantage of employees, they hire huge amount of workers for seasonal positions and overwork them and have them compete with each other but you don't benefit from them. I was under constant stress of trying to impress my supervisors but will easily forgot your talent with minor mistakes. They rather highlight mistakes than achievements. Makes a person feel really guilty at the end of the day."
bad,"Was told I'd be hired part time and given 25+ hours a week but that was a lie, was never asked to work and was always being told many different lies by workers."
bad,"Manager play favorites."
bad,the supervisor has a poor attitude and does not have proper people skills and them and reprimand  workers in front of customers on the sale floor and belittle  the employee for everyone to see who is the insight of it on the sale floor
bad,Not a bad place to work depending on the leadership.  Enjoyed my time there until management changed.  When that happened it was the worst place i ever worked.
bad,Unfair treatment by management. Incredible amounts of favoritism at the Hunters creek Florida location. Would never recommend anyone attempt to apply.
bad,"Customer service on where products were placed. Check out customer at cash register. Handle calls, screen job application, set up job interviews, directed job orientations."
bad,"There is no advancement, I know cuz I worked for this company over a decade, they lead you on and get you to think that you have hope of moving up, instead they always go with outside sources and hire someone who has never worked for Target and no training at all. Work life balance is a joke, you get more life and less work, they cut your hours so bad that you have no work  / life balance. The leadership in this store (# T0164 Casper Wy) is not good. They do not care about you as a person, they only care about what you can do for them. They do play favorites in this store, you do notice favouritism in this store, it's bad. I would recommend anyone who is considering applying for this company, DON'T, they are not worth the time, they allow harassment and will not do anything about it, its very frustrating that this company allows it, their employee handbook states that it is not tolerable, but really in all reality, they do not care. Please, stay away from Target, they will only make you miserable, again I know, i just recently had to walk away after 11 years, it is a toxic environment and you really can do better. I already found something so much better than this company."
bad,missing my working hours without pay me and tried to contact to the store manager and human resource more than ten times and they all had excuses to avoid or contact me back ever.
bad,"During orientation, Target seemed huge on being a place you feel comfortable and welcomed. I’ve never been more unhappy with management and how they treat their employees. Employees are not heard when an issue occurs, they only care about the money their making. Horrible place to work. They work the baristas alone 98% of the time. I’m sure other Target stores are perfectly fine but Target 1406 in Fairview, OR. is NOT the place to work."
bad,"Had my interview around mid November of 2018 then was told I had to wait on my background check to come back which would take 2-5 days. & they would call me back .long story short I had to ended calling them numerous times because December was approaching and I was told in the interview I had the job. Finally on dec 2 2018 I had orientation and my schedule. In my interview I was hired for beauty team. Member I was told they would match my pay from my previous job because of my experience, which was totally fine. I was hired for seasonal but was asked by management how many hours I would like to work and I told them full time because I had open availability. The manager who interviewed me stated that all the shifts rotated between all the associates in that area, the same ppl don’t close or open everyday . THAT WAS A LIE!!!!!!! Then as I started working I noticed that I was only scheduled 2 days out the week with only 7.5 hours  or less each day so technically I was making no money because I wasn’t getting any hours. Then I found out it was a total of 6 beauty team members including myself , so I figured that’s why I wasn’t getting any hours but I wish I was told that In the interview because I would’ve preferred another position. Hours, now let’s talk about those, I would get scheduled 6-7 sometimes 7.5 hours but not in my actual area. My first week I had early shifts where I was working with the logistics team and working in other departments in the store. But once I got back to my area I was scheduled closing and maybe one mid shift but only 2 days out the week! (What am I"
bad,"There for about.3 years. I was the jack of all trades, had to learn everything. The managers and ream leaders were always on your back. No recognition unless u kiss butt. . The ones that worked hard. Always seemed to get more yelled at. , than the ones roaming around the store...never enough.staff. childish ."
bad,"My store in particular, was run by incompetent bullies who took out their frustrations on younger team members, due to us being understaffed, the work load was unbalanced and unrealistic. Managers walk, talk and shop, throughout the work day to themselves, but disapprove of team members working together to complete task together."
bad,I worked 4 in the morning till 8 in the morning unloading trucks and loading trucks at a very fast paced work environment.it was a seasonal job and once again I received a job without asking me about my life story on a computer
bad,"but they kill you with too much work and less time , the team lead was not nice .I was there early in the morning and unloading the truck was heavy and later i had to stock the items in the shelf and do all that in just 4 to 5 hours .. too heavy"
bad,I had some of the most unprofessional managers or leads. They were rude. Never really were cared about their employees. They were rude. The put anyone in a position to be a manager.
bad,i really dont feel its necessary to criticize my former employers in any way i am just motivated to find a new job and getting back to work to make money.
bad,"working at target is a experience ill never forget! The LOD’s are awful!!!!! rude, no greeting, no  acknowledgement of good work. i worked for the remodel crew for 13 weeks it was hard and not together as far as plans and work load  . the LOD’s in charge was messy and very personal with one another. they choose there favorites and picked on the ones they didnt like, alot of the remodel team member employees experience target as there first job, the hiring LOD brought in young kids with no work history and verbaly whipped them as they worked with her attitude and  Personality. (very mean) the contractors were dealing with managment outside of the work area and it Interfered with work ethics deeply. by the end of the 13th week many have quit due to the  unprofessionalism and  favouritism. storemanager was informed of the issues... nothing happened!! the employees they kept after the remodel left us in awh.... they didnt deserve the position and they were the LOD’s favorite. giving the Opportunity for a perm position i declined.  the managment is too Conniving and self centred. they really dont care about you just how hard and fast you work."
bad,"Whe i First started working at target, it was a good place to work and i loved it the management took care of it s team member Raises were according to how hard you work. it started going down hill now the company doesn't care about its team member anymore. they give the hours and promotion to the people that don't have the knowledge of what they are doing, then they put people on upper management that have barely graduate from a university and don't have any knowledge on how the store operates, i know people that have better work ethics than this people."
bad,Managers genuinely don't care or know anything about their jobs or their employees. I worked there for over a year and the GM never learned my name or even bothered to despite the fact I wore a name tag. A complete joke of a company and management was the worst I've ever seen which is saying something since I've worked at Sears before.
bad,"target is not a very friendly place to work. no flexibility, no overtime, no place for advancement. management is terrible, you end up doing double work."
bad,"Most of the managers are rude, bossy, unwilling to listen to the employees, and plain suck at their jobs. Too many of them seem to fancy themselves as dictators or Gods. We had some good managers, but they would leave very quickly once they realized what a heck hole they were working in. Morale is extremely low and many of the employees hated their jobs with a burning passion. I hated working there, but at least I could pay my rent."
bad,"Management is the worst, they will hire a person off the street with no work experience ever to manage an entire store or department rather than promote from within the company with actual qualifications. You receive zero benefits working here. They will schedule you on days you are not available and tell you its mandatory that you come in despite not offering any full-time job employment. If you get close to 40 hours they will send you home regardless of your schedule and amount of work needed to be done. Backroom does not meet safety regulations due to excessive amount of clutter and piled up workloads. Some days mandatory breaks were not granted."
bad,target screwed me over. big time. i was was offered a job with 30 hours and worked about a month in before they said they made a mistake and needed to change my position to which i said okay to but ended up working 8 hours or less a week and was giving very poor training.F- target. bye
bad,"The management team are cutthroat horrible spineless people, they discriminate, if there mouths are open they’re lying and note this, I’ve worked at about 4 targets. I helped open one I moved twice and they’re all the same. If you’re management and a good person don’t expect to last long, only work at target if you like wasting your life and you like being degraded (all facts)."
bad,"Not enough Hours for me , The management members were very Lazy and were depending on the employees to do everything. The hardest part was transitioning into a fast paced setting. The enjoyable part was helping the customers as best as I could."
bad,"I hear they pay $12/hr now. But that's only because they have to. I made $12/hr because I wouldn't work for anything less. They don't truly care about their employees. If the store isn't making money they cut hours that same day, I know it's retail and that's how it works, but this is a huge corporation."
bad,"My team and I always got our jobs done while stocking the floor, helping our customers find what they needed. We got along great and had fun while we worked."
bad,"micro managed from day one ,  terrible training and then yelled at when i didn't know what i was doing ...  thank god i'll never have to work at a place like this ever again"
bad,I am giving you a fair warning. DO NOT DO IT. Don’t even apply. The hours are trash. They expect so much of you & barely pay you anything. You have to train yourself & teach yourself how to do the job. You have no opportunity to advance in the company. To pay for you benefits(healthcare etc) its more than what your paycheck is. Management is not helpful. They have made it clear that the sales people need to work hard so we can line their pockets. It is absolutely ridiculous. I say all this & I actually am in one of the good stores.(not putting the store or state i actually work in)
bad,"My job description was Backroom Stocker and i was rarely given assistance. After i was able to show my efficiency in working, I was then demanded to handle online orders, stock shelves,  and unload the truck almost single handed, yet if I fell behind, management would have no problem degrading me into working harder to meet their goals."
bad,"its a trap you  get treated like garbage after working for 6 years, its not worth the time or eneergy to go in and get treated like garbage. look else where you are better off."
bad,The manager juana is very rude and unprofessional . She doesn’t communicate well as said very mean hateful things. She doesnt care about employees only herself
bad,"This is an okay job for someone starting in the job market to get experience. Pay sucks, schedule sucks, the people were okay didn't know many of them."
bad,"dealing with customers at the cash registers , and stocking items with other team members, manage money at the registers. assist customers with items if they need help find items also match prices if different than ad prices shows online"
bad,Wouldnt wish this job on my worst enemy. They make up rules as they go. Youre expected to work while sick. You get blamed for things out of your control. All around a terrible place to be.
bad,"their policy is to treat each other like family and they have an ""open door policy"". they also tell you that they are willing to work with you in any situation. all of this I found out to be a lie when I got pregnant. I told them that the bending was hurting my pregnancy and requested to work at the registers for the time being. rather than helping me, they compared me to someone else working in the store who was pregnant also and told me that since she was ok they would not help and that it would be best for me to leave if the pregnancy was so bad... smh. poor job target...smh"
bad,"Very stressful, no communication and nothing is properly taught. Management does not care about its employees, and the environment is very cliquey. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the other employees, and the most enjoyable part is going home."
bad,I was fired for being nine minutes late. I was walked to the door and told Good Luck. I have Never been fired from a job in my life.I would not recommend this job for anyone.This will remain on work career forever. I was hired for seasonal help.The Grinch really stole my Christmas.
bad,"at first I loved this job then was harassed by management and cornered in the buckram and when I got lined her they did nothing to help me so I put my 2 weeks in and was harassed again and told to change my statement. do not recommend working here,"
bad,"Management was disgustingly unprofessional, always rude, liars, selfish, talks about secrets employees told them to others, worst management in a store I’ve ever seen. I was a supervisor and 1/2 the store was part time and making more hourly than me. -20/10 would NEVER recommend working for the Target in Rogers Arkansas!!"
bad,"The people at store do not seem to care about anyone.    No training lack of anything to explain thing like their phones and other devices they use. All I ever heard was you will learn this stuff in time .  sure you will but should would be nice for someone to explain  things so you would know how to use right away and have in writing how to use things so you would have a reference to look up if needed,  kind of like throwing a curve ball, nice to know how to do it so you can learn how to throw it."
bad,"Never provided enough hours, or was either always told leave early cause of slow production and the supervisors didn’t seem to care bout anything unless it benefited them work wise."
bad,"You do not get many hours so do not expect it. Part time at target is two days a week, a total of eight hours. They do not care about personal life or hours you receive. Very strict. and not caring"
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for in my life. They have no system. they have no platform policies that they follow. I harassed daily. Their policies and rules always changed to each predicament. never had any paper work for any corrective actions. overall this was the worst company I have ever worked for.
bad,"Target terminated me and did not provide me with a reason. They said that I wasnt meeting their expectations. The manager is a gay piece of dirt. The employees in softlines are completely stank ! They want their employees to be perfect and there is no such thing, that is why they are always hiring. Do not apply to work there and do not shop there !"
bad,I am not sure if all Target's are like this but the one I worked at did not care at all if you were in high school or college. They constantly scheduled everyone out of how many hours they wanted weekly because they are understaffed but are ok with over working their employees. They get mad when you want to leave at 10:30 at night when you want to go home and finish homework. Team leads are very good at talking bad about their team members to other team members.
bad,Not a good place to work. Low moral and emplyees are over worked for the pay. They will hire too many people then start letting the new hires go.  All in all a bad experience.
bad,"I was told i would have a trainer for a week with busy hoilday doing flex fullfillment i got 1 hour with laura who was the only DECENT PERSON WHO WORKS THERE than told your on your own ,i asked to be moved to cashier was told no with attitude all supervisor and hr are super RUDE or at least mine are ,only being there a week and making one small mistake i was yelled at there backroom stock areas are VERY MESSY HARD TO EVEN GET YOUR PRODUCT THAN THERE LADDERS ARE A DEATH TRAP THAT CREAK AND DANGEROUS THEY SAY OH WELL USE IT ANYWAYS YOU WILL DO SO MUCH WORK FOR SO LITTLE PAY YOUR BETTER OFF WORKING AT MCDONALD'S THAN TARGET OR AT LEAST TARGET ON PILOT KNOB IN APPLE VALLEY."
bad,Fast paced environment. Put stock on the floor quickly. No time to check dates. No time to merchandise. Supervisors constantly yelling to hurry up. The time limit is more important to get the stock on the floor is more important than doing the job right.
bad,"fun place to work, room for advancement, great managers, team member were great, fun culture, great benefits, there is favoritism, employee engagement, schedule out a month ahead"
bad,This was one of the worst places i have ever worked.  VERY poor management and ethics.  They use you and waste your time in training.  Management was the worst i have ever worked.
bad,They drove you into the ground with the work they expected in the short amount of time they scheduled you for. No manager would help even if you asked for it.
bad,"Now you have to go through a lot to get in target to get no benefits no hours or days but call you on holidays. I always called for hours if someone called out, and volunteered but they didn't even acknowledge it. Plus I passed out while pregnant because they wouldn't let me sit down nor go home. I was in the hospital they called and asked was I coming back to work the same day! Like Target management needs to be replaced the whole team!"
bad,I feel as if Target is a retail place then we could have more flexible then we have then more pay for the cost of living that we have to live now. Its a okay job if your coming out of high school or in college and need a income  then I would say work at Target.
bad,Will get disrespected and fired if job is not done within due time of the management. Even without proper training you will get disrespected and seen as a slacker cause your not able to do it quickly
bad,management sucks. no  communication over work  not enough pay. expect you to finish stocking before your end of shift. cut your hours of work or make you over work and not appreciative of what you do for the store.
bad,Place was horrible place to work and never got many hours and when  body asked for more hours they denied having extra hours and they treat people horrible
bad,wasted 8 years of my life at this place. it was a decent job at first but managers are horrible and constantly changing. they arent honest with you upfront.
bad,"my location was not a great one and i was in the Optical department  they have nothing to do with Target  seperate company inside "
bad,it was a nice company to work for it is to bad they did not stay in Canada they had great hours with great staff  I did the liquidation for the company it was fun and informative
bad,If a manager expects me to be available at scheduled time than I expect the same. It is unacceptable to delay an interview over anhour without notice.
bad,"management is horrible. young and inexperienced, had no work life balance, always new rules and regulations  enforced every two weeks. can never keep a staffed store"
bad,This place sucks. Everyone wants to stack their work load on you. Management is a complete joke. The pay is garbage and the hours are lacking and unreliable.
bad,"Great place to shop but not a great place to work! They don't give enough hours, they get on you even if you're staying late to make sure the job is done correctly, the pay rate is low, and management consist of people who abuse their authority"
bad,"Why does it matter? Even if I loved it here, its not like you can contact them about it. Cool place to work. nice people. Closed down three years ago."
bad,it was a jobThis Target doesn't have a Target feel to me. The layout differs from many others (and makes zero sense) which makes it more difficult on newer shoppers. I like uniformity. Last year I came here on Black Friday to get a movie my son loves. Walmart and other stores have their displays in a place that makes no sense or is large enough to catch your eye. This Target? Not so much. I found the movie on a quite small display standing by its lonesome next to the shampoo. I try to make sense of this store I just cant. On the bright side their customer service employees are quick and friendly. Prices are higher than walmart obviously but the environment is nicer and quality is apparent   it was ok
bad,"managers expect you to do a 4 person job with little help and expected you to finish by closing time. I felt excluded from other workers, I just didn't feel welcomed"
bad,"I was fired for being too happy. My happiness showed my co-workers, management and more importantly the customers how unhappy the others were. Not to say there weren't others who were happy, just most of them were not and it showed when they complained about my happiness and the fact that customers would pass them up to come to my counter instead."
bad,"The target that I currently work at is alright but they need to get new etls and lods because some of them just sit on their butts and do nothing and yell at random employees for stupid little things. I was inadequately trained and then the etls and lod would be mad at me for something that I was not trained on. They throw you in random places you don't know and expect you to learn everything right from the start. Plus also they get mad when you are over your time and have to pay you time and half because I did it like twice and they are kind of cocky now. I feel as a whole target should get rid of all the employees they have (not the nice ones) and start fresh because these people pick favorites and you can tell. I have came from a place that did that and I know what it feels and looks like. Plus they also leave things in the fire hall easily that could be a fine in itself.  Plus they never advertised online that it was for seasonal help they only advertised at the store. They should correctly advertise the jobs online so that way the prospective employees know whether or not it is seasonal or an actual position.  Plus also they do not like when people call off for anything and I also put three weeks in advance for a day off and they basically go ""Nope sorry can't do that"" and schedule me anyways."
bad,"Horrible place to work, cold in winter, hot in summer. try to fire you for anything. junk equipment. cannot make your pick rate. supervisors show favoritism towards employees. a lot of nasty people. very, very unsafe place to work. you are just a number. they make you work all holidays. a lot of walking to breaks, cannot drive equipment there. cutthroat management and employees. go on welfare before you work there!!!!!"
bad,Every day is a stressful day no one ever does anything right. Managers are really clueless. Hours are horrible and calling out because you're sick they cut your hours for the following week.
bad,management was absolutely the worst team i have ever witnessed. revolving door of incompetent workers who were just there to stand and collect a pay check
bad,I now have a misdemeanor theft. So I don't like them there. I don't even shop there anymore! It was the worst experience of my life. And I'm not the only one who had to go threw it!
bad,This is the type of place you go above and beyond for and yyou get treated unfairly. Managers do not listen to your side they are quick to write you up so they have a reason to fire you
bad,"controlling Job.They dont care anyone but there little circle of"
bad,"I worked at Target for four years. I didn't enjoy it at all. I had moments with great managers and moments with terrible managers. The terrible managers were more consistent than the good ones. There was a racist team lead that I seemed to work with all the time. He was awful. I felt very undervalued as an employee. I did my best, I worked hard, and I was a great team player but that didn't reflect when it was time for raises. We didn't get bonuses. Your pay was based on hours work. I worked almost everyday of the week and still couldn't make $300. Terrible. I was working for pennies but my caliber of work was above and beyond that. So I wouldn't recommend working for this company at all. Do your research and don't believe the hype. The company is built on the backs of the Sales Associates but the Executives get all the benefits. Not cool! Bad Company."
bad,Management team was not fair with work load. Would not help. They got paid all the money and all they did was drink coffee and smoke. It was not a team at all there.
bad,"Working at target was super stressful. team member were rude, they will make sure they pass you just to not speak. they over work you. and management is terrible"
bad,"No room for advancement unless you suck up. They make the best workers work like crazy with no help. They make promises of promotion to keep you there and working hard, but they never follow through. Instead they hire from outside the store. They keep management that does little to no work, and leave the hard workers at the bottom. Yet they tell you that you have to work harder than them to be them. It never made any sense. It didn't matter that you never call off, or you are never late, or how hard you work, or how many hours you put in, or how many departments you learned and worked. It was never enough. It's bad when you as a regular employee know more about every single department and employee than your store manager does. Not a good environment at all."
bad,Training was minimal. It became evident that temporary was just that. There is absolutely no chance for retention. Most of the permanent workers were related in one way or another. The expectations of the new workers were higher than the permanent workers as far as productivity and promoting target red cards. Did not even know who was who as far as management. No one introduced themselves or wore name tags.
bad,The store management treats the employees like machines instead of people  the hours are inconsistent and the work expected is ridiculous especially the time limits to unload 2 pallets a day by yourself
bad,It sucked when i worked there. Very poor management. Hardly given any raises. Every so overacting. not a very friendly environment. too much discrimination.and so on
bad,Will say they support you...but they don't the jus want to ring as much$$ out as they can before you die. then you will just work you and work you to death
bad,A typical day consisted of warehouse work. I learned inbound/outbound job responsibilities. The management was okay. The workplace was stressful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of team work. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling that I accomplished my job at the end of the day.
bad,When i first started i thought it was going to be something good well the management team prove me so wrong they only worry about themselves. Management worry about their bonuses only.
bad,"When I first worked at the 2204 store, it was amazing! Had an amazing boss, relaxed and fair. My team leaders were amazing. When my team leaders left and we got a new boss and new team leaders, it all went to heck."
bad,Don’t work here. They are cold and only care about Redcards. It’s almost impossible to advance here. They only hire in. Management won’t even remember your name.
bad,Target lacked the proper supplies for me to correctly do my job. I was in a freezer with no company gloves. I was expected to do 2 hours worth of work in 30 min. I was lifting items over 3 times my weight.
bad,Target was a horrible place to work. Team members had reduced hours but were expected to work harder with no additional pay. People often filled management roles but not receive additional pay to do so. The company expressed their desire to promote within and build their team members but never followed through on any promises.
bad,The company doesn't know how to differentiate a visual merchandiser and a regular team member.  they want you to do all of the same work and you cant get your job done.  They changed hours on me from what initially was promised on hiring.  They cut hours all the time and make you work holidays.
bad,"Terrible management, terrible pay and terrible hours, very much competitive and favoritism based. If you are a management favorite then you can get a better position."
bad,"terrible company. It does not treat employees fairly, discriminates, does not comply with laws, etc. I was discriminated by this company, and this company does not comply with family leave."
bad,"I would not recommend anyone work at Target, you don'g get 40 per week. promotions are based on wether you are popular or not. I only get between 8 and 15 hours per week."
bad,"Having to come in at for in the morning, or worse, midnight was an awful experience. For the pay it was an utterly terrible time that tolled on my mental health and overall wellbeing."
bad,"Took the job right out of college, and I was excited to work in a company that ""valued"" my abilities. I was pleasantly surprised how different the organization was after I began to work for Target. I was not properly trained to do my position, so I was setup for failure. I had a terrible manager that played favorites, and would single you out if you weren't apart of her ""group"". I'm not here to bash Target, many of the stores have great teams and cultures. I just wouldn't recommend a friend or family member to work at Target based on my working experience."
bad,"Worked overnight. Considered first shift so pay was minimum wage (7.50 at that time) and as soon as the stock was placed on the floors and moved to shelves, you were asked to leave and not complete an 8 hour shift."
bad,This job is for young people who just need money until they reach their career goals. Unless you’re willing to lose all your morales and backstab your coworkers you will never advance. Management takes credit for everything the sales people do
bad,My suggestion is don't work for target if your looking for a career. If you work for target get out. You can tell wen target is going to fire you. your hours and workload go up your payroll goes down and is given to other departments.
bad,"they will let you work in a position for months without being properly compensated for it and then when the promotion becomes available and you apply they decide to close the position to current employees and hire someone from outside to take the position you have been working in ""until the job position becomes available""."
bad,"Stupid company, obnoxious employees. Dumb products, pointless shoppers. Everything about the company is absolute garbage tbh. I DO NOT recommend working here."
bad,"Target's ""Ban the Box"" movement is nothing but a farce! Target does not really care about ex-offenders! Target only cares about good PR, and making themselves look good! Shame on Target!"
bad,"Target is an amazing place to shop at... if you like clutter and chaos. It's also an amazing place to work... if you like being underpaid and mistreated.  When I first started working at target, I didn't mind the inconsistent hours and the management, but once I brought up an issue about one of the team members being overly harsh and condescending for problems and issues that weren't at fault of the employees, I began to get more mistreatment than before. I have never worked a job that I hated so much before I worked there and the only reason why I stayed was because I needed the money. I don't shop at target anymore and I wouldn't recommend working there to anyone unless you've never worked a day in your life and you desperately need money. If you have any job experience at all, try and find a job elsewhere. Target won't get you any further than your last job."
bad,"A lot of standing on feet, constantly micromanaged, not fun and customer complaints constantly, glad to be done working there and will never go back, not even to shops"
bad,Target would have you believe otherwise but they are in the shadows of another major retailer even though they say they don't compete .Target is a cutthroat place that dose not have to be that way .I worked for a woman who had former training in the military and still was trying to prove herself to somebody .She had a low tolerance and a bias  opinion of men which she exhibited everyday.They bring people on during the holidays and then find reasons to get rid of them after that.
bad,"Worst place i have ever worked in my entire life. They pretend to care about your needs but it is all fake. They continue to tell us that we are high performing store one of the best but cut hours of the ones who work the hardest, the early morning crew, to line their pockets with more money at the end of the yr. They treat some employees better but treat others like worthless garbage. They are not open to suggestions , which would benefit not only the store but the employees. They also don’t care about continuously changing people’s schedule even though they were hired to work a specific time frame and messes with other obligations. When it is brought to their attention they say “you signed up for this”, but when you ask for more hours they say, “you signed up for a specific number of hrs”. They treat everyone as if they are uneducated. And seem to only care about making the place look nice or treat us semi well when there is a visit."
bad,The people were great and the hours were great but then the hours got worse and it was just not fun to work there anymore. They favor people more then others
bad,"Pays minimum wage and don’t expect a raise until they are legally made to raise it. Always feel like you’re easily replaceable because you are. Managers are always on the move and don’t have enough tome to hear your problems. Won’t give you overtime, very strict on rime clocks. 1/10"
bad,Very poor management.dont plan ever to stay there for along time...way to much favoritism.if you don't have the piercings.the dyed hair.the young looks .you can forget about ever getting promoted...awful awful place.they want the young fresh blood all the time there.oh and if are not fit enough for security gurads and look good they wont talk to you.they will ignore you...never work for this awful place
bad,"Target was horrible for me. It was fine when I was part time and a cashier working maximum of 30 hours a week. But as a full time employee, they work you to the bone. They pile on the projects and expect you to not only finish that in one shift, but also take care of the daily tasks and waiting on guests hand and foot, not just telling people where things are but walking them there, making sure they get a discount, and you BETTER SELL THAT REDCARD. Target is stressed with the pressure of Amazon and the convenience of online shopping and their solution is to weigh down and seperate their employees while the executive employees get to delegate and work in teams. Unless you are working very part time, do not work for Target."
bad,it had ants and was very unsanitasy and overtime the managers alway shave attitude and all in all its jus super stressful but i dealt with it for a while but i jus got sick of it
bad,"Target has poor management and need to become more organized "
bad,"Wasn't getting paid enough hourly, hours weren't as flexible and I didn't have the option of relocating neither did I get a raise for the year I was working there. However there was a group of sale managers who would gather us sales floor associates to volunteer at a few places and that was an alright experience."
bad,Started a new unload process. Can never get anything done. Backrooms are a mess. Hardest working team members still dont get recognition for everything they do. Will not recieve a raise when asking for it. They dont care about your mental health.
bad,I didn't like this job the managers and supervisors were mean and they were very inconsiderate of peoples life outside of work.They scheduled the associates odd hours and they didn't notify people of schedule changes.
bad,"My typical day at Target was horrible, tedious, and lack of management. It was essentially a fend for yourself situation. Guest were always right and were allowed to demean you, if they pleased."
bad,"working here sucked, management was awful, retail is awful, hours sucked, no work life balance, yet i was there for 10 years. my peers made it possible."
bad,"Hours weren't the best, not much room to move up. They don't think twice about cutting hours. Not a friendly place to work, I always felt like it would be from shopping there."
bad,Es muy poco pago para mucho trabajo es muy pesado y pocas horas
bad,"Would not recommend hours always being cut, unfair management it was the worst. You get started at 12 but barely get hours to make ends meat anyone looking for advancement they will not give you the position unless your the favorite."
bad,"Was one of the only cashiers trained on guest services and food ave. Always got attitude from managers, was always the only cashier that was working. They REFUSED to give me full time hours."
bad,Target is a terrible place to work. They never want to give you a raise even if you've been there for a long time. They never want to promote or train anyone for advancement and there is a lack of respect for anyone who isn't in management.
bad,"Don't listen"
bad,"Management was not good at all, they are not very helpful to the workers but they are helpful to the customers.  I would ask for more hours over and over, because 9 hours a week was not enough, but they always ignored me."
bad,"My four interviews lead me to believe I was going to get 35-38 hrs a week, averaged 25. There was no hope of getting more unless you were a lead. Most of the people there were in their 20's to early 30's."
bad,"You feel like family when u work there for a long time, a nice place to work. Red cards were hard to get but u get prizes sometimes if u get 1 or more."
bad,Managers don’t know how to manage. They don’t respect your availability. I told them I can’t work on Sunday night because I have school at 9AM in the city and they scheduled me for a 10 hour closing shift on Sunday. They have a terrible work environment everyone is sad and stressed.
bad,Everyone who works there is an absolute jerk. they slapped me around after work like I was some kind of pinata. they even ate my potato salad I had been saving for 3 months. disgusting
bad,I’ve worked for target for 3 years. I was promised a promotion about 6 months after I started to no avail. I worked at one of the Coon rapids locations and it was pure agony. All management lacked basic communication and didn’t know how to train their team. They rarely take issues seriously and treat everyone very unfairly. I would never ever recommend working for this target.
bad,"Poor management, poor wages, random hours, not consistent with the schedule. Problems and concernes  are not kept anonymous. Fear of retaliation as far as tampering with your hours and schedule due to the lack of anonymity and lack of trust with immediate leaders."
bad,"Got your running shoes on for the laps you’ll race over 130,000 square feet?  Ready, set, go!"
bad,"Not sure what to include, other then the culture was a dog eat dog world. Not that great of a place to work at. More of just a job, that can get you to the next."
bad,You will hate this job.  This company has no values no morals.  You will be treated like garbage they don’t care . They will make you feel like quitting every day.
bad,"worked for years with little raises til I started college. management only cares about hitting the sales numbers for the day month and year, although they say they care about their employees they do not. when I left they were hiring people at they same pay rate I had worked hard to achieve over the years I worked there. one manager had quit because he kept trying to get a better schedule so he could watch his small 2 children while his wife worked and they kept denying him a schedule change. avoid target it is a dead end low pay job."
bad,"The managers suck, hr sucks, the employees attitudes suck. Work isnt done. New people get more than those that have been there longer. No hours. NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!"
bad,"This company has a blantant disregard for human life. Workers are treated like slaves. You cannot call in sick without getting the fourth degree. They will say they are flexible with scheduling to get you in the doors, and as soon as express a need for a certain day or time off, they will cut your hours. They will also cut your hours if they want you to quit because they won't fire you. You will never move up. And you will never get trained to do your job correctly. And if you do a great job, and work really hard, you can do your job and someone else's job. And if you're a really hard worker, you can train your new leader and also to their job for the same amount of pay! Management is completely incompetent because Target realises if they hire younger, dumber people, they can pay them less because they get off on the facade of power. If you have dignity and integrity at all, you will feel yourself slowly hating life while you search indeed for a new job."
bad,"They seem to be gaming the system. They hire seasonally then fire virtually everyone and replace them with seasonal hires. This prevents them from having to provide benefits or raises or any of the things that you earn by working someplace for a long time. When I was hired there were around 50 people hired at the same time. At least 20 would have been great permanent hires but they only hired 1 person permanently out of that pool. If you really only want a job for a couple months, go for it otherwise stay away."
bad,"Well mgt. Could use a lot of fixing. Customer service could not have the welcome to target what are you here to still mantelaty. Could hire older experiencd in great customer service. Team work here needs to shape up or ship out in the Amazon world,."
bad,"The lady I was constantly in contact with for my hours was extremely horrible towards me and only liked to schedule my shifts in 4 hours on my days off from my first job. Promised to work around my first jobs schedule, never did. They liked to change the schedule around too and not tell you, so lots of hours were confused and it was just an overall mess."
bad,"The Team Leads were always pushing you to do more than was possible, yet they were rarely there to help as they should be. They did not stand behind if you made a decision as we were told to do and would be talk down to in front of guests. iT was awful.The discount was low, no benefits, no sick or holidays. You would ask for a day off for a certain issue dr. or family and they would purposefully schedule you that day- then talk about whether you would call off."
bad,The absolute worst job i ever had... ive workee for busier stores and succeedes yet my manager had the nerve to tell me inwas to slow... i worked there for about 2 months then had my hours cut to 15... needless to say inwalked right out of there and never went back... worst job ever... would rather go back to wal mart
bad,"Executive management is lazy and inexperienced at working with people. Everyone, including executive managers, gossip about each other. Executive managers let their personal feelings affect their professional decisions. You will get written up for calling out every time you do it whether its one time or 50 times, and they say they don't penalize you for it but your hours WILL be cut even if you call out with a doctors not. Executive management pits team members against each other. You will be pressed to accomplish more work than realistically possible every day while executive management walks around with Starbucks or sits in the training room eating together and talking. You'll be asked to do much more than what is required of your pay grade. You will be asked to perform leadership duties under the guise of moving up and getting promoted, but they will not give you a pay raise and it will take 1 year at minimum for them to actually promote you after you take on the role of a leader, and sometimes it doesn't happen at all. This is truly a horrible place to work. The only good thing is that the other team members are usually great people."
bad,If you get hired for cashier expect to be on the cash register all day. One day they had me at the register for 3hours with no help or break. At the Westfield mall during black friday.
bad,The work was very relaxing working with the team members were like family to me. The atmosphere was was fun. Aside from these was one of the team leaders. Even though I was recognized as an accomplished hard worker by the team members and some of the team leaders I was still got laid off without an explanation. A number of long time( of more than a year)  employees have been laid off so there is no time for career advancement even if you were dedicated to the job.
bad,im not very smart and asked alot of questionswhich made them act mean towards me and they started creating rumors so they could get me out of the job and i find that very appauling
bad,"They treat you unfair , they work you harder than actual target workers ,.. if your seasonal or temp they will work you way harder , it’s too hot , they say if you feel like your gonna pass out don’t come but that makes no sense at all , they write you up for using the bathroom to much , some coworkers pick ..."
bad,"At Target, you are expected to work during holidays including Thanks Giving."
bad,Bad management worse human resources department and if you have mental health issues of any sort they don't help you or work with you rather against you.
bad,"I worked there as a Part time Seasonal Employee, the Hours were long, As a cashier the only movement you got was when you went on lunch. The long hours of just standing still and being unable to even travel to the register next to you resulted in me having lower back pain that forced me to see my Doctor."
bad,"As a growing Global company with many moving parts, communication within departmental roles can be difficult. However, this is an area that has greatly improved overtime and the company has offered different initiatives to ensure/assess growth."
bad,"I only worked at target for a short time due to the HORRIBLE management and Human Resource department. I had the position of a FLOW team member, my shift was from 4 AM to 8/9 AM. The month that I was employed there I didn't receive a single paycheck. I wasn't issued an employee number until my final week so I had to manually keep track of my hours, my management was also in no hurry to make sure my hours were accounted for. When I finally quit due to the awful experiences I had It took three weeks to receive any kind of payment. HR was in no hurry to help me saying they sent my checks however they never arrived. I finally had to contact cooperate and get them sent to me. I was also told to stock/ count the stock in the walk in freezer and was not given gloves/hat/ or a coat, it was incredibly cold and I was in there probably 20 minutes freezing."
bad,I was hired by an awesome hr and store manager and then once they left the brought in a hr and a new store manager an hr who tried to get people fired and lied to her employees face and store manager who was giving his own store and not know what to do with it
bad,"I would have to collect all the carts around the store and outside being that the store location was by a mall I would have to travel all around for carts mostly which could take hours at a time, granted this was over 9 years ago."
bad,"The pay was poor and the management was bad. My immediate manager was good, buy his boss showed no concern wen employees would't show up for their shifts. One night my co-worker failed to show up for his shift, the manager on staff said that it wasn't his job to find another worker."
bad,"They get you in the door and then use you through the Holiday periods only for the times you need them at the Distribution Center then lay you off."
bad,I would never work here again! They over work all there employees. I felt like a slave we were always short employees cause the turn over rate at the boulder target! Everyone quits we lost ten people In a month this included 5 managers from different departments that have had been there for years that should tell you alot and the people who do stick around get treated bad one lady i knew well had been there 8 years and they keep her at part time so she can't qualify for benefits that is so wrong! And if your not working to were your sweating n almost killing yourself they aren't happy with you! I worked my self sick here cause I'm a hard worker and they took advantage of that. Finally I couldn't take it anymore. And the communication there is awful ecspecially between managers. And most employees who have been there don't even work they just talk so your left sound there work plus yours and management does nothing or hr save you the trouble and don't work here. Everyone I knew hated working here!
bad,My mom  Has worked for target for 10 years now..  In the beginning she was happy come to work and do her job  Well and right she work from 3:am 12pm.. or sometimes 5am-11am.. years go by  No opportunity to grow   Only a raise of 10 cents or 20 cents. Now she makes 11hr. Now there  Cutting her hours given her 4 hrs a day.  Managers making her feel bed in I listen to her. What she got to say..now my mom is tired.. after all those years she put for TARGET. TARGET Dont Realize she  one of best coworkers. Just because she cant speaks  English well doesn't mean anything!!!! People that work hard she be  Given a chance to grow or a higher Pay!
bad,Target was a fun environmental place to work at when I first started worked with your schedule. Know target wont care if you have class on certain days. They really don't care for there employees more about sales at this point.
bad,not a great place to work if you have bills to pay. great for teens and people who live with there parents. you must drive red cards or risk losing your job
bad,It’s no team work  we work like slaves low on team members and no team work going on lotta team members leaving they hiring anyone they can ask for on paper lotta funny busines going on when you put your two weeks In they find any way to write you up when you move ate wanna work for a different target
bad,"It was horrible. The hours aren't reliable unless you're a supervisor. The expectations and timelines are unrealistic. They ""offer benefits"" but, what they don't tell you is that you have to have an average of 30plus hours to qualify for them and even if you're off by 1.50 hours they won't give it to you. It's a job for someone fresh out of highschool to enjoy as a first experience, not a job for someone to live off of. The raises range anywhere from $0.01(lowest raise I got)  to $0.35 (the highest) and if the minimum wage goes up, that's your ""raise"""
bad,No real advancement chance. Its a dead end job that really is meant for holding over till something better but the work environment is very toxic here.
bad,"target management is horrible, they let managers get away with a lot even if they have a paper trail of complaints. they aren't understanding of your school schedule if still are in school. also not very fair with the scheduling, if you are available to close everyday they will make you close everyday and by the time you get out of work it will be 1 am, even if they close at 11."
bad,My supervisor was CORRUPT. I never got the hours I requested and when I did it was because people kept quitting and they needed someone to extend there shift. Constantly beat down by coworkers and management and the benefits are not worth any of the treatment I recieved
bad,You might as well work at a distribution center that will pay you sufficiently instead of getting paid to bust your back for the same wage as a cashier
bad,In order to succeed here you have to be very selfish and suck up to your supervisors. The team leads play favorites a lot and you can see that with the schedule and the promotions. Not worth it for minimum wage.
bad,"As a receiver your job is looked upon as the one job that nobody wants to do, the management  knows nothing about the area.  Don't go on vacation, there is absolutely no respect for the area (nothing gets done, product piled up and leaking) and if it is done, it's done wrong.  The store management is lazy, they are never wrong and if they don't like you, they will dig deep to write you up.  The job is supposed to be 40 hours a week, didn't have 40 hours almost 2 years (hours were only  supposed to be cut for a couple weeks)"
bad,i worked with target almost two years and even though i worked my behind off picked up other peoples shifts hardly ever called in sick or was late and they got rid of me because of a couponers word over mine. that's okay i believe everything happens for a reason and i will find the right job for me!
bad,"This place is horrible! Abusive customers who leave mess after mess and try to cheat the store with fake/expired coupons. The managers are petty tin dictators and spoiled lazy college kids with the mental capacity of toddlers, who are literally paid for their smiles, they are lazy and abusive...Management never accepts blame, never gives credit where/when due, and does not respect employee rights."
bad,"It sucks. If you don't have to work here, then do yourself a favor and don't do it. The hours can suck. The work is not great. The customers are entitled and can usually suck."
bad,Working at the Starbucks inside super target was horrible. The management was horrible they don't care for their employees and there are call outs every day so they leave you alone to struggle.
bad,very very poor management. Absolutely no consequences for employees that don't do their jobs and instead leave it for others to take care of while better employees are abused and made to do everything. would not suggest working here to anyone
bad,"DON'T get a job here. They hired me as a sales floor associate but they moved me to a backroom associate because I'm big a guy and think I'm stupid. Most of managers are petty, disrespectful and lazy so they are always hiring because alot of people leave. If you are new there's also a chance they mess up your check or not pay you for day so be warned."
bad,"Absolutely worst company to work for. Management were careless and cost the company a lot money, treated team members like lowly class citizens. terrible wages"
bad,"Target calls their executives and lower level managers ""Team Leaders,"" but absolutely have no understanding about what leadership is about.  The executives know how to be a boss--blow up the radio and tell everybody else what to do--but certainly do not know how to motivate or encourage team members to produce more.  If these executives would roll up their sleeves and pitch in, they would get a great deal more effort, and respect, from the employees.  Sadly, instead, they set themselves apart--above--the team members.  I cannot recommend it as a place to work."
bad,Target is a great place to work. when you start getting paid to much they will conspire to fire you. They will write you up for nonsense and throw you out like trash. I you like being treated like trash target is the place to work. They give every one all the  Special High Intensity Training they want.
bad,Will say anything in interview to get you on board.  No real management that creates a problem with associates doing whatever they want.  Retail merchandising is a joke in this store.  Theft is a major problem within the store.  People actually go into the dressing room and load up with merchandise and walk out of the store.  They have people in key positions with no real experience.
bad,"Target was my first job. This isn't for all locations but the Wylie one in particular is terrible but I believe the corporation as a whole is just awful. They ask for your availability but always schedule outside of your availability. If you ask for time off they take it personally and cut back your hours. I haven't worked over 20 hours in like 6 months. I have bills and they just don't care. They're just so petty and they're so strict. It's more like a prison than a job. But if you like good pay and no hours, GO AHEAD."
bad,"All the managers would team up against a group on associates and practically give them no other option but to quit. It was quite sad to be honest, would never refer anyone to ever work here in my life."
bad,At first it’s fantastic until you get to a point when new management doesn’t know what they’re doing and start to intentionally try and get you fired because they are stuck up.
bad,"Management is very rude, overbearing, overpowering, degrading, belittling, disrespectful, jealous. "
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of me arriving and clocking in, getting my gear that i needed ( walkie talkie, and mydevice ) and then head over to electronics. I would then guest service for most of the shift and clean for the other part. The pay for the work that i was doing was good, but the management was what made the place horrible to work at. Anything above and beyond that you did was never recognized, i would often research electronics that we sold so i would have a large amount of knowledge about the product so if i was asked i could let the guests know immediately. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be around new technology, and being able to help others understand it and answer any questions that they might have had. Meeting new people was a good time as well"
bad,Working as a cashier here was so stressful. I was pressured constantly to sign people up for credit cards. If I did not get a certain amount of cards per day they would yell at me and threaten to fire me. I would always get horrible hours and shifts with less than 5 hours so I would not be required to take a lunch. It became such a problem that I would get yelled at by customers for asking them about the red card. If I did not ask a customer management would pull me aside and yell at me. I left after 3 months and became so much happier.
bad,Target was difficult to maintain a pleasant working atmosphere.  The management was very uncaring to many employees and therefore much turn over was happening.
bad,"I have never had a job treat me like this place. For starters, When I was hired, I was promised 20-25 hours and I am only receiving maybe 15. Many times I’ve asked for more hours but they “don’t have extra hours to spare” yet they are looking to hire new part-time employee in my section."
bad,"There wasn't really anything participial typical in my work day expect collecting carts I had several other responsibility's I had to attended to vicariously, My squeal was always flexing around for others thous my hours were weird.. I learned nothing useful other than working a requester and cart machine. The management was always there but suffocating and odd no one id wish to work with again. The hardest part of the job was juggling all the requests of my supervisors customers and directed job title (Cart Attendant) everyday for which I surmised 12 an hour wasn't worth the stress. The best part was the time I had  essentially was being by my self during closing around 10 were it slowed down."
bad,Nothing about the job made you want to be there. The management made everything seem like its your fault. The customers would yell at you for things you didn't even know about in the store because that wasn't your department. Just overall horrible work experience.
bad,"Poor management, no advancement because no one takes you serious because you’re young. Since you’re young you get all the shifts that are left over than no one wangs to work. They work you so you’re under 40 hours so you’re not considered full time so you don’t get paid time off or benefits"
bad,The management are teenagers . Very young staff and don’t leave by example. They give us a great work load and such little time with no help. They cut down the hours . One week your promised 40 then u check your schedule and have 21. Very unfair company to work for. The HR staff is very unprofessional and do not talk to staff well
bad,It's a mediocre job. Definitely not worth working at this place unless you plan to stay with retail. Very difficult to move up and they want you to push credit cards on customers which I feel is wrong.
bad,"It is exactly what you think a retail job would be: long hours, working holidays, working weekends, underpaid, tough work, almost impossible to meet goals."
bad,"The Target I work for is unorganized, and unprofessional.. They cut your hours less than 20 hours as a full time worker... They won't even allow us to go over 40 hours.. They start you off with good pay but don't give you hours.. And they don't treat their employees right. And they lack communication."
bad,"Working at Target is hard. They hire too many people so that they don't have to give you full time hours and they expect you to be available when they have call outs, even though they don't want to give you the hours and the Mangers have favorites. If you are not liked by the Store Team leader you don't get hours."
bad,"The supervisors at Kennewick Target are terrible to work with and treat other employees with no respect. I would not recommend working at this location to anybody, but I hear other Targets are much better work environments."
bad,Do not work there mangers are terrible. The store is poorly run. Everyone just is angry all the time about being there. The store is not a good place to work.
bad,"Store is run by irresponsible leaders who barely work themeselevs but pile too much work onto everybody else. Location is rank with workplace gossip. Good workers are under appreciated, bad workers are favoritized, and management can’t behave like adults. Would not recommend to anybody."
bad,Don’t really suggest working here. Wasn’t paid enough and the managers weren’t very nice. They didn’t care if you were sick or not you had to come in but they could miss whenever they wanted.
bad,"working for target is like working in a cult like atmosphere. employees are forced to ask customers if they want a ""target Red Card"" and pressure to make sure they get that red card for the company"
bad,"Management does not care about its employees, neither does the store manager. Always telling employees to do things better and not slack off, but management does it anyways and sets a very bad example. Cut throat, constant ""coaching"" (talking to that does not directly lead to a write up), write ups, worst place I have ever worked. You need to be with the company for 1 year, and have to have 1200+ hours to be eligible for any type of benefits."
bad,"Target was a sinking ship when I worked there in 2006, I can only speculate how bad it is now. The managers were all more interested in their own careers and how to look good, the store suffered immensely from this lack of focus. The pay is poor which only attracts the most desperate job-seekers."
bad,I have to type  a minimum here so I will.  I didn't like Target or anything about it.  It was an overnight job where the quality of life is abhorrent.
bad,"Not so great place if you want to move up "
bad,Managers is inappropriate with customers and employees. I was doing manager jobs and felt I was not getting paid enough for the work I was doing. Business was usually slow
bad,"It doesn't matter what is happening in your life, if you are scheduled for a shift, they treat you like you better be dead if you're going to miss it. I know people that avoided going to the hospital just because they knew they would be fired if they missed a shift."
bad,no manners or self respect for customers or employees there are many difficulty's working at target I could not meet my finical needs working in this department store
bad,"I was over worked, not given enough support to complete the tasks given then punished for it later. One of my managers tried t basically scare me into doing their projects instead of my own so no matter what I would get yelled at the next day."
bad,I work at target. They pay really well. Just be ready to earn every penny of that. What ever you do don't get sick or hurt. They are always looking for a reason to fire
bad,the management team had no idea what they were doing . in a typical day i would have 3-4 management tell me different duties in the first 15 minutes . they will target you if you show the ability to do your own work .
bad,I did not like working at target at all. I was pushed around because I was young and everyone treated me like a child. I felt used and they would make me do things that were not apart of my job description. When someone from a different section did not show up they would ask me to stay longer to work their shift.
bad,I gave them my school schedule and they never worked with it even though they said they would be flexible and I worked flip flop week where I would get 40 hours one week and 10 the next!
bad,"Target only looks out for themselves not their employees."
bad,Its a good place to work if you like getting lied too. My LODs dont communicate with each other very well which leads to stressful situations for all team members.
bad,"Typical retail environment, which was fast paced at times and demanding. You have to put up with guest being rude, low pay, and very little benefits. Managers don't help out either."
bad,"No matter how hard you work your work does not matter , there's not opportunity to move on. Lack of management , most of the time the managers don't have respect for each other."
bad,"They will let you go over anything really. It’s ridiculous, and insane. I was let go all of a sudden after weeks of low hours. It felt like something was wrong. Overall the management can really use some communication with their employees. They were truly never there for me whenever I needed some hours or something. Everything was done by me manually, which is not bad but it would be nice to have assistance of management. Why else would they be there? Half the time I would see them just chatting. Usual temporary workplace, obviously was not for me."
bad,I was there as a seasonal employee and it was not a good experience.  They explained very little but expected you to pick up everything very quickly.  Very little help when you needed it.
bad,communication between management and employees is not good at all.  Hours are always cut.  There is never any coverage when needed.  They treat you like garbage.
bad,"I love to shop at target. But working there is a different store. Management does not care about employees. They don’t care about student workers. They especially give you all night shifts and you won’t leave until 12 am sometimes, not caring about your class schedule. Not saying i didn’t want to work nights at all, but  every night you work is terrible. Pay is horrible. And they pressure you to sale red cards but won’t pay you commission."
bad,"When I was offered the job at Target I thought it was going to be a great place to work but I was totally wrong. They expect you to work without proper training. Then they tell you that you need to work faster to meet their expectations but don't go into detail on what exactly you need to work on ""faster"". The Executive Team Leader, Ryan, has no business being in charge of anyone. He fires people for mistakes that they make when they don't even know they are making them because you were not properly trained. If Target had any sense they would fire him immediately! This is a horrible place to work and they don't care about any of their employees. They don't give you any hours, give you way to much stuff to do in an unrealistic amount of time to do it in, micromanage everything you do, criticize you about everything and could care less about your well being as an employee. Worst place I've ever worked at!"
bad,I don’t like target. Well the one I worked at. The people are nasty and will do anything to get you fired if they don’t like you. I worked there for a year and I didn’t like one bit.
bad,"I worked at the distribution center in Chambersburg, PA.They did not treat there employees good. alot of looking for reason to firer you then ways to help better the process."
bad,"i applies for cashier and they had me on the sales floor and i hated it, i was just constantly stocking shelves, returning items to there original spot, it was horrible."
bad,"trash. trash. trash. trash . just dont do it.they suck, management was trash, environment garbage, and upper management would never act on anything. EVERRRR"
bad,"would not recommend ppl work here "
bad,not a place to work when you have bills that need to be paid. The hours are never reliable and the pay is awful.. there is a reason its a retail job and not a career.
bad,"Did not enjoy the job at all; they barely put me on the schedule because they said ""Oh well we are covered for that day/week"" So I quit because why work somewhere where you're not getting enough hours???"
bad,"This job was not fun for me. Constantly micro managed, you had to sell credit cards and the management was poor. I dont recommend to anyone but thats just my opinion."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for bar none. Don't make the same mistakes I did. They don't care about their employees, they over work and under pay."
bad,"This review is specifically for the Starbucks position inside of target. It was the worst and most ridiculous job I have ever worked. The customers are terrible, needy, self-righteous, and impractical. The managers are, for the most part, neglectful. They basically refused to help anybody unless it benefited them."
bad,"Your tossed into the job with no training. The employees are supposed to train you but don't want to take the time and wont act like they want you there. Your expected to do many jobs in a fast manner and it's never enough. There is not enough employees to do all the jobs, so expect to be asked to do the job of many. Lots of special treatment for all the older employees. Don't complain or you'll lose the job...."
bad,not happy working there at all to much micromanaging throughout company lots of backstabbing to move up in company. day to day tasks were never completed correctly.
bad,not a good experience working here. hated it. they expect a 5ft 115lb woman to lift 80lb or more. and be quick at it. would not recommend working here.
bad,"There is a general lack of respect from both your leaders and your peers, and many empty and broken promises were made to keep you working. Don't even bother trying to call out when you're ill, your leaders will still expect you to come in."
bad,Would never recommend working here if your opening a new store they need you but after opening your hours get cut from almost 40 a week to 15 hours a week after promising 30 plus hours a week
bad,"Had all of the really important corporate managers come in a few days ago and ask me questions, i got nervous and stumbled over my words and now they are treating me like I'm the scum of the earth."
bad,"Management are vindictive, hateful but nice to your face, and are willing to lose strong, very productive workers for their own personal reasons. "
bad,"This is not that good of a company to for, they keep you under 40 hours and they do not promote from within. They do not schedule enough people to work so you are left doing the job of 2 people."
bad,I would never recommend this company be worked for. I have seen management attack each other and they demand you to do more work than what they want to pay for. They give you time limits on things like doing a plano gram for a whole wall and give you 30 minutes to take down and set completely up and is not feasible in some cases.  Too many managers standing around and talking and not bothering to lift a finger.
bad,"I've worked here for 3 years and its just not worth it, the only reason to stay was that I could work and then go to school when I got off at 10, as a full time student it would've been hard to find a full time job that worked with the schedule."
bad,"The management was really rude and didnt care about you unless you were their best friend, they weren't accommodating to schedules and would constantly change the schedule with out telling you."
bad,The hardest part of that job was dealing with them customers. The public was to  much for  me to deal with be honest an the managers were not know better. Take every word the customers says an even out words in yo mouth to! The place was ok! Never got to close to no one all two-faced even the managers. Some of the people that were nice to me and some co-workers that I did talk to.
bad,"This company used to be great to work for, while there was always a lot of work to be done, the new direction the company has taken is now requiring over double the previous amount of work to be done in less time. The management does not reward or promote their hardest working team members. Team member are expected to complete 16+ hours of work in now less than 6 hours, leaving the team stressed out and no longer finding enjoyment with the job. The management does not listen to their team and when the team is able to find a routine that works to accomplish all the tasks assigned, management changes said routines and leaves the team to figure out how to make things work all over again. This style of leadership has lead to the loss of the most hardworking and dedicated team members."
bad,"A typical day of work is working the job of 3 people and getting paid for one. You have to be a fast multitasker or you will fail in this company. This company has no compassion or empathy for their employees. They put too much on their employees and yell at them if they are unable to get the job done. Management is horrible. Every manager has a different perspective on leadership, so if you listen to one manager and a different manager tells you to do something else, you can get in trouble. They never listen to your side of things. They only have assumptions."
bad,fast paced when it is busy. Always make sure you check underneath their carts when you are a cashier or else they will think that you let them go stealing items.
bad,My management team was terrible. The manager usually did not arrive to the scheduled shifts and never met the quotas. This is a job that should not be given. Regional manager is not that great either. Everything is done through GroupMe chat. So unprofessional.
bad,"Neither employees or management were kind. Cliques , favoritism, and bullying. Objectives and job responsibilities not clear. Dirty store. Bad energy."
bad,The Target atmosphere was stressfull for me. Management was unaccomodating and unhelpful. No matter what department you are placed in you will be doing everything and you will not be able or qualified to do any of it. The break room is just everyone sitting and talking about how miserable and achy they are.
bad,For a 12 hr a week job the expectations are unreasonable. The expectations are unachievable and the verbal abuse incurred by supervisors is unacceptable.
bad,The Target atmosphere was stressfull for me. Management was unaccomodating and unhelpful. No matter what department you are placed in you will be doing everything and you will not be able or qualified to do any of it. The break room is just everyone sitting and talking about how miserable and achy they are.
bad,It was an okay place to work but the management sucks and they yell at you and get down on you about everything. It’s incredibly fast paced. They tell you guest experience and selling is the number one hung but always just have stocking things and making things look good. Then when you don’t get enough sold they yell at you.
bad,The hours were not flexible and if you went over 1 second for overtime you would get a warning or write up depending on how many times you did that. The management was constantly on us to make deadlines when the deadlines were not reachable. we were pushed so fast that accuracy was thrown out the window. when you started work there you can totally feel the atmosphere there was miserable and no one wanted to work there. The only good thing about working there was working with the other employees. That is what kept me working at Target for so long.
bad,"Not only does the management harass you about getting their RedCard goal for the day, they threaten to fire you as well. I have worked many other places as a cashier that needed their employees to make their 'card' goals for the day/week. I've NEVER had a place threaten to fire a person though."
bad,The place is horrible and management is very awful and information gets out behind closed doors regarding HR and nobody wants to help you with any of the problems that go on in the store itself.
bad,terrible lack of management. Had almost no organization. leadership did not have a good enough understanding of operations to be effective in helping team members.
bad,"Management was horrible, There was nothing but drama between co-workers, and there was absolutely no room for advancement. I was with Target for almost two years and they gave the promotion to the new guys that wasn't even with the company long enough to receive benefits."
bad,"Target pay sucks and they do not work with your life.  I worked there for 14 years and recently quit because they wanted me to work full time, which i already had a full time job.  Target pressure me into quitting and did not follow through on their promised."
bad,"one boss tells you to do one job, another comes along and tells you to do another. Left hand does not know what the right is doing. Bosses only care about getting their work done and do not care who does it."
bad,"It was an average work place. Average pay and average management. I didn't take too much from it. It gave me communication skills over the phone and interactive engagement with guests, but apart from that, this job was sub-par. I got minimal hours, which I wasn't too fond of, but it got me through. Don't ask for more hours, just try covering somebody instead, because you won't get more hours."
bad,"Working there was terrible, nobody does their job properly everyone is so lazy especially team leads and ETL's. They always take breaks together, and sit around in offices all day long talking and laughing never willing to lend a helping hand. Team leads mainly dump their workloads onto regular team members who get paid way less. Closings are the worst because they still refuse to help but will spend 2+ hours eating in the break room together or talking about other employees poorly while sitting at their desks or even walking around the store for all to hear. They are very mean to employees, almost like I was back in high school with the amount of crazy gossip and bullying the team leads and ETL's bring upon the atmosphere of the store. A lot of favoritism is shown with certain employees as well. Get pulled into the office for silly reasons mainly just for higher-ups to show off their ""power"". Not equal pay, equal jobs get paid different amounts, inconsistent hours, never allowed time off, very strict with availability. 10/10 I do not recommend working here."
bad,"It treats the people that have been there the longest with resentment and hatred. It does not want people to become loyal to the company."
bad,"Working at target was very stressful. In flex, you had to pick what the customers wanted out on the floor and then bring it to the back to pack and ship. You had to pick many batches but each batch could have 1-40 items in just one batch. Target wanted you to pick one batch every 30 minutes. Which seemed impossible especially on Black Friday. Management was rude. Very low hours. It was not worth it."
bad,I would never recommend working here to anyone honestly. This was the worst place I have ever worked at. Please just stay away from target as a job choice.
bad,"Terrible management, unreasonable weekly credit card goal, managers would forget to give out breaks, rude customers, dirty restrooms, no recognition, they change schedules without letting you know, horrible hours, overall terrible"
bad,They have people who barely graduate from high school and work experience as managers. Many of the mangers was friends with other managers. They don't care about your health and safety
bad,"Management was bad, hours were bad, customers were bad. 0/10 would never recommend anyone with a shred of self respect to work here under any circumstance. Just sell drugs."
bad,I would only recommend working here as a first time job and only for a couple of months for experience not a good place for advancement lots of bias and favoritism
bad,"I hated my managers who were incompetent and would verbally harass the staff. We were told we were expendable and sometimes sent home without even clocking in because ""we weren't needed""."
bad,"The managers are young and very rude, the employees aren't trained at all. Therefore its up to the other employees to train em, the stores management is horrible. The break room is filthy and the managers are constantly standing around talking and making up new rules based on there emotions and how they feel about people. It's just a huge mess!"
bad,"Got tired of standing in one spot all day for 8 hours. They refused to train me in a different area in the store. Poor management. They don't care if customers steal or use fake coupons because the managers just want the customer satisfied. No the customer is not always right, actually the customer is wrong 99% of the time and all these companies like Target & Walmart need to realize that."
bad,I do not have anything more to add regarding my experience at Target. This was a typical retail sales job. I learned alot about people at Target during my time there.
bad,"You work really long hours and get small breaks. No breaks if it's really busy and you're scheduled only 4 hours during peak. You have to harass people every second of the day about Red cards or else you get harassed all day. If you are sick, obviously sick, you still have to work even though you are coughing, running nose and sneezing on people and touching the registers."
bad,"I really wish Target was going under instead of Toys R Us.  This company pays 'team leads' almost twice as much as workers, and they do less than half the work."
bad,Management is mean and I felt like I was in high school. I was expected t do the work of three people and was disciplined for not being able to complete a ridiculous list of things.
bad,"I did not like working here at all. They reprimand you for something as little as where you stand during huddle, and are WAY too competitive when it comes to pushing store credit cards. The sign-up discount for that card is just not worth it, and is not safe to have. Management was also very manipulative, and forces its associates to work Thanksgiving and Christmas."
bad,Lack of hours. No healthcare benefits for part time wokers. Hr never gives anyone a chance to get hourly average up so someone could apply for healthcare
bad,"Don't ever expect advancement, no matter how much they may whisper it in your ear to try and have you improve your work flow, AKA pick up the slack for everyone else. Horrible management who have no clue how to keep people working instead of slacking off. Left the majority of work on the shoulders of a few people with good work ethic, but of course did not pay them any more than those who slacked off and did nothing. If you can't find any other job, this pays some bills. Don't get stuck here, it's a sad life to lead in a corporate business like Target that does not care one bit about your health, life or advancement. Back stabbing, gossipy, and ridiculous workplace culture. If you're a good worker you will be taken advantage of."
bad,"Sucks whooly. never work here unless the only alternative is abject poverty. Unappreciative management, favoritism, poor benefits, poorly staffed. All around unacceptable."
bad,"This was the worst job i have ever had and i imagine that most people who have worked at target will say the same thing"
bad,"I worked at the ""parole"" location for the back stock. The hours were horrifying, one day you'd be there there till 9pm and the next day they'd expect you be there at 4am. I once tried to just sleep on my car between such a shift and got yelled at by HR. The ""job culture"" there was just make money do the almighty Target. Didn't even get benefits, I was full time but they worked me the most minimum of hours so I didn't technacly qualify."
bad,"They do not train their management very well. My manager made me keep working 40 hrs a week after pulling my back on the job. Would not work with me while I was supposed to be on light duty. Actually wrote me up for refusing to throw the freight.  If I was older and knew better I would have faught it legally. But I was young and need my job desperately.  "
bad,loaded freight management sucked i hated every minute it was the worse job ever there was some good thing maybe but i didnt see them others did but it sucked
bad,Target used to be a great place to work for them they hired so many different managers for the company has made the company very not understanding and all they care about is making money they don’t care how hard you work you’re always doing something wrong
bad,"pay is not equal, stores in predominately  white areas the employee is paid more than in the black area although it is the same position. example Cashier in Buckhead start at $12-13 at Camp Creek $11."
bad,Taget was a slave driving business that didn't care about building up its eployees but liked to have a high turn over rate that no one liked that i worked with.
bad,"I was offered a full-time Cake Decorator position, I made sure to state ,in the interview, how important it was for me to receive as close to 40 hours as possible. Since I'm a single mom and it's my only income. They wanted complete open availability. And said if I was willing to Cashier part of the time that they would make sure my hours were always there. Making it impossible to also have asecond job"
bad,"Lethally bad management will doom this company in the next five years. Everything they do shows total contempt for the team members that do the actual work, and that's why we're leaving in droves. My ""raise"" last year was ten cents an hour. Run far away."
bad,Target is a fun work place. The only down fall is hours are not always as good. I can go weeks with 12 to 15 hours a week and that is not enough of hour's.
bad,"Management is petty and they act like teenagers. Unprofessional. Hours are only given to people they like, not to the ones who work the hardest. I would not recommend anyone to work here if you are a hard, and dedicated worker."
bad,"I was treated horribly by everyone. I was the only one who worked non stop, packing boxes and loading them onto trucks for 8+ hours a day with no orientation and minimal instruction."
bad,"I loved working there at first but then it was awful they would constantly push and scream at you to work faster, they never appreciated what you did for them, they said they would work around my school schedule and yet they always scheduled me on days they knew I couldn't work."
bad,"The hours were good at the time, because it was seasonal and it was busy. I got the job through a temp agency and was actually my first real job. I worked hard, but I didn't like the way we were forced to push the redcard. I didn't mind asking every so often, but they wanted  you to ask every single customer. They were sort of misleading in terms of keeping on people on after the holidays. They only kept 1 person out of all of us because he had no issue with getting screamed at and cursed out, but he'd also sold the most redcards. The employee discount was ok, but I didn't really earn enough money on the job to use it much."
bad,Not enough hours. One week I only worked 3 and a half hours. It's a great company but not one to be able to raise a family being that I have three boys to raise. Great for a student but not an adult with a family.
bad,At first it seems okay then later on you realize that this is a job for people who don't want to do anything else. Or they want to stop you from moving up. I would not recommend.
bad,"Safty violations, chemicals and mold on, in or next to food products. Priority changes daily no matter how far behind the story is. The lazy people get praise amd the ones who care to show up and work hard everyday just get told to pick up the slack and work harder."
bad,The schedule is never consistent.  One week you work at 3am then the next week or day you work at 2pm till close.  It isn't a good work environment.  The pay is barley minimum wage and no benefits.
bad,Horrible this place was honestly the worst to work at. It was so competitive it wasn't a good working environment if you didn't know the manager you were fired.
bad,"I got a concussion and they didn't file an incident report, nor let me leave, nor take me to the hospital. They wouldn't allow me time off once I went to the doctor and got diagnosed with a concussion."
bad,I had awful management who felt threatened if you appeared to want to move up the ladder. I had a bad car accident as well that put me on work restrictions. The management I was under ignored them and ordered me to do things I couldn't do with out putting myself in a large amount of pain. I went to HR about it and they only put a band aid on the situation. I culminated with the management retaliating by reducing my hours to 5 hours a week when I was a full time employee. Another talk with HR lead to nothing because HR felt the retaliation was justified. I would not recommend working here unless you are desperate.
bad,"EXPECT MORE from you as they PAY LESS."
bad,The amount of work and sales made based on the pay seemed unfair to me and the job just felt unstable overall.  Very few people advance and hours are very unorganized.
bad,"My average hours were 30. A new manger who manages from Asset Protection by reviewing security monitors, took over the Market Team I worked, assigned new, unqualified team members the Market Team.  He put me and three other team members, two of us with over three years experience, into another team in the Market area and took eighteen hours from each of the four assigned to the what Target calls the P'fresh Team.   A conversation with my Supervisor last Saturday informed me I need to look for another job."
bad,It Was An Okay Working Place The Workers Was Great But The Managers Were Not That Good With The Customers Or Co-Workers And Never Would Work With On Their Schdule's
bad,Trying to climb the work ladder. Most pegs are missing. Unless you have your head so far up your manager's butt then you can reach the next peg just below them. Then you kept it there hoping to make the next spot.
bad,"I haven’t been employed there for a year so I don’t fully j kw how much has changed, but the management that was there was terrible.  They hardly give hours out to deserving employees and advancement, it is very complicated to move up. Unless your managements favorite."
bad,"i was promised 36 hours a week. I got ten. They promised raises for being willing to cross train, I never got the raises. They refused to withhold court ordered child support from my pay. So, I got behind. They were told by a judge they were obligated to with hold it and send it in to the state of Tn. They still refused!"
bad,"It's not a bad to work at Target, but it is far from good. If you applied and checked up with them I would probably say you could get a job, but not the one you want. I remember applying for a different position, but the hiring manager would not let me and told me that if I wanted to work there I would have to be a cashier. I decided to stay because the pay was $10 an hour for part time. It's decent pay if it was your first time starting a job, but you should leave after a few months or a years. I did not want to work as a cashier, but stuck with it. If you don't mind standing in one spot for a little after 5 hours then this job is for you. Its kinda boring if you aren't doing anything, which is a lot. I'm the person who likes to do a task and then ask for the next task, not quickly but at a nice pace. Whenever I went to work I spoke with the guest/customer, rang them up, bagged their items, cleaned the lane, zoned the lane, and put away any unwanted products that people left in the lane which Target calls ""Reshop."" When you do Reshop you have to scan the barcode and put away the products in bins. You also have to put more bags in your area and dump all of your unwanted hangers in a bin/garbage can.You don't get to decide to take a break, the gstl(Guest Service Team Leader) tells you when you can and thats usually after 3 hours. Its an easy job, but really formulaic/repetitive. They give benefits, but if you aren't a new college student going to school at the beginning of a year or a full-time worker then you won't even use their benefits. Everyone gets a 5% discount on everything,"
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,If you will like to work with to face people very bad management and a horrible scheduling team apply No matter what they were always be a favorite and you will always be left at the bottom
bad,"A lot of people I know have gotten hurt there and they will do everything in their power to release you with no help for your injuries. They make you call in sick when you're hurt, and then terminate for not showing up"
bad,"i worked here for about almost 2 monthes and they didnt even care to train me. i worked my butt off everyday carrying heavy packages but they still fired me anyway. im a small guy about 5,7 and weigh only 140 pounds. compare to the other workers whos 200 Ib but they expected me to carry big heavy boxes for 10 hours at the same pace as the other bigger guys. one day they put me into a different department without any training or showing me what to do. i threw the boxes at my pace where i wouldnt be dead at the end of the day. and after 2 days they called me and fired me bc i wasnt as fast as the other bigger guys thats been working there for a few years. i come home ffrom work everyday with an aching body and sore legs and back. i tried my hardest to what i can do and at the end got fired anyways. i wouldnt recommend this job to any one of my friends or family bc they dont train you but expect you to do the job right, it dont make any sense. once they find some new people to fill in they wont hesitate to replace you."
bad,"I didn't like it."
bad,"The way AM workers were treated at the time was horrendous,tantamount to modern day slavery."
bad,Target does not care about their employees.  They have the worse benefits and the pay is horrible.  They expect you to work long hours at the spur of the moment.  No planning.
bad,"horrible experience working for target, lack of safety for employees, managers lied to cover up their failures and then blamed them on employees and forced team members to lie on their coworkers."
bad,Team members aren't very great about communication and neither is manager. I ended up having to contact my ex lead who had quit to get the information needed because nobody would answer me when I needed them to.
bad,Never had paychecks on time wasn’t capable of fulfilling promises such as the easiest things like having your pay checks ready and not loosing them. Just not an ideal place to work
bad,Wouldn't let my worst enemies work with those people. The management only cares about themselves. They do not cater too any needs of a normal employee they bully and just basically have zero care for employees. It's horrible and I feel bad my brother still works there.
bad,Long term employee who was fired right before thanksgiving after working there for 35 years and being one of the top performers. Target basically told me that after 35 years I dont know how to do my job.
bad,"Target is a terrible to work for. If you work there, expect cut throat management to chop you to pieces for even the smallest mistakes. If you get written up, you may find yourself feeling as if you committed a crime. They are not afraid to walk all over you even if you are disabled or cannot do certain things. Oh, and once they fire you, they won't pay for unemployment even if they're ordered to."
bad,Target was one of the worse job I have worked at. The people always had drama the LOD was always on someone's case when it was not needed. Did not care about schooling schedule and would put you on to work.
bad,"The people were great, management was really bad though. Mgmt was lazy and really didn't care. No full-time positions, and the pay was minimum wage even with experience"
bad,Management at Target is poor. They don't look after you. They don't care if you're okay or have hours or have a reasonable pay. They are rude and mean. I have nothing else to say.
bad,Receptionist
bad,"Everything started out great like promised. This was suppose to be  a permanent position. Make sure you get things in writing.... Always a lot of change with retail as we know. There was a lot of favoritism and personality problems within the store. The management can manage, but lacks the people skills. I am no longer there..."
bad,you worked hard there everyday. i didn't get to learn much there. the management was not far to the employee's. the hardest part for me was the management.
bad,"You had to kiss a lot of you know what to get nowhere. Did the carrot trick all year , then moved a hard line team member for softline team leader . Will say anything to get you to do more and it’s all lies"
bad,"They didn't give me enough hours while working there and then advised me that I was a seasonal employee and let me go. "
bad,While working at target there was a lot going on. it was during the holidays so i expected it to be hectic. Management was not very helpful they pushed very hard but they did not provide you with resources to succeed and get things done by the deadline.
bad,"Stand for hours in one spot, barely ever getting to wander from your little 2x4 square of endless checking out. Short breaks, bad managers (I still don't even know who the real manager was). Thank god is was temp."
bad,"This job requires long hours  and repetitious activities. You'll be working on an assembly line moving,  as a team, over 30-50 thousand items a night."
bad,"Although getting along with my co workers was super easy and fun, management is just a bad thing overall. The managers at my location specifically did not care for you they would throw any regular worker under the bus to save their own behinds as much as they needed to.  I worked here for 3 years and when i finally left they said i had 3, yes 3 paid vacation hours.  Would never recommended anyone to willfully work here."
bad,"Poor management, high turn over rates, the perm employees treated contractors like they did not matter, no flexibility. They did however feed us very well."
bad,this is absoluteley the worst place that i have ever worked during the holiday season we worked really long hours for really low pay one of the few places on the earth that still start their employees out at 7.25 an hour
bad,"I liked working here at first and then after awhile I started seeing the people who were getting moved up, the people that were the favorites of the higher ups. HR would never work with me with my college schedule. The discount was not good, 10% off IF you used your redcard or cash."
bad,"Target is a horrible place to work. Management is horrible! All they care about is making money. They could care less about their employees. They treat us like low life trash. They make you do three work of three people and cut your hours, then tell you how bad you are at your job. I hate target!"
bad,Managers ridicule their employees when they ask other employees questions. Nobody would help anyone. One mess up and the whole crew put a target on ur back it was a very hostile job constantly felt like I was targeted
bad,"Pulling and back stocking product. Dealing with a poorly run operation. Always instructed to do things that do not work costing time resulting in unfinished tasks. Then being blamed for unfinished tasks. I have learned that being a brown noser will get you more hours than working hard. Management does not want to face facts, just blame people. The hardest part of the job is back breaking labor for near minimum wages."
bad,While working at target a majority of employees were working 1-3 days a week with really short shifts. The management would schedule outside of your availability on a regular basis.
bad,"My experience at Target was not a great experience at all.  I felt I was overworked and underpaid. In addition, I had a supervisor that had integrity issues which made it difficult for her to honestly access any situation."
bad,Its was extremely stressful. No teamwork. No help from upper management. Disorganized. they crammed to red card down your throat. If you didn't sell it you got coached. stock was disorganized. thinks took forever to come in. As a trainer it was hard to train because they were always trying to train someone on multiple things and I never has enough time to train people. those that I did train I trained well. raises were a joke and the timeing of reviews were just bad.
bad,"Did not rehire a friend of mine due to disability. Was told accommodations would be made but never happened. This friend kept applying for over 3 months and was ignored and hung up on multiple times. "
bad,Cookie cutter talent.  No desire for experience.  Jump monkey jump attitude.  Employment expectations based off how well management was buttered up and ego stroked.
bad,No compassion for their team workers sometimes feel depressed working there they talk to you any kind of way but when you have kids you have to do what you got to do
bad,"The hardest part of the job is that we were never quite able to be ourselves to help our customers enjoy themselves as much as we would like them to. The most enjoyable part of the job were our short breaks and lunch breaks because we were able to share the wonderful stories our customers shared with us. A typical day at  target was hetic, always busy and rarely slow but it was nice because we were able to see our customers leave with a smile on their face. I am even able to help share a little laughter just to make the customers day a whole lot better."
bad,"Trust me you don't want to work for this company. Poor management lack of communication. I willingly left Target, this is not some bitter I got fired opinion."
bad,"I use to work at white marsh, md target. All but one manager was actually amazing. They only care about the employees they like. This is the worst company I have worked for, and I've worked at Wal-Mart. I actually resigned and I get multiple texts and calls about the team leads and some employees telling others I was fired. I should have listened to everyone when they told me that was the worst store to work for. Not to mention the fact that the managers are motivated by their own bonuses. They aren't leaders, they literally bark orders, and if things don't get done because they make you run around like a chicken with its head cut off, their whole attitude changes towards you. I can't speak for all the other stores but that store is the worst. And I am not the only one who thinks so."
bad,"I never thought I would work in retail but I succumbed to needing the income so I took the job.  The people were nice when I started there but became cutthroat and it always about work and you had to do ""busy work"" to get meaningless reports done and pointless parking lot patrols completed and catching thieves from taking small amounts of stuff. The management is just as poor always asking to find out when you are working next and it was not readily available like a professional organization should be and not engaging you in quality training.  It's one of the worst paying jobs I ever had to for someone with a degree and experience they don't care to give you what you are worth sadly.  You must clock out for your lunch time and it must be the full 30 minutes not a minute sooner or later. Oh and if by some miracle you worked a few minutes of overtime you could get penalized for it.  There is no team environment there at all and everyone must do their own work it's sad but they call themselves team members but don't practice what they preach.  I wouldn't wish working there for any job at target on my worst enemy. I have had my share of bad jobs but this one takes the cake."
bad,"Working at target is very stressful. Once you sign up they own you, they will have you working whenever they want at whatever time they want. Sometimes just 4 hours. They say they work your school schedule but that wasn’t my case"
bad,"Experienced to work in a large departmental store. Served customers with choices for different products in a single store.."
bad,"Unfortunately though people are friendly to an extent I feel as if it is not a workspace but more highschool. Not only that but you are expected to be as quick as everyone else, or if you're a new mom with bladder issues you're screwed. Overall bad experience."
bad,"No Cost Of Living raise. Some people only got 9 cents at their (ONCE) yearly raise. No one enjoys working here. Overnight is underappreciated, dayside is praised out the wazoo over nothing. Training is almost non-existent. If you are dating or friends with a Team Lead you can do basically anything (or not work at all) and still get a paycheck. They try and keep people in the dark not letting information of pay increase out, so that they are paying long time employees LESS than their brand new employees. I make 24 CENTS MORE THAN ALL THE PEOPLE I TRAIN FOR THEM... People who have worked here for 20 years are barely being paid more than new employees. It's not worth it to work here. A lot of rude co-workers too, but I know they can't control that at least."
bad,"Poor communication from management. When calling in for the passing of a friend, it was never documented, therefore upper management wasn't informed and called me in for information. Thus I realized this company wasn't a good fit."
bad,"Etls that don’t know what there doing and no growth , very hard to move up, takes advantage of there workers, bad hr department very poor ran for a team member to gain a raise"
bad,Constant push on getting work done without concern for workers or there safety. Sometimes being made to work up to 4 hours before getting a break. Lunches provided for all employees except the flow team.
bad,fast paced environment however the amount of hours given are not reasonable will only be working like 12 hours a week and will not be notified of it at all
bad,They treat employees poorly unless they favor that employee. They give very few hours. And will call and cut your hours at a moment's notice. They want employees to quit rather than fire them
bad,"The particular store that I worked at (New Britain, CT) had poor pay, benefits, raises, and management.  A lot of managers were highly unqualified and treated the employees like children.  It was an easy job but the way it was managed made it a very poor experience.  I was embarrassed to work there the entire time I was employed."
bad,The paso store use to be fun to work at now with the new LODs and the head of HR they have ran this store into the ground and everyone that i work with all feel the same way plus the pay you get is not worth the ton of work they give you day to day. In all the paso robles store has gone down hill and would not recommend working at this store unless you really need the money.
bad,"Target will tell you what you want to hear during the interview process and change department responsibility after your hired. Bottom line, they lie to get you to accept the position. Do not work for a company that is not trustworthy!"
bad,"worse place that I have ever worked would not tell a friend or family member to work there mangers were even bad and only cared about them selfs "
bad,Target holds ZERO respect for its employees and treats them more like slaves or robots.  Voicing ones opinion is often frowned upon and considered insubordination.
bad,When I was hired on at Target I was supposed to be a cashier but every day I was a backup one and worked on the floor being a drone. Every time I came in to work no supervisor knew where I was supposed to be for that day and some days I would get in trouble for doing one task one supervisor wanted me to do because another supervisor came over and wanted me on one of their jobs.
bad,The managers had no idea what they were doing and the hours and what i had to do were wildly inconsistent. For example one day I got in trouble for not giving out enough red cards then the next day i was congratulated on how many i gave out by a boss i had never seen before.
bad,Save yourself the time and pain of working there. It is unprofessional and unorganized and management doesn't care about the workers in that area. Workers have to fend for themselves.
bad,"Target has a brutal, mismanaged, unfriendly work environment typical of a retail establishment that is slowly dying. Target is wholly focused on squeezing as much money out of each employee without concern for those employees well being."
bad,"Don’t work here. Overworked, underpaid. Rude, lazy management."
bad,There is no room for career growth. Promised team lead role a few times and got passed on them 3 times. Manager work me 13 days in a row knowingly. I will also get worked until 11pm and then start again at 3:30 am.
bad,Horrible management and planning. They never promote from within the same store. The only qualification you needed to get promoted was a degree. It didn't matter how terrible their work ethic or experience was. Worst job experience ever. There are far more places I'd rather work.
bad,Workload is overwhelming and I was not happy. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes because you will be on your feet most of your shift. They did give out free lunch from time to time.
bad,"I would arrive there on time but as a newly hired worker would not completely understand the system of way they did things so I would be absolutely lost once I'd be left alone, which happened very much. Though I did work my hardest to get things done."
bad,"This is a horrible place to work for. I worked there for 2 years and haven't had the opportunity to cross train and work other jobs in the store even though I was a ""team player"" and I did more than my job."
bad,crab in  a barrel atmosphere etl look to get bounses from firing team leaders and most team leaders are not given the chance to grow due to etls looking to promote inconstant team members
bad,"This job was a mess from the beginning, not only did they, ""forget,"" the day of my interview so the HR manager had to come in. Once the job started it was rough, long hours, very very low pay, raises at target are $0.10 annually if you're lucky. many people didn't get raises at all. Except for the managers getting their 4 digit bonuses of course. "
bad,The management at this Target is very poor. The store manager plays favorites and doesn’t want to know everyone that works for him. Most managers talk about you and look for ways to get you in to trouble or fire you. When you call in sick or are not feeling well certain mangers will say you are faking it.
bad,"It is something for someone in high school, not something for someone looking for career advancement or even to make connections. Not for college students either."
bad,"Very little praise by bosses. The benefits barely exist. It's impossible to get a decent raise, and the company cares more about its precious store than the employees who bust their butts to make the store run."
bad,"Absolutely no seniority in this company! People that are new making more than people who have been there for years! Fast, fast, fast!!! Expect humanly impossible work!  No matter how hard you work, how long you stay....means nothing! They use, use, use and then throw you away! Seems to like hiring very young people who they can intimidate and ram around. Gets rid of good people for no reason. Managers turn on each other to save their job....seen it!!! Overall...horrible place to work!!!"
bad,It was the worst place I've ever worked. Nobody cared about the employees that worked for them and when I was fired they made me work my whole shift and a hour before the shift ended they let me go. Too much work in too little time with too little pay. NOT fun at all.
bad,typical day consisted of cashiering and customer service. AS well as stocking shelves and price checking items for guests. Management was not fair with the hours and often helped others a lot more then fellow employees. the hardest part of the job was figuring out how to get more hours.  the most enjoyable part would have to be the fellow workers we had.
bad,"Racist...I'm white it would sicken me to see half dozen white employees working in toys while minorities were working in a different section."
bad,Come in to work for 3 hours but make us leave under 3 hour mark. 2 hours and half an hour before getting to the 3rd hour mark. Use favoritism in the work place not treating the hard workers fairly.
bad,I believe I found myself in a unique situation where working for Starbucks through a corporate location and a licensed location was too stressful to me. I could have moved to another department but I would always end up in the licensed store since they knew I was trained.
bad,I worked at Target for 93 days. I got wrongly fired when the higher ups told me to give a discount to the first to make them happy. Managers are never clear and give you different directions. They will blame you for things that they never made clear. They will make you feel like you are in the wrong and can never move higher up in the company. Worst experience with Target. Won't ever work there again or shop there.
bad,Management isn't good. No room for developing unless you play their games. Have no job security. They also don't abide by their own policies. They also don't give sick days without getting in trouble
bad,"Horrible place to work. They work the employees like slaves and offer no incentive or appreciation for them. They schedule you all kinds of crazy hours, one night your closing the next day you work early morning."
bad,"I worked at target during the whole unisex bathroom thing, and I basically worked 1-2 days a week. The older employees felt that it was okay to make the newer employees do all the work and it was overall just a bad experience."
bad,"They had someone train me for just 3 hours and it was not enough. When I was working as a cashier, they put me under pressure to sell or promote their credit card where I made a big mistake and ended up not charging a customer for the items they walked out with. They walked out without paying for the items."
bad,Target was ok the first couple of months I was there because I was unaware of how terrible the management was They stand around and talk and when you ask them a question they catch an attitude like your bothering them or they act like your stupid they walk around on there phone and they dont help at all. I wouldn’t refer this job to ANYONE it’s stressfu and it’s bad no advancement no hours managers have huge favoritism the whole establishment is a JOKE.
bad,"There are only a handful of good teamleaders. The manager at my location was horrible and couldn't keep track of anything. Nobody did their job right, which made doing my job a lot harder. Employees are taken advantage of and then criticized for taking sick days. The team leads are constantly on vacation. Not to mention most of the team members are rude."
bad,"Initially responsible for management of loss prevention team and store shortage and safety, job changed to simply becoming a store retail manager.  Superiors were not supportive, manipulative and dishonest.  Learn how to play the game here or you will be mulch.  Was not compensated fairly even by companies own guidelines, work life balance did not exist."
bad,"Working at Target was horrible, the pay wasn't that good. We had to work overnight and only had two fifteen minute breaks. Management was terrible and didn't listen to employee complaints."
bad,This company no longer exists. My employment was brief and I was a team leader in the electronics department. My job was simple and I never got the time to meet people.
bad,"a typical day at work would consist of the LOD yelling at you to basically clean up everything that's been thrown on the floor. I get it, it's your job, but what do they do? Nothing. I learned that I hate working in retail, which is sad cause I thought it would be an enjoyable workplace."
bad,"Its ok not great not bad, supervisors suck, show favortisism at all times, pay was not to my liking..couldn't really move up unless you were liked and vocal"
bad,"worked at target for a couple months and was miserable the entire time. The way the store was ran was horrible, pretty much had people slaving for basically low pay."
bad,"it was alright i like the people i worked with everything about the place was nice, people where nice the work wasnt to hard and i made alot of friends"
bad,Target is Horrible Avoid at All Cost. The majority of the managers are horrible and incompetent. They value a-- kissing and social interaction more than hard work. If you have any other job options besides target take them.
bad,Very unprofessional place. The managers have favorites. They arent flexible and dont care about their employees at all. They are very over bearing and unprofessional.
bad,"If you love serving yuppy rich white people who treat you like trash, Target is the employer for you! It will simultaneously crush your soul and steal all the hope you had left in humanity."
bad,this job was hard and was not maneaged the people were not nice and long hours couldnt stay awake felt like being in a gym all day long didnt know what they weere doing felt like prison couldnt neve leave
bad,Target was an awful place to work. The manager treated the employees like garbage and overworked us. There's  a reason turnover is as high as it is. It's because of the manager.
bad,I would just go in and organize the store push everything forward whatever someone returned put it back. It was really slow and just not a fast enough pace for my likings.
bad,not got anyhting to say at this company is no longer trading. they were taken over by city link who are also no longer trading. They were losing too much money
bad,Nice team members but poor management. Great place to help guest but no chance to advance to a higher position or work hours. Good experience to learn.
bad,Management consisted of 21-25 year old kids straight out of college.  They did not know how to do most jobs in the store and most of them had never worked for Target before.  The older team members would be harassed while the younger ones would never be told anything.  If you were older than 30 you would have no chance to move up in the company.
bad,Management at this Target location was just terrible. They were constantly pushing more for the stores red card quota. They never cared about their employees. They never took interest in our wellbeing.
bad,"horrid company. Terrible communication. Terrible management. Terrible organization. Work changed from 5 people per team, 3-4 teams at once working the floor, then it changed to 1 person per team, 1-2 teams at any given time for the entire sales floor. Then that huge hack happened. Genius."
bad,"this place was not enjoyable, it was long shifts that and very very exhausting. each time that I worked the percentages that we had to hit and the managers harped on you over and over without training you any further"
bad,"management has very little idea of what goes on around them, some of the management are intelligent, but have little to no people skills. They have a very difficult time leading a group of experienced workers"
bad,Management never seemed to be on the same page about anything other than blaming entry level team members for their mistakes. Very hostile work environment.
bad,"Walmart is better staffed sadly , management is very argumentative and non understanding , disrespectful and screams at employees  very unprofessional"
bad,It was all fine until you get hurt on the job. Then you are treated like an outsider put on light duty which consists of picking up trash. There are some good people that work there. But overall there are a lot of backstabbing gong on. Beware of this place.
bad,The manager didn't care what you do at work and you can do anything you want at work. They were chill and didn't do anything for the staff. I didn't even worked.
bad,"Speak to each guest in a positive and friendly manner and always put them first.		"
bad,"pushed carts all day long, no training, never challenged, asked to be trained on equipment,lack of mangement, treated poorly, didn't feel comfortable wasn't happy at work."
bad,"Provide guidance and support to staff to perform their duties effectively "
bad,Was told full time. Hours never made full time. Fast pace some real challenges in zoning shelf's. Management never would address workers concerned and avoided all verbal contact with individuals.
bad,"not a good place to work at all, they never have hours to give and will string you along with talks of promotion. the slowest laziest workers get promoted."
bad,"cashier , sale to the customer, excellent customer service, team player, willing to learn, no room for error, accurate cash transactions , greet the customer"
bad,I worked at Target as a cashier and sales floor. I would check people out as fast and friendly as I could. I also would make sure that the clothes were nice and neat on the racks.
bad,"Was fun working part time hours with ok pay. Loved working in backroom or unloading trucks, just not enough hours or too many hours with stupid work that had nothing to do with your title."
bad,"Cramming four jobs into one job with full accountability. Managers are young desk jockeys. They really believe in Communism and it's disguised as ""One Team"" philosophy."
bad,"Target has no empathy and soul. the target i worked at was robbed and they just swept it under the rug. workers are overwworked and underpaid. management isnt willing to help with anything."
bad,Really bad management. No room for advancement. They will expect you todo your job and then get mad at you when you go over your scheduled hours. I would recommend people NOT work for them
bad,"Poorly managed and very cut throat"
bad,Managers were mostly there due to having family ties and lacked the proper character and skills to be in said positions. The pay was very poor and the scheduling was done with very short notice.
bad,"I did not like working at Target. The workload was easy, but the management took advantage of their authority. They were unfair, and just cruel people."
bad,Management all hangs out together all day like they are a high school clique. They raise their minimum wage just to cut hours because they can't afford it. you get a 10 percent discount but only if you pay with cash or the target red card  not your regular debit or credit card.
bad,"If your a teen just trying to get your first job then it's an acceptable place to work."
bad,I currently work there and I have not seen so many people quit in such a short time. The management is horrible. It feels like a prison. I have gotten yelled at for just standing a certain way.
bad,"·	Demonstrate products, and explain product features"
bad,Target like's to pretend like it is the upscale version of Walmart that treats its employees right and is a wonderful team culture to work for. It is not and my experience was anything but inspiring. The store I worked at alone had 6 changes in leadership at all levels in less than 2 years. I trained at-least 15 people for the same position because the wise leaders at the top kept removing people before that had a chance to do anything making my life and their's a nightmare.
bad,"It was a terrible unorganized experience. I did not enjoy the overnight hours and the team was very much clueless and it was painful, hard unfun work."
bad,target was a pain the management had attitude and were rude nothing was never organized right it was always a mess i hated working there only nice thing i got from target was the friends i made
bad,"you get 10% off your purchase as a discount. pretty cool, huh? no. anywho the world is your oyster, if you have to read reviews about the company from ex employees then its nit for you."
bad,Very stressful job. mostly bending over and lifting items for an entire shift. Managers would get annoyed if you used the restroom more than once per shift.
bad,"Working there was worse then being in highschool. Management was very rude and inconsiderate. Customer service could be improved, but they were very great with volunteer events. Provided lunch for employees on every holiday. Overallimproved recommend working for this company"
bad,"applied because i needed money. manager didn't know what to do,  stressed and took it out on employees. was promised manager position for a year never got it"
bad,Working at target was horrible. You get screamed at for things completely out of your control. The hours and pay are very low and the management doesn't care about you in the slightest.
bad,"Working at Target has been one of the worst, if not the worst places I have ever worked at in my life. Management was constantly playing favorites and treating the good employees badly. You were expected to know more than what you were getting paid for and they push the red cards down your throat. Their was nothing enjoyable about this job whatsoever."
bad,"Management was very unfair and poorly run. Favoritism was a huge factor. Not flexible or understanding, rude, and underpaid. Staff was very ""mean girl"" and ""highschool""."
bad,The kennesaw target had poor management. And no overtime no one ever came in to work when they needed to. Nothing was ever well put together. Everything was going downhill fast.
bad,"Target pharmacy no longer exists, it was sold to CVS, CVS is a very terrible place to work for. I was part time (around 8 hours) due to having another job. They forced me to sign up for their insurance so my paycheck was 2$ (I even worked extra that week due to training) and they wouldn't cancel the insurance nor give me my money back."
bad,"they are very mean, disrespectful, don't like to give hours. customers are also very rude. The pay isnt enough for the amount of labor they EXPECT you to do. no chance of advancement"
bad,Stay far away from Target and don't even entertain the idea of working for this company. Poor management because of young kids put in higher positions than they should be and a whole lot more.
bad,very stressful no communication they have their favorites in team members they fire people from left to right really for no reason I feel as though they need to hire better team leaders
bad,They're currently being sued for under cutting their employees. its an okay place to work they need to train their employee more for the stress that they put on them.
bad,one of the worst places to work.  They want to train you in as many areas as possible but never give you anything for it.  I did manager duties but was never made a manager.
bad,Stereotypical low-income employee store that worries more about profits than employees. It will take years in order to properly move unless management likes you.
bad,"I enjoyed the work. It was fast paced but I liked it. The downside is that hours were cut, resulting in layoffs. I was supposed to begin training on learning how to work the line and to be trained on learning how to drive a fork lift but they never taught me and kept me unloading trucks until they laid me off."
bad,This location needs more mature management that can provide fair practices across the board. They set unrealistic goals and fault you when you are unable to complete the tasks. They are consistently unethical and only provide work hours to their favorites.
bad,"Bad management, really bad management. Not fair at all. If you have other choices do not work here. They only take care of their own. People who work there need hours but never get any, instead they hire more new. But if you know someone there and it's in management, u sure will get treat good. They don't pay same money even you are in same position join the team at same time."
bad,expect you to stay and do more work but no extra compensation.  unrealistic expectations.  in my store there were clicks and it was not easy to keep everything professional.
bad,this was the worst 10 years of my life. i would not recommend working here unless your a child and just need some extra cash. this place was very stressful and they always want you to ask people to apply for a target credit card
bad,they raise there standards to high for the day. that is why they were never allowed to stay. They do not know how to treat there employees. They dont understand that people need to go school.
bad,"Beware of this place..."
bad,"I liked my coworkers, the company itself has a strange business model. They would have hiring events and then cut everyone's hours. I worked for long hours in the freezer."
bad,The Managers think they are GOD and you are a ant. The work is easy but it takes time to do the job right but the managers don't want to give you the time it takes. They make you do there jobs in the backroom and get mad if you say no its your job. They give you way more then one person can handled. Don't Work Here!
bad,"Managers care far more about the store looking good than actually functioning well. They only make an attempt to fully staff work centers during fourth quarter, and often not even then. Regular Team Leads and below are overworked and consistently understaffed. If you're good at your job despite all that, your reward is doing other people's work for them."
bad,"They mislead you and tell you one thing to get you hired then reality that the position is a stocker.  They need to tell the applicant what the position really consists of. No matter how fast you work they keep telling you ""you will have to work faster"".  Not the way the company used to be at all.  It is all young people running this company"
bad,"no acknowledge for completing tasks on time no respect or manager integrity, and the hardest part of my job at target was going above and beyond and being unoticed by all managers"
bad,this job wasn't the greatest job I worked in. The management was very poorly and the hours that they gave us wasn't great and pay wasn't either. I wont recommend anybody to work there
bad,Not happy  because they play favorites and they also don't have ethics sometimes they don't give you break and forget about who needs break and the also need more training
bad,"Target was a very unbearable place to work. Management was rude and unforgiving to sickness or personal issues, and although scheduling was flexible, getting requested days off was rare."
bad,"Disgruntled managers who nit pick at everything and think they're so great,(they're not). They think they own you."
bad,Would not recommend to anyone. Built upon lies. Terrible magement. Over worked. Breaks never were authorized when legally mandatory. Companies policies are based upon lies. Corporate doesn't follow thru.
bad,Would not recommend to a friend or anyone looking for serious work. The management is very quick to point fingers and not take blame for improperly training employees.
bad,"Training was a joke, front end supervisors would take an hour to bring change, and just the idiocy of it all was too stressful.  I was given maybe a day notice of them ending my time there, so that was a fun New Year's bit of news!"
bad,Store side is a place where souls go wither and die.  There is no work life balance and most of the other leaders are robotic and drone like.  This is a place to avoid.
bad,Not a great place to work. Constantly under the gun. Rules are strict and most are unrealistic. They actually want you to fail. Hard work is not rewarded.
bad,This place was one way.  A lot of leadership problems. Not to many verity of people working . didn't like it or the feel of   the people working there
bad,"hated working there as well, pay sucked, i was there for almost 7 years and still made only 10 dollars an hr, i would never recommended target to anyone. management was horrible."
bad,Very bad place to work. The company treats you with disrespect. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. The only thing good was flexible schedules. Wouldn't recommend anyone wages suck
bad,Horrible place starting from management to sales floor workers  severely understaffed and most shifts had to take on work the required four to five people and was required to complete said work b shift end or would get reprimanded
bad,The management when I was there was so full of themselves that I got injured by a manager.And then they wanted doctors notes so they did not read them and then ask why you were doing what you're doctor told you to do.
bad,Management sucked poried work at the one on south chase in Milwaukee Wisconsin I like first but. I really disliked management poried they would play favoritism and i seen people get treat unfairly many times
bad,"When i worked at target i always kept to myself, and didn't bother anyone. I did my work then went on my way. For some reason all the workers were so rude to me, everytime i walked by i get mean stares, everytime i ask a question i get snobby replies. I would not recommend this job to anyone. Grown people should not be bullying others!"
bad,Walmart pays more and actually has better benefits. Which is awful considering how bad Walmart's wages and benefits are. Target likes to pretend to be so much better but the employees are treated horribly.
bad,Target has gone from a company who truly values its employees and their families to a money hungry corporation who could most definitely care less about you and your family. Worst place ive ever worked.
bad,"Expect to do 3 or 4 people's jobs at a barely above minimum wage. After you prove your worth, they cut your hours unless they need you to work a ridiculous schedule at Christmas time."
bad,The job itself is not rewarding. You are required to multitask at nonhuman levels all while not being acknowledged for your work. Moving up is also almost nonexistent because of the high-school like culture this place breeds.
bad,its ok. pay is minimum. the hours are good and they are pretty flexible when it comes to vaction so long as its not during peak times like christmas thanksgiveing or back to school
bad,a typical few hours at work and not a very good safe work issues. Management all right. Moving products out to store from trucks was a  good thing. I like to work hard the whole time.
bad,"My job in mobile wasn't through target specifically but they oversaw my department. Most of their managers arent aware of their own corporate policies, and have little sense of true customer service."
bad,Overnight shifts require unloading truck shipments with thousand of inventory and there are multiple trucks each week. Afterwards you must stock the shelves before 6:45am but if the unloading process took longer than usual you are rushed and yelled at to hurry up. Not a job I would ever do again or recommend.
bad,"They don't give enough hours for the work that they  for the company was ok for a part time job."
bad,"If you're cashier, you're actually going to be helping clean up the store at night and you will stay late. If you're salesfloor, you're also cart attendant and a lot of other stuff that's not in your job description. I worked here for 5 years, you don't do the job you're signed up for. Target was the worst experience ever."
bad,backroom team member is the hardest position at Target. Supervisors always put pressure on us to do miracles. The raise is a joke even if you are the best employee. It depends on the person who does your assessment. When it is slow they give you few hours and they call you when they need you. The only thing that I appreciate at Target is some team members who are hard working but nobody give them what they deserve.
bad,"Excellent training and employee treatment. Management worked well with me on my part time hours and I absolutely loved working the holiday rushes, especially Christmas."
bad,It is a terrible place to work.  They are very cold and non-responsive to customer needs.  They do not know their own products and cannot find items.  You have to go in and do it yourself.
bad,Majority of employees are classified as part-time with less than 20hrs a week to keep them from getting medical coverage. They only take care of management personel and will promote butt kissers regardless if they are on final notice for termination before someone who is hard working.
bad,Anything else is better the people are always involved in drama which makes it seem like if you are back in high school. All the managers are not caring because if there is an issue they would rather fire you or make you quit instead of dealing with anyone.
bad,What a terrible company to work for. Get assigned a task and then punished for working internal on a boss's friend. Horrible management. AP Team is cowards. STL's are poor.
bad,Never a good day to work there. The only good thing about working there was leaving and quitting. The team lead in electronics was a horrible person and manager.
bad,Don't work at target don't care bout team members especially that target in college Point this is the Worst place to work at no benefits what so ever worst
bad,"I had a terrible experience working at Target.  This summer I was getting sick quite alot and my transportation wasnt always reliable (Texas heat kept doing a number on the car).  The managers weren't understanding and if you leave early from work because you're throwing up, it counts as an absence and goes against you.  Only two managers are actually good there and the rest are horrible and vindictive.  They would have me closing 4-5 departments a night while only making everyone else close 1-2.  The only good part was that every once in a while they gave us ice cream or food for doing good that week."
bad,If you like to cut hours to maximize profit then Target is the company for you. High turnover rate which makes your job essentially a team trainer. Would not recommend.
bad,"I left verizon wireless to go to a new department target was opening, Target Mobile, i became a store manager and was lied to about my pay and commission structure."
bad,didn't really like working here we are way underpaid and really overworked. especially when you have an entire football field to fold and only three people working on a weekend.
bad,when I first started I was never trained they put me on a register and that was my training. you have to talk customers into getting a red card and make sure your register is tidy and clean. you do work with some awesome people.
bad,Executives/managers are all 19-23 year old graduates put in postions that give them power trips. They rotate these executives every 18 months into different stores depending on their performance. If you don't do well in your department that include hours being cut and added work all the time the district managers and the store manager will make you quit or fire you eventually. High turn around for sure and now the company expects part time team members to be experts in the departments without proper pay while doing everything from a-z.
bad,I really have nothing positive to say  .Very poor training . Manager was something out of a nightmare .Very large turnover . Team members were helpful but nervous
bad,"Basically I worked overstock graveyards hours but the worst part was I and several others employees spent all our time restock over stock items and finding places to throw back in the back stock because purchasing was a bunch of idiots. Listing to music was a privallge to them.  Management was horrible no help at all,no training so I basically worked 4 days for free with no pay because they didn't punch my paper right. So calling BBB, but I had to prove it. ."
bad,i was hired at a new store and when they had to many people they cut my hours down to 6 hours one day a week i cannot take care of my family with that low pay
bad,"Horrible place to work! They cut hours constantly and leave you short handed to make ""budget."" In other words, money for the stock holders and investors. But YOU still have all the normal work to do.  That's why there are so many empty registers!! They send everyone home.cut hours and yank people off the sales floor stocking and cleaning, to ring register when it gets too busy, Then they expect us to double time and get everything done. All at low pay and NO recognition."
bad,"When I first was hired, I was told that I was being hired for a second level job that I would receive after 90 days.   I did not get that.  I watched a company that went from very customer oriented, to a very bottom line oriented view."
bad,The management  wants team members to work like robots and have no fun at all. They want the work done and if you have to stay past your shift they make it hard to leave. Plus  give you no help at all so it made it hard to get it all done. Plus favoritism  to some of  the women. Men  harassment to the women   and the management  looks   the other way.
bad,"The management team at target is poor at best. Team members are given little regard, treated poorly overworked and underpaid. Team members are given mountains of work and unrealistic expectations."
bad,"Horrible, wouldn't recommend to anyone. It was got in the beginning until I caught scabies from the chula vista, Palomar store.Then management started treating me different because I started to complain about it."
bad,"working at target made me realize what a horrible  job retail was. Never working for retail every again . Co workers just love favoritism , and drama . NOT FOR ME"
bad,"The management passes along their stress, makes for a poor environment to work. Managment talks down to you instead of positive reinforcement. Every work night was stressful."
bad,"target is one of the worst place to work. They don't give enough hours and they don't work with your school schedule. always asking for a miracle and don't pay nor give enough hours to finish the job. management sucks, they never work. They always walk around and do nothing.  worst leader in retail."
bad,Managers suck. Suck at scheduling overall not a happy place to work at they are always low on people & they never want to schedule enough people. Always expect other departments to go back up cashier.
bad,"Target is the type of company that does not promote within rather look for other outside sources. Not to fair when it comes to raises, although there is room for opportunity. Hard work is often overlooked and you end up being more of a slave then feeling like and actual team member. Don't waste 5 years of your life thinking what do I have to show for it!"
bad,While this company looked like a great fit from the outside it was far from ideal. The managers were constantly being let go or transferred from my store. When we did have a department manager We the employees were training them on our jobs and how things run in the store.
bad,"Working here was a pretty cool job but as far as management and team leaders , they don't know the proper way to talk to people and handle situations concerning team members."
bad,"this is the worst company to work for all higher managers stick together and have each others backs. they smile in your face and talk behind your back. you'll be lucky to make it out your 90 because they will find any reason to get rid of you if they don't like you, and don't try to go to HR about because then they will defiantly be on you.Overall target was the worst place I've worked in my life they never give you good feed back its always bad"
bad,Store managers inspired no good work ethics. The sales floor environment was stale and dark. The workers were just as dull as the mangers who managed them.
bad,I was hired in as a temp employee during the winter season. I was given horrible hours and absolutely no respect. During my orientation I was also promised a full position after my internship which they didn't give me violating a verbal contract.
bad,management and team leaders scream and cuss at employees terrible hours and they will never let you get enough hours for any sort of benefits. I don't recommend any one ever work for this company
bad,"worst mistake I've made In a long time was working for this company, management is extremely disrespectful, my team leader would literally scream and cuss at employees. you will never get the hours promised to you upon hiring. benefits are nonexistent and if you even get close to enough hours to qualify for them they will make sure and cut your hours. long story short I do not recommend any one ever work for this company unless they have no self respect what so ever."
bad,"Shift work. Hard to advance. Managers are kind of bad. Customer service, so Its sometimes hard to deal with the people. other workers were fun to work with."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to apply at Target, The management is very inexperienced and have absolutely no clue as to be effective, remember there is more to being a manager than the bottom line. You have to strive constantly to achieve customer and employee satisfaction, they have failed on both and I gave them every chance to get it right."
bad,"I have never worked somewhere with such horrible leadership in the highest roles. It's true what they say about promoting to failure. Once they get there, they fail and target pays them more. Horrible."
bad,"working for target was the worst. I worked every front end position there was, including food production. The customers were rude and demanding and the managers had no sympathy for any kind of problem that occurred. You were always at fault, not the ""guest"". In the end I quit over the stress and anxiety, because it was making me physically ill. They wouldn't give breaks and expected you to work without what is legally required. there is total disregard for the starbucks staff and zero help from management, who yell at you for not producing drinks fast enough, then yell at you after you finally stand still a moment after finishing cleaning. Just total hypocrites and heathens. Useless and uncaring. They just want you to work, and then quit, so they don't have to give you that 5 cent raise at the end of the year. I also tried to commit suicide in one store's bathroom because my manager was so ruthless and mean to me."
bad,"i would never work for target again. it just wasn't for me. The people the vibe, it was to much to handle. I mean its a minimum wage job and they expect you to above and beyond without ever been compensated for doing an excellent job. "
bad,"Managers do not care about workers. Short breaks, low pay. Stressful job. Standing on your feet will get you really tired and in body pain. No room for growth. Discount suck."
bad,"This has to be the worst experience working in retail that I have ever had.First off, the store management was the biggest group of back-stabbers I have ever come across. They would say one thing and then do another. They never listened and were incredibly sensitive to suggestions. If you even hinted at possibly doing anything different then the exact textbook way, corrective action (CCA). They would go out of their way to make your life miserable, and would constantly stick you with the worst task. The turnover rate was outrageously high because of this. In the three years I worked there, people quit and got fired left and right.This is T2259 by the way."
bad,"The area I worked in wasn't fun, and the LOD was horrible and super rude all the time, at multiple times i tried to befriend her and she ended up firing me."
bad,"I worked here for almost a year and I can honestly say it was the worst job, they expect too much and don't give you any time off. I had an important wedding to do to but said I couldn't because too many people had that day off but I asked around and no one had that weekend off. Target  needs to  change its management"
bad,Target had the potential to be fantastic but didn't get to have that change when it was shut down. It was all about the money which I understand but they moved too fast and it didn't take off as quickly as the upper management wanted it to.
bad,"Target Bee Cave is the worst place to work. Management along with HR, STL,and ETL are selfish and ungrateful. Theres poor communication between team members and leaders."
bad,Typical day at work I go in go to the floor work the merchandise restock it on shelves. What I have learned as the years I worked at Target is that the team leads have your back. Management needs to be more organized. The workplace culture at Target is pretty easy-going the team-mates we all get along crack jokes we have a little fun. Will the hardest part of the job would be that management needs to say one thing instead of saying another thing and mean what they mean. The most enjoyable part of the job is going to work every morning and seeing your work mates your team-mates.
bad,Racist towards people of color. Shows favoritism to select employees. Doesn't promote based off work but off of who they like. Fires all the African American employees to replace them with Hispanic or White
bad,"Target Tech is great for an entry level member of the workforce, but there is no room for growth or a career here. Unrealistic expectations and quotas, with minimum wage compensation, and the absolute worst type of commission structure. Also, you spend 80% of your time doing targets work, even though you are an employee of a  completely different company."
bad,"Don't even bother , in 6 months you'll be cycled through like the rest of the morons who chose to work for this evil corporation. No matter how hard you work it's never good enough the management will find something to pick on you for."
bad,during lunch it is very loud. there is a lot of favoritism and not a lot of hours giving out. too many fights and picking on. adults do not know how to communicate amoung themselves.
bad,"Hate it! I will never work there again. They were the worst at everything. The manager was sexist and rude, my coworkers would only speak in Spanish and weren't very nice or helpful."
bad,"company sucks and does not support workers, always under staffed and managers want you to do multiple jobs outside the documented job discriptions without any extra pay."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working there, most people quit within a month or two. it was a negative environment and the management was terrible especially on the front end."
bad,I unload the trucks and stock the product on the shelves. They don't treat the workers that great. I unload the truck everyday I work. I love helping people out they can always come to me for anything
bad,The management at  the time when I work there was horrible and unorganized. They hired a lot of people at once and started firing for no reason. Don't apply.
bad,"Managers never check on you to make sure that you understand the work they throw you in to. Refuse to work with your schedule for people who are in school, even when they were warned beforehand. Pay not that great either."
bad,nothing more needed it wass a very stressful environment young managers are very disrespectful i wouldn't tell a homeless person to work there. You will never get promoted unless you are with their click
bad,"	Ensure the safety and supervision of children during transport to schools, field trips, and other locations as approved by the Center Director"
bad,"Target is a great place to shop, but not to work. The co-workers are amazing and you will feel like part of the family but management is very political and the hours are not consistent"
bad,Stressful and a very bad environment management had its picks on who was going to have every other weekend off and who was gone work didnt enjoy anything about this job
bad,"just put out stock, i learned nothing and feel tht management was bad, the work culture was good hard part was working 3rd shift and the easy part it was a slow moving job"
bad,"if you are a grown up who needs to pay bills don't even think about it, I would say target is more for kids in high school or someone who doesn't have bills to pay or responsibilities. you're not given the opportunity to grow here, management has always their favorites who they give the hours to and are always cutting hours so they can get their bonus. the raise they give to their employees is a joke. there's always gossip within the store, there's no confidentiality here, anything discussed with a leader or HR will come out of the office. benefits for employees are being reduced or changed each year. all management cares about is cutting hours, having a clean store and back room, making sales and having everything ""under control"" for when they have visits from the big boss, no one cares about the employees."
bad,Unless your a special employee you get treated like junk and then they come up with a excuse to get rid of you the pay you hourly pay and you give them production work
bad,"Was hired to work in elect, did well there other in the fact the areas level 3 never heard of a bath. The store management would shop on store hours and would then later yell at the staff of not helping them shop"
bad,Working at target  is hard.  You will meet people who are mean but you just have to ignore it. They pay  they pay good good. Work hard and never give up.
bad,Run.. don't walk away from this company and this specific warehouse. You are worked like a dog to meet quota and those that don't are released. Upper and lower management have trouble remember employees names as they don't care to learn it with all that they replace.
bad,I wasted four years of my life at target only to see people who did not know policy move up and people who were always late or rude be put in better positions even had a manager who hired people so he had girls to date the worst retail experience of my life. Granted could have been this store was just so bad but not much hope considering i have seen similar traits at other stores.
bad,The work was stressful physically. I did not appreciate the way I was treated by the management in Target. Pay was horrible. Hours wasn't the greatest (limited)
bad,Working for target is ok but looking for something esle I can't do other stuff then register like to work in soft lines or hard lines anything but regsiter
bad,Target purposely keeps employee's at part time so they do not qualify for full time benefits. Managers are rude and under-trained. The pay does not compensate the amount of work employee's do.
bad,"favoritism, childish groups of people that are lazy and don't want to work. management is horrible and they only promote people if they like you and are apart of their clicks/circle. They don't care how hard and good of a worker you are. And if you don't associate within their circles and kiss their behinds, they will find something to let you go. the workload and pay is not worth it. I wasted all most two years with them and can't get that back. DON'T WORK FOR TAGET NO WHERE!!!!!!!"
bad,"Target was not a bad place to work at but with the managers only caring about themselves and only liking certain workers, it was hard to have a good day at work."
bad,"While I was there, all they cared about was the company credit card. Your hours would get cut if you didn't get enough people to sign up for them. Hard to feel good about your job when you're putting people in debt."
bad,"Target literally is what inspired me to go back to school because the people I worked with were awful, with the exception of a few general managers. Other than that, I would not recommend working there."
bad,I decided to quit working for Target due to Management allowing guests to call me derogatory names in front of everyone. This happened multiple times. And when I asked to move departments due to harassment they said no. Overall great place to shop terrible place to work.
bad,Horrible job culture and no room for growth and advancement.  Management is poor and horrible company values.  They do not value their employees.  On a typical day at work they have you doing multiple job duties that are out of your job description.
bad,"I dealt with customers, checked them out, and dealt with money. I also had to organize, clean and merchandise. The management needs a lot of work because they do not understand reasonable and unreasonable expectations and reality. I enjoyed working with most of the other associates, The hardest part of the job was having to deal with what management wanted or expected. Also not having a set schedule was extremely difficult."
bad,been there 2 years and saw 3 different store team leads.rude customers and management. they wrote us up if we had our phones in our pocket . they said our phones are to be in our locker.
bad,"Management are rude and don't care about your life outside of work."
bad,"Local branches operated too much by corporate overlords, in my opinion.  Local management tries hard but common sense does not live here, because of corporate rules."
bad,Target will over work their employees even when they are ill. Management had has favorites that they will do special favors for. Target does no have a flexible schedule to work around daily life of others.
bad,"I really wish that I could say anything positive about working here. The upper management only cares about kissing the a of their higher ups. I can't even count on all of my fingers and toes how many times my attempt at improving employee morale was shot down. Some of the management did have their employees in their best interests, and to them, I say thank you. Working here was an enjoyable experience because of you. "
bad,When I first started woring for target I loved it. We were closing down and the manager that came to take over i felt was very raciest. He always picked on certain employees.
bad,"I would say it was a good job, just had poor management at the time. Worked really hard at the job and because a manager didn't approve of me staying, I was let go."
bad,i really liked working for target in the begening. but the mangers have disrepect for there employee. they dont let you move up in the job or train in any other area like they said they would.i did meet alot of great friends. customer would complain how the mangers were treating there employees
bad,"Retail sales like any retail store, you have to be willing to work nights and weekends, be flexible in job- cashiering, customer service, etc. Black Friday and holidays get crazy!"
bad,"I put in my application and they called back in less than 24 hours. I got an interview scheduled, went to the interview and it was probably 5 minutes long and they asked stupid questions that had nothing to do with working. And emailed me 2 weeks later and said they were unable to offer me any positions. This was the 2nd time they've done this."
bad,"My day at work here would consist of maintaining a fast check put time, customer service,assist the management team of there duties,Guest service returns, Order pick-up, returns stock back to floor, maintain a clean an safe work place daily"
bad,"My experience at target has been nothing but annoying! Management sucks and the employees suck as well. They show favoritism and you won't get any hours. Prices are too high! And there is never enough cashiers at work so that means the cafe team member has to help! There is never any help in the cafe when there are big rushes and the food is way overpriced, 2.93 for one hot dog when you can buy a whole pack! Target doesn't care about their employees period. I hated the job PERIOD! If I could give negative stars I would. Nothing nice about the place but when you get to clock out and go home :)"
bad,Horrible. Biggest raises in pay came after Walmart would raise theirs. Turn over rate for team is extremely high...  but not for management. They also have an illegal system in place for yearly reviews.
bad,"From my account, I was working by myself at the busiest times of the day. There was so much to in so little time. Some night were great, but most nights were bad."
bad,Not up to date with current technology at all.  Training program was a joke and employees were asked to help with tasks that were not pharmacy related.
bad,People are horrible and cause nothing but drama. They are uneducated lazy people on power trips. They play the blame game and treat the employees like dogs.
bad,"Run, run! Do not apply for this Target in Pearland. Horrible management.  They expected you to ALWAYS be available to work even if you already made plans around the schedule that was given at the beginning of the work week.  They expected you to stock a heavy truck of merchandise with the least amount of staff and then not appreciated your hard work. Management doesn't walk store to see who is actually working and who is not.  Too many employees just standing around doing nothing while others were doing all of the work. RUN!"
bad,Management does not provide adequate moral or encouragement. I do not feel they give team members the opportunity to grow or move up as they should. Management does not do well in keeping employees motivated at work.
bad,while the upper management tends to stick to them selfs. the team leads are the real heros of your store. alot of they time the Team leads are under payed and over worked for the type of work they are asked to do. and the ETL's get all the reward of the Team leads and team members hard work. its a form of trickle down economics. as we all know tickle down economics doesn't work when the people getting the rewards are greedy
bad,"It was always pretty stressful coming to work here. I loved all my coworkers, but management was very childish or treated full grown adults like children."
bad,"If you're a teenager it might be a fine place to work. Otherwise I would not recommended it for a long-term career. Terrible pay, and terrible benefits."
bad,I did not enjoy working at Target due to management. Manager was very unprofessional she'd played a lot of favoritism with certain team members. I would not recommend people to apply at Target.
bad,Not a great place to work! Only good thing is they will hire just about anybody with no career in mind.  I just want to get this done so I can post my job preferences! Uhg!
bad,Not good company to work for can't get ahead .they have there people picked.Don't  respect there employees disrespectfull don't talk to you like your a professional
bad,"Pay less, expect more is definitely Target's slogan not just for their guests but also for there employees. They pay the labor heavy workers so little and expect so much. The hours are almost crazy and the work environment can be riddled with unnecessary ""office"" politics and egg shells. Definitely a temporary job and NOT a career building place, unless you came in from the top."
bad,I seen too many people get fired for no reason when you get workman's comp they put a target on you and they will get rid of you as soon as they can they say that they care about their employees but they don't
bad,Good for young leaders to gain experience but expectations are unrealistic. Leadership is poor and lacks ability to provide consistent direction or accountability.
bad,target didnt have man yemployees to stay do to the management.  it was was mentally draining...i hope that they do better in the futeure.  but i did make some great friends.
bad,"I got hired as a seasonal employee for the Flow Team which was great and everything, no less than a month in i was offered to move to the Backroom with a raise in pay and a permanent job (no more seasonal), i said yes of course for stability. I initially asked for a job offer letter stating the offer, never got one and that was red flag number one. Hours would range from 35+ a week to next week your only scheduled 4 or 8!! I was scheduled seasonal until March 2017 but stop being scheduled in January, mind you I've already took a ""permanent"" position in the store in December 2016. Other seasonal employees were let go after a month of being hired also. This store will burn you out for their benefit, but if you try to benefit yourself and work around school this management will let you go. The management cannot be trusted and are sneaky. If you are looking for a place to work this certainly is not one of them keep looking and dont waste your time with this company at all! And watch out for how they start and end your pay period, because you will not be paid for X pay period but it will carry to the next pay period and the pay still wont add up."
bad,Ready to work hard and show everyone you can fill a better position? Yea well it wont matter here. Word as long and as hard as you want you will be used and then tossed to the side. They will tell you there is a promotion and dangle it in front of you and when it comes time....you wont get it.
bad,Not the best place to work.... They make you miserable always riding you about production even when your doing good. I'm glad I left
bad,"You never get a break from customers except in the break room. Working the cashiering aisle is easy, only takes 2 days to get up to speed, but when a problem comes up, mgmt is sometimes way in another part of the store, so you have to wait for a supervisor to appear. It can be fun, but it is Big Brother watching you all the time."
bad,"The lack of leadership has made this a really difficult place to work."
bad,"company is restructuring.  leads and supervisors are lazy and basically kids run all the stores. do not expect to make money or any overtime cheap pay and lousy discounts.decided to end the overnight shift in which they can not restock the store properly and basically caused hard ship for families that needed to work that shift . the bottom line is do not work here it is all smoke and mirrors."
bad,Horrible work experience; would never recommend to anyone. Very immature management hired without experience. Very difficult work environment.
bad,I worked with all kinds of people and enjoyed it.  The company had good customer service.  The management people were very easy to work with.  This job was a very good job and I enjoyed it.
bad,This Target in Rancho Cucamonga treats their employees like garbage and are very strict. There really is no room for advancement unless you are sucking up to management and you give up your personal life for this company. The pay and hours are bad and employees here will throw you under the bus if they need too. Management loves to retaliate every chance they get on you and when I gave my 2 weeks they did not want to give me a letter of recommendation just to get even. If you make a mistake here they will pull you in the backroom and give you a scolding of a lifetime. If you need work I do not recommend working here.
bad,"No work life balance, upper management doesn't know what they're doing. The store managers love to micromanage and they expect you to work 12 hour days while they leave early."
bad,"When I worked there, at first I was elated that I was put to permanent part time and I enjoyed the challenges of the fast paced atmosphere.  Team Leads and Management bounce around a lot, hence you must never show that you are smarter than any of them at your job or you will be harassed to tears and upper management is so goofy they have no clue on how to protect you.  You might be able to get trained in other areas if management either likes you or wants to set you up for a huge fall."
bad,I was hired as ELECTRONICS sales associate yet I couldn't even be near the electronics desk without getting yelled at to do every other job in the store.
bad,This place only caters to Mormons in this area. In a weeks time you can see who they cater to and who they give the worse jobs too. It's really a shame they do this. Had some great employees but when you speak up they really don't like it. Specially the male managers but female managers were almost the same. They tell you they will give you more hrs but that doesn't last long. The managers only think of themselves and so does the store manager.
bad,Ever since the new manager came in its been all bad they are letting go of empoylees left and right. Just hope im not next. Its like walking on egg shells. Management just cares about themselves where is the loyalty
bad,"The management is very bad they treat the employees badly, the supervisors didn't like a good employee as they feel threatened by him so they try to poorly recommend him , very disappointing experience,"
bad,None of the managers even do their jobs. When I worked there they were always on their phones. They wouldn't promote in store employees ever..? Work experience was horrid. Would no recommend working here unless you want a messed up schedule and leaders
bad,"I worked at Target for over a year in Starbucks and other departments. As time went on, things progressively got worse, mostly in Starbucks. We were constantly understaffed, a typical Starbucks has AT LEAST 4 people on hand at all times, we were lucky if we had 2. We were forced to work by ourselves during large rushes of people with NO help. They never had hours for us and even though we were always busy, they kept taking more hours from our department. I worked constantly, with only 1 day off (if I was lucky), because new employees would always quit in their first month. They expect you to do the job of 5 people and write you up if something isn't done. Management is absolutely awful. They don't care about your opinions or concerns, everything always gets overlooked. You're never thanked or appreciated for any of your hard work. They seem to think that putting new people in Team Lead positions is a good idea instead of employees who already work in that department, so long time employees are forced to train their managers. Their is no opportunity to grow or evolve with this company. I would highly recommend staying far, FAR away from this company."
bad,"target does not care about you outside of work;  will not work with team member's schedules, etc.  ETLs do not know how to make schedules that are doable."
bad,"Working at Target Cafe was awful. They usually only have one person working at a time, in a area that should have about three people in it at all times. There are a lot of corners cut to get the results that managment wants. I found mold growing under one of the machines and spend an hour and a half removing it. They leave you alone for long periods of time, and with little to no help. I could barely get bathroom breaks or my actual breaks because the people who were supposed to come relieve me refused to. They would just hide and ignore when I'd page for them."
bad,Great Job for teens or college students. The pay is low and the work is tedious.It is ery hard to get a decent raise. Should have organization classes for the managers!
bad,I pushed carts for 8 hours a day for little pay. They tried to have me do things that wasn't in my job description. On the bright side I met some amazing people.
bad,"Absolutely a horrible place to work.  Pay is terrible, management tends to treat employees like utter garbage. Avoid if at all possible."
bad,"Target was a pretty good place to work, not the best though. The salary was good and the other employees were nice. Its a fun place to work especially in the back, I was the only girl for awhile but the guys were really nice and helpful and you can always ask them for help."
bad,"Management was unavailable to me to answer questions and provide needed training."
bad,"Well, where to start....... Target of westminster was one of the worst jobs that i have ever had! Seriously. I'm not even one to hold grudges or remain bitter about things, and  i wont say anything disrespectful, although they did disrespect me to te max!"
bad,"A typical day, hard working,  unappreciated job, they do not care for their employees. The hardest part of the job is giving all you got & not feeling appreciated"
bad,"Leaders acted as high school students by talking about team members and pushing people to quit, rather than firing them since they had no reason to terminate. When team members brought up concerns, no actions were taken by corporate or store management."
bad,"As a former employee, one of my main memories of this place was the lack of care they had for their employees. I found myself in the HR office a few times with complaints towards my boss and how he treated me. When I would call for help, I was ignored. When I was injured, there were no regards to me whenever I needed assistance with heavy lifting. Some coworkers were very rude to the guests who came in, and some of the guests were very foul to me."
bad,"Typical retail store: As a seasonal hire, they put off big airs about the high potential of being hired permanently.  But once the probation period was over, they claimed I didn't put 100% into my work when I busted my tail and bent over backwards to please them."
bad,"You ruined my life, and caused undue mental stress because of your inability to run a company, 14 months of psychiatric treatment after because of you, you're a horrible company"
bad,"Hired on for Targets ""Just in Time"" position, only to end up stocking, facing and cleaning. I feel the company hires on for this position just to get people in the doors to complete their dirty work through the holidays, as it appeared every employee hired on during this season was doing the same. I did leave after the first week of employment since I was not doing what I was hired on to do, even after several discussions with management. Very cold and unfriendly environment. Look elsewhere for a rewarding career. "
bad,"It was my first job and got terminated after two weeks. When asked 'why?'.. the HR lady said, ""You're just not the right fit. You're not who we are looking for."" Those words still depresses me from that day, 3 years ago. I'm glad they got terminated from Canada."
bad,"Overnight Managers want you to clock in 10 minutes early before your shift starts. if you can't clocking before that they write you up. Overnight Managers are very disrespectful. They talk down to you, Call you out your name,  always trying to make you look bad, don't give you the recognition you deserve, they make personally Threats to workers and hold grudges.  The Co-workers and Daytime Managers are very respectful people. But Overnight Managers are a different story."
bad,Management is horrible. The demands they place on cashiers for the little bit of money is horrible and sometimes impossible to complete.
bad,they work you hard and treat you like slaves and then fire you because they bring you in seasonal NOT full time. all of there shifts are long. the ware house period is really dirty. and there Hr department is RUDE.
bad,"Target is a horrible place to work at. the  managers and Hr doesn't care about your personal life or religious beliefs. supervisors play favorites, your work will not be appreciated but scrutinized"
bad,Constantly overlooked for advancement though I regularly trained fresh faced college kids to be my boss only to have them leave the company 6 months later
bad,"The harass employees about their bathroom time."
bad,"Harsh place to work, with uncooperative management and unreal daily goals. Lack of staffing puts strain on everyone, and leaders don't pick up any of the slack, preferring to chat and walk around the store."
bad,No respect for employees . management has no respect for work life balance . very wasteful company . retaliation on employees for not working over time is encouraged . no support from management when a problem occurs . terrible culture .
bad,"Work weekend rotations, last shifts, long working hours, odd working days, work almost every holiday, only days closed are Easter and Christmas."
bad,Managers were very rude. The ETL was always screaming and cursing at myself and the other employers while unloading the truck. This was my first job and would not recommend for anyone who's starting work for the first time.
bad,I hated working for Target.  Work was never organized.  No one cared about how well their work was done.  No one took anything seriously.  All people did was complain.
bad,"The environment is fun and friendly, I enjoy what I do which is basically helping all over the store. The first few months were great, a lot of hours, great pay...now I hate it. Iv come to realize that the way the Target I work for is corrupt, the leaders think they are better then everyone and everyone throws you under the bus. They cut your hours and give all the new employees your hours even though they say they aren't hiring. Would not recommend working here."
bad,Management had a very nasty disposition. Not a friendly environment. Never accommodated employees. I learned how to scan and label inventory. Co-workers worked great as a team. The hardest part was coming to work and not feeling welcome. The most enjoyable part was the learning experience.
bad,"The Management constantly changed your schedule, and or your hours would cut without warning. Many people I worked with received little to no hours for weeks at a time."
bad,All they care about is us getting red cards not about us at all! I do like interacting with most of their customers. They also need to work on how they do their scheduling because most of the time there isn't enough cashiers scheduled but yet they cut our hours even though it is very busy! When I first started there I really thought I was going to retire from there but not anymore. If I loose my job because of this review then so be it I just don't want anyone to go through what I had to go through!
bad,"cashiers were treated like slaves. Most staff is unhappy, unappreciative and miserable. eachday come in and immediately get straight to work non stop with short staff."
bad,"I was there a long time ago, I am not sure how the company is now. I know that i do not support their bathroom regulations and would not ever work there again because of them."
bad,"Fast pace work environment, great customer and employee interaction, decent benefits, sales oriented. Great place to work for someone with a retail mindset"
bad,This Target isn't helpful at all for those with disabilities who can't drive a car & has been trying to find work within walking distance from where she lives so she won't have to waste $$ on taxies! Since I've tried 2 times there for a job within the 33 months since the Dominick's store that next to it closed &have NEVER heard from the store after either time of both job interviews! You guys SUCK at giving local people with disabilities a job!
bad,"Not so much of a fun summer job, but as a sophomore high school student there's no much job opportunities. But you get hours and  overtime paying."
bad,"Working for target at Indio CA as a barista at Starbucks has been one of the worst job I have ever had, management sucks they never help out on anything, and managers are never in their work area usually you'll see managers on their phone or just chit chatting. The team lead at Starbucks doesn't know what she's doing, she never orders the right things their always out of everything she's never at Starbucks and she doesn't even give you brakes or never helps out, everyone is drama there Worst job I've ever had !"
bad,"Horrible supervision. Poor management. Did not learn anything. "
bad,Not really a nice place to work. Everyone slacks off and nothing gets done on time. The management have no respect for the team members.
bad,"Management is very bad. screaming an yelling. belittleing people in front of guests an in front of employees. starts with store manager all the way down to team lead. If I were u I would RUN. don't work here"
bad,Management always wanting you to work in different departments after you do your job god forbid if you ask for help because u never get it they scheledule you till 10:30 am or 11 and get mad if you leave.you cant leave without asking for permission to leave
bad,Target has the worse customer service to date. Everyone in this store had an attitude when you ask for help. The turnover rate was extremely high
bad,"Life has an infinite number of possibilities and your ability to achieve success is limited only by your imagination. However, there are always trade-offs and sometimes moving in one direction prevents you from moving in another."
bad,I worked for target for three years always on top of things always asking if I can help any other way and it always came back to bite me. they don't know how to treat there employees.
bad,Very Unprofessional There They Have Lack Of Team Work The GSTL Are Never Considering At All Its Total Disrespect To The Employees They Never Have Enough Staff For Anything So Now Your Stuck Until They Tell You To Leave
bad,I would start work at 4am and leave the building  at odd time like 5pm or 6pm. the managers are very rude and spiteful. they would ask you to stay well past your scheduled hours and if you said no they would make your next week schedule like 10 hours. The benefits suck the work is hard and the care very little about there employees.
bad,"Horrible company...They came up with Target Brand "
bad,"low wages, long hours, immature staff and crew and loads of drama, do not waste your time in retail. you could advance yourself so much farther."
bad,"typical day with racists people and ignorant kids i learned nothing the management sucked i hated every co worker , nothing was hard about thi job nothing was enjoyable about this job"
bad,Use to be a great company. Now you can barley get 24 hours a week. the raises are poor. less then .25 cents a year. The managers are mostly rude and act like your easily replaced.
bad,The LODS and other management do not care about your physical or mental health. They will work you into the ground and yell at you even if you're doing your best. I got hospitalized from there and they demanded I come back into work the next day.
bad,"Co-workers lazy. When I tell boss, they didn't care. Manager was harsh. Kept piling on work before I could complete my own."
bad,They don't care about your schedule. The management doesn't care if your the only one in your department. They will call you into the team member area and degrade you. They have had a ban on talking to your coworkers and even helping them if they get busy. There is no room for advances unless you are a male. Oh and if your very busy well then good luck getting anyone to help you.
bad,The management was horrible.They treated you like you were less than a person. The pay was low. You could never advance to a management position even after getting a degree because they do not hire from within.
bad,"I worked for Target for approximately one year. During my time there our leadership demonstrated little to no leadership ability, no respect for the Team Members working under them, and an appalling disregard for basic safety procedures as well as food safety procedures."
bad,"Repeatedly over the time I worked at Target I asked for more hours and training and I would be told that they were working on it and then I wouldn't hear anything unless I brought it up again. "
bad,its a very busy business a lot of customers some rude some nice over all a family place 30 min lunch brakes friendly staff dress code black tan red shirt
bad,As long as target supports the sick people  I urge every to boycott hem in everyway don't even work form them hurt them where it matters until they stand down USE THE REST ROOM THAT IS  FOR THE WAY YOU WERE BORN
bad,"Warehouse worker didn't stay long heard nothing but bad things about the place went and found out everything every one said was true they work you to death, You can get the same pay in town you only get two 23 min breaks in a ten hour shift crazy. If you somke  you are spending  ten minutes walking  believe. Me not worthwhile.  Dont waste your time!"
bad,"Extremely understaffed, no advancement unless you were a favorite, no matter how much knowledge you acquired.  Ridiculous expectations for minimum wage."
bad,"Training is ""OK"""
bad,"It was incredibly unpleasant to work at Target. The LOD's are stuck up, and they seem to be only interested in their own jobs, and not the store they are at. You can't move up in the company without a degree, and if you started as a regular employee you can't move up."
bad,"Horrible management. Employees were very rude to customers and did not respect employees. I would never work for this company again, Pay and breaks were unfair when given."
bad,I only worked here for a month. The reason I didn't stay very long was because every time I clocked in it seemed like no one knew what they were supposed to be doing. The managers often pushed their own tasks onto other associates. People are always leaving and new people are always getting hired. It just wasn't a very good job in general.
bad,"I have left Target Stores over eight years ago I do not have an opinion to share. Sorry I have moved on. Management set their requirements and I complied, coworkers were okay to work with."
bad,Was a manager for softlines obviously target is gone from canada now so i really dont need to say much in this regards its sad that it was poorly managed
bad,"This job provided a great starting point in my employment. The wages could have been a lot better, as well as the benefits more affordable."
bad,Constant turnover of management made it impossible to have any consistency.Let go for doing things previous managers told me to do.No support
bad,"Pay and benefits are a joke. Upper managers do nothing but complain about the work you do. Never appreciate the work you do. You have to be in  ""their"" pack to get approval and appreciated for work done. Pushing red card applications and not getting noticed for them."
bad,i sincerely hated working here. management sucked. pay and hours were the only upside to working at this place. overall: horrible place to work.
bad,only get about 12 hours every 2 weeks. no one speaks English and its hard to train a person that doesn't understand you. even the management
bad,Very first job worked here for about three months before finding a new job. Terrible place to work at and it eventually got shut down lol
bad,"Target is a horrible work center. From my experience at Target I have learned that Target is a very uncaring workplace and has no compassion for its workers. A typical day at work is very difficult to get through, and upsetting. The bosses are very mean to the workers, and this job does not seem to understand that life does happen."
bad,The management is very young and easily distracted. Very slow paced. Little to no benefits.Short lunches and uninterested co-workers.
bad,"You are required to work some nights and weekends regardless of other activities including church or school. Management positions work endless hours, and there is no work/life balance. They talk a huge game when they hire you, but nothing is seen through. The communication is terrible and HR in store is never willing to help. The Human Resources for the district is even worse. Also, the employee discount is only 10%."
bad,The money is great but the work is very hard and draining. The employees are not treated fairly and there is a lot of favoritism. For the months that I was there all I can say is that the money was great but not a great place to work.
bad,Not recommend for anyone to work at this job that's why their always hiring. if you need money then of course apply but no this job was stressfull . the managers acts like you don't have a life like this job suppose to be your only focus.
bad,Similar to any other retail job. Asks you to do the same as any other job would. Certain team members worked harder than others. Good store vibe. Polite customer service and friendly cashiers.
bad,Working here is liking being back in high school. People start rumors all the time and like to start trouble with anyone and everyone.
bad,Do not recommend anyone to work their especially minorities. They only hire you then lie to you about your work just to get another group in for that low pay rate. Besides most jobs out there are set up and meant for you to fail.
bad,"Target is a wonderful place for customers but cares very little about it's employees and their needs. Employees are treated as though they are a dime a dozen and as soon as they come or go they are replaced the very same second. The pay is almost laughable as well as the benefits, though people often cannot afford to just leave or end their time at the job so they are stuck and miserable which comes across to the customers who shop with them."
bad,"I worked at Target for a total of 9 months. Target puts up a nice, trendy front, but they overwork their employees for minimal pay. I worked at Walmart for 3 years, and other retailers, so the difference is night and day with how badly Target treats its employees compared to other retailers."
bad,horrible expiernce did not lie it at all it was very bad i didnt get along eith anyone wanted to leave the whole time fjoawiejr ooijdfawl kejfoiawjeoijaownn qwfawtt wt toijfsn wf wjwlkm
bad,Think people can live on 8.00 dollars an hr. that's impossible.Only want you to get credit applications to get customer in more debt that they can not afford.Most of the guest get upset with you for asking them.
bad,"My experience at Target was awful. The management was extremely awful, they were, what literally felt like, ""Whip-Crackers."" They did NOT care for their employees in the slightest. We were treated like Mules, and constantly disrespected by management and coworkers. I was often overworked, sometimes working 60-80 hours a week, with only one day off. I had to skip meals most days, mostly because I didn't have time to eat, sleep, or maintain basic hygiene in my day to day life. The schedule was completely unstable, the time we were asked to come in for work would change almost everyday. Some days, it was 12:00 AM, some days it was 1:00 AM, or 2:00 AM, or 3:00 AM, or 4:00 AM. They often used this to their advantage, by giving us very little time between shifts. This job was easily the worst job experience I ever had, as on my last day, my leg and back both gave out after being told to lift something, that I could not carry. The Coworkers were also extremely rude, but I can personally not blame them for that."
bad,Not the best work environment. Management is always out to fire someone. They are constantly looking to cut people down. They treat you like your not important.
bad,Just a typical day at work where guest always yelling at you about prices and its always busy. You dont have a moment to yourself. Its not the best job but its a job
bad,"I did not like working for target located on jefferson davis hwy, alexandria va. Poor management and favoritism was displayed a lot on the job. I only applied for the job and took the offer because I was desperate for work, after being unemployed for four months (2015)."
bad,"not enough hours, you must cross train in order to get more hours. full time becomes part time in slow times. you are forced to travel and help out another targets without being asked first plus not paid millage"
bad,I was an employee and was talked down on for taking a break after all the other employees had gone on break and I was okay with that
bad,"Too many chiefs, not enough indians"
bad,They over work everyone. They don't pay the employees enough. Never would I work for them. Unless they pay more and give benefits
bad,"Target hires people at minimum wage and gives pennies and dimes as a raise once every year. If you work hard you are not rewarded for it, you are simply worked harder and given more responsibility without more pay."
bad,You cant get promoted I was harassed by the store manager there laughed at and made fun of. He said cruel things to me and yelled at me all the time. I could get no help from any of the hire ups. This is the worst place ever.
bad,"Typical day at Target as a Cart Attendant consists of you being the jack of all trades to the store.  Job is to obviously keep the carts stocked in the building but thats not the entire job description.  Cashiers need help because their slow...time to hop o register.  Theres a spill in aisle 9....need you to go clean it.  Floor team needs help stocking......we need you to go do that.  Service desk is swamped....ya we need you to aide them too.  Oh by the way, why are your carts low?  Sorry, let me split into five different people.  You go outside to get what carts that are outside, turns out theres hardly much since its so busy in the store.  Managers hassle you about no carts in the building....apparently I should have the ability to make more carts that dont actually exist."
bad,Management were unprofessional. Could not keep many people employed for more than 2 months. Constant hiring of new people who were either scared into quitting or fired.
bad,"target is basically a job that uses you and kicks you out after"
bad,"Provided outstanding Customer Service.Cash handling, bagged items carefully, checked ID for alcohol and tobacco purchases, kept my work area clean and organized."
bad,"My direct supervisor was one of those ignorant people who hated my guts the minute she met me, for no reason. I was screamed at across the store, humiliated in front of guests. Nothing was done to help me by human resources to make situation better. They didn't care. How disappointing. I expected more from a large retailer. The pay is a joke, nobody can live on those wages. Long dull hours, often skipped over for my break. Just abuse, abuse, abuse."
bad,"promotions were based on who you knew, not who could do the job best. those with actual retail experience were pushed out by insecure management that came from backgrounds with no retail experience.  "
bad,Terrible place to work. They like to cut your hours. They are always under staffed so you are always over worked. The managers don't know how to do their jobs and they treat the employees poorly.
bad,"this job was a volunteer position i had to do in high school, so there for it was not a paying job. i was instructed to do maintenance and cleaning throughout the community center."
bad,"Horrible place to work target just needs to close and not do business with anyone they are horrible to there employees, long weird hours and minimum wage but require you to do more then is in your job or do other peoples job, and if you take a day off the punish you."
bad,"I didn't like working here at all. The managers pawn all the work on the underlings and never help to lift the burden, the hours were either feast of famine, the pay was minimum wage and the benefits were nearly non-existent."
bad,target was ok i just didnt like retail very low wage very stressful job people are rude and hours sucked big time high school job anything else is a loss.
bad,"I was hired for target in 2011. It was a seasonal job. So after the time they let me go. Which I was ok with that. From there I went to work at Wal-Mart. I gathered so much experience in retail. Such as inventory, merchandise flow, and a deli associate . Target has been adding job opportunities on those categories . That I have more then 2 years experience in. And they won't even give me a chance. If you worked for target before and try to reapply they aren't gonna hire you. They put some kind of thing in your profile. Like a red tag. Once your working there it's good. I loved working there way better then Wal-Mart. It's more of a professional feelings then Wal-Mart is. But once they look you go. It's over for you in that company. Even if you were a seasonal worker. I loved it there. But like I said. Them doing that. Makes them less of a people company then Wal-Mart. The only positive then about Wal-Mart is that they give opportunities for the people."
bad,"W never got the 15 minute breaks that we were entitled to by law.  Never enough employees to meet the needs of guests in a timely manner. Serious favortism.  They would threaten to write you up for every little thing.  No one every wanted to come for back up so there would be a long line of irate customers that wanted to purchase cartloads of groceries.  Unrealistic expectations.  They expect things to be done at a certain time, only you couldn't get it done in time because you also had to ring up customers, answer the phone and fill all at once."
bad,"Management is childish and talk's badly about other members of the staff, also about guest. They play all day and eat, then when corporate comes in to town they run around acting like they are working. They don't know the jobs they are hired for and think over working and under paying their employee's is ok. Not allowed over time will actually tell you to find ways to cut out over time so they can get their raises each quarter."
bad,"After working your shift on your feet for hours, you are required to stay after to clean other areas that you were not responsible for because other people decided not to do their job."
bad,"Target has people come and go and they have issues with people stealing internally and extrernally, They treat there employees like cattle move them in and move them out and dont pay them for there hard dedication or time."
bad,Poor training program and misleading application process for store manager position.  Most leaders are given little to no autonomy to manage departments using previous experience.
bad,not to bad but not too good either. i worked there for a few years. ive thought about going back...maybe someday. but it is a good place to work for a first job
bad,Worked for Target for many years with very little merit increase. I felt more like a poorly behaved child than an employee. Management was not very understanding with life happenings and favoritism is very evident.
bad,They do not provide a serviceable pay to their employees. Do not care about their workers they really just seem to care about what they can get out of you before you burn out.
bad,"When I started working at Target I fully believed it was going to be a temporary thing until I got my feet back on the ground again. I was led to believe that if you worked hard, learned your job well and always tried to improve and do the best you could that you would be able to move up if you wanted to."
bad,When I first started target was a very fun and friendly place to work but as the years went on the worse it got. Mangement is not good only care about sales and looks of the store. Low pay
bad,I hated being a sales assistant for this company.  THey were awful the store was poorly run and managed. it should be c;losed down because they are so horrible. straight facts
bad,"Great job, long shifts, plenty of work to do. The staff was awesome. We had a lot of fun togther just wish the company had better benefits."
bad,"Great company to work for, but very un-forgiving if things un-expectantly arise (i.e, family emergency, car broke down while driving to work, ect.). They expect you to bust your tail and do way more than your job assignment is, of which is normal.  But on the flip side, they are very flexible at the beginning, but towards the end...its like they don't even care that you work there and have an outside life as well outside of Target."
bad,I loved this Job because of the many things I got to experience while working there and I would love to go Back to the Target someday and I would want to be back in Stewarding because I just loved it there
bad,"If you are actually a hard worker don't expect to ever move up in this company. If you can hide your bad attitude behind a smile pretty well while barely working you will go far though! They keep the hard workers where they are, actually doing the work, and literally make it impossible for them to advance."
bad,"was great in the beginning, then  they hired people who had just graduated and trying to prove themselves. Co workers were great , built many friendships while working there. It was hard working nights,missed lots of family activities."
bad,"You were never doing what you were hired to do. I learned not to expect anything from management. "
bad,fast fun friendly check out is not the greatest check out. the coworkers are not that friendly. the store is very unorganized
bad,The hours sucks you would be lucky if you make 25hrs a week. They dont care if you have bills or a family to take care of. No one makes overtime. All the management sticks together so their open door policy is all lies.
bad,"Working hard and meeting my goal that are required by management for the day. Ensuring the task is completed before I leave for the day. "
bad,Management does not promote from within. Even after you have demonstrated time and time again how much knowledge you posses they still do not promote internally.
bad,"Target takes their displays ( TV's, bikes, furniture etc.) And throws them in a baler (compactor) when the new displays come in. Appalling , horrible pay, treats employees like peasants, completely brain washes the weak,  management is so  artificial, forced to ""sell"" red cards like slaves. Horrific hours and stuck up customers, and easy to be demoted. Need I go on......!"
bad,"Target was my first actual job. I loved working there in the beginning, everything was absolutely great. A typical day is fast paced which i love. I would sometimes be scheduled under the fitting room, sales floor, guest service, or Starbucks. I loved the opportunities to cross train in different areas. Then as time progressed I noticed that the management would relocate and change very fast. Nothing was consistent. Co-workers were great while they lasted. The hardest part and most important part of the job would be dealing with unsatisfied customers. Sometimes they can really upset you but you have to just keep your friendly face on and compromise with them.   The most upsetting part of the on would be that if Target didn't meet sales they would be able to pay their employees so they would have to cut hours. And even though I was trained in four different areas of the store I would only be getting maybe 3-4 days a week if that. The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping a guest and seeing the complete enjoyment or satisfaction on their face when they get something they like. Retail was a great first job but I need something more in the path of career that I want."
bad,"Os dias eram bastante difíceis, as duvidas que eram levadas aos superiores normalmente eram tratadas como bobas, e raramente eram solvidas. A direção muitas vezes fecha os olhos para a gerencia, que na maioria das vezes não sabia o que acontecia  no seu setor."
bad,"Co-workers extremely hostile, management allowed me to be harassed, customers regularly called me explicit names and threatened me. My hours were MUCH less than promised even though they continued to hire more people. You are expected to do a ridiculous amount of work very quickly for minimum wage. Training is a joke. I guess the high turnover rate was a red flag but I was foolishly optimistic. I still feel anxiety when I drive by the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was quitting."
bad,"target is a read flag job, don't know who runs the night shift but your in for a lot of work. its slow, unorganized, and the employees are immature."
bad,I honestly can't say much because I hope the company has grown since I left because they were just opening when I started working there. Management I will say has people who use there position for the personal benefit which is not smart for business
bad,"Its the worst job to do at target. the team leads dont listen to reason, the coworkers were annoying, and you wake up at 3 to be to work at 4."
bad,"Working at target is similar to most retail fields. The employees are underpaid, the only people making money is management. But, the people are nice, the management is actually great and helpful. But its hard to survive in a big city making 8.50 a hr while only working 12 hrs a week smh. This job is only is only for students or someone who needs a small paying job on the side. If you are looking to make a living, keep looking."
bad,Short on staff. No form of organization. Out of date PDA system. No form of recognition or scheduling. The worst thing of all is the fact every employee wants to work somewhere else.
bad,Target sucks and the people are messy like going back to high school need a new work place with benefits an less messiness
bad,Very stressful and on your feet all day long with no breaks. Working with a lot of high school and college team members who do not have any work ethic.
bad,A typical day at work involved unpacking shipment in a timely manner. We had a diverse group of co-workers. Hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting. Most enjoyable part of the job was working in a fun team.
bad,"a typical day at work is stressful and unorganized. Management is the worst they expect so much yet do so little.  "
bad,I loved this job i loved the people i worked with i loved the room for advancement there was not enough hours to make money hours were constantly dropped but overall it was a okay job the customers made the job
bad,Do not work here. It is bad. I don't like it. it was awful. Horrible managers. No room for improvement. Very needy. Do not ever think about working here .
bad,"Target is a horrible employer, I wouldn't trust them ever again. I don't have any good words about Target, they a 3rd rate retailer."
bad,Working at Target is no better than working at Walmart. I worked in the back room and was constantly given tasks that the supervisor should be doing without the pay. There was little accountability when it came to other departments not completing their tasks or making it harder on the department that I worked in. I do not mind working but I like to be paid accordingly which Target never did.
bad,They were prejudice.Only gave hours to people of there kind.They were rude and mean and not helpful at all.I would not recommend any 1 to work there.
bad,"They are vague in explaining what your role or position is supposed to be and management slacks-off all the time.I thought I was hired to do HR and that was not the case. I was poorly trained by a supervisor who took a vacation after a week of me being there. The employees are odd and unfriendly, its a terrible company to work for hands-down."
bad,"Horrible management, customers are extremely rude considering Target treats them like ""guests"" and not customers. Low pay, always asking you to do extra things out side of your job description (but you know that being ""asked"" by management really is a demand, not a question). The employees that I worked with were great, but in reality it's a dirty, poorly run store. Management is constantly hovering over your shoulder to make sure that you sell those Red Cards. If you don't sell 2 Red Cards each shift, they take notice and cut your hours. Do not work here. Not worth it."
bad,"great employees to work with, they are very friendly and helpful. Great at communicating and really good with the customers."
bad,"I would clock in and stock, then they would have me to ring out customers at the register, they had me to stay overnight and work and what i didn't like is people constantly complaining . But its a retail business that just wasn't for me."
bad,Usually when scheduled they only give you say four hours then  ask you to stay later then when you say you can't they get very rude with you. My coworkers are amazing they're very friendly and absolutely amazing.
bad,"	Hired new staff "
bad,Not an organized company known to lay people off. Very bad company to work for do not recommend working therenot a good company.
bad,Almost no hours were given and then when you were scheduled to work it would be outside of your availability. I don't know if all target locations are like that but store 1012 in Niagara Falls ny is.
bad,Working at target is work. My co-workers are cool and my guest makes my day everyday. I learned how to use a wave working at target.
bad,"I applied for cashier, but I was forced to work in the food department. I was very displeased when they made the switch, i was hurt that they didn't inform me. I liked the idea that cash was barely used at all."
bad,Communication from management is very bad and fake. Advancement is almost not possible. Always cutting hours. Typical day was very stressful and you never knew when you were going to be coached. The harder you work the worst they were on you.
bad,Got hurt on the job after doing every single thing they asked me to do and they let me go. I really loved helping the guest coworkers are great but corporate could careless about their workers.
bad,Unloaded and loaded trucks. Used RF scanner to locate items and put into stock. Also kept up the inventory levels. There was a great deal of satisfaction when we got a raise.
bad,"Disgusting environment. I never seen anything like it. Everyone was mean or super stressed out, the patients rushed and were spoiled, the pharmacists yelled to you to do things everyone didnt want to help i would never want to work there. and the main Personnel person was HORRIBLE, SPOILED, TOO PRIVILEGED and refused to help and was mean and just horrible. If you paid me a million dollars i would still say NO!  I would recommend even if you are desperate, choosing starvation beats being beat up on by staff, management and customers.  Don't waste your time.. Also fav. and other things I wont say."
bad,"I worked there for 8 years and i wasnt happy."
bad,"I wouldn't work in a Target store again.  Their overall employees, do not stay on a average a short  time. Whether its and employee or management,(head manager) they stay their less than a year.  I found the stealing that goes on is a lot."
bad,"I liked working at Target but, there were too many workers. No one knew who others were and the place was rarely organized. Breaks were short and people were rude."
bad,"Money focused environment. Newly remodeled office and very clean. The management team treats employees like animals. Great location, near freeways. Large variety of nearby food places."
bad,Was told I did not get a break for a four hour shift. Was told I do not get a second break when working an eight hour shift. No one at my store has ever been promoted from TM to TL. Team Leads are required to be on call and stay in the building on their lunch even though they are hourly.
bad,"	Greeted and engaged customers"
bad,Target wasn't anything special. There were no bonds that you had with people. You were on your own. It wasn't very team friendly. Also it was run how the management wanted to run it. There was no say in your opinion
bad,"Working at the Target in Independence I was young and didn't really mind the pay. It was kind of little high at the time for how much work you had to do so that part doesn't need a real review. The management on the other hand, needed a lot of work."
bad,"They use you up and then look for any reason to fire you. What ever you do,don't let a loved one become ill . When you come back from FMLA they will terminate you and have all the paperwork in order . Very devilish company and they will be judged one day for thier actions."
bad,"during my stundentship and internship got the chance to use my clinical knowledge and interpersonal skills to provide patient care in partnership with patients and other healthcare professionals,"
bad,"Fast paced environment"
bad,"Overworked and heavy stress level a very difficult job"
bad,what a horrible company to work for! they were not compassionate when I was in a bad car accident. I was on light duty from the doctor ( had a note and everything) they ignored it and made me work the hardest heaviest isle. ( laundry detergent) also when i got a temporary part time job. I told them it was temporary! they said they could work around it. But when i went to leave for it one day I was told i had to commit and pick which job i wanted more. horrible staff!
bad,horrible no support no respect they suck period few hours 10 min  break time dont honor family emergencys  over work you attitude problems not enough pay etc
bad,"There was really no room to grow. A lot of favouritism. although in the beginning they appeared to be very supportive, and have a great team culture, i think the pressure of trying to succeed in Canada got the best of them"
bad,Was not really to impress seem like management were always gone like out an coworkers always wanted take v leave off so it was bad on us sesonal people
bad,"Responsibilities include delivering products to store accounts in a timely fashion, collect money for store deliveries, lifting up to 150 lbs on a consistent basis, restocking the merchandise and building visual displays within the store, working hands on with store managers and sales representatives to keep merchandise stocked"
bad,the boss laid everyone off and ran off with everyones money. I wished I never worked for him. barry dent
bad,it was an ok job not to fine of it but if i had to i would do it again
bad,"Not alot to do if you were a male, it was hard for kids to smile and behave for let alone listen. If you were a female the kids listen and did whatever was told of them. I was told told females have that warmth and warm greeting that kids liked and males have the strong protective that kids stay away from."
bad,"The work environment was good but there was co-workers that don't like teaching you stuff. I learned how to deal with customers because its not that easy to deal with. The hardest part of my job was when customers scream at you,and you cant even scream back at them. The most enjoyable stuff was when my day was going good with customers. Or helping customers."
bad,expect more pay less applies to how they treat the employees cutitng hours and pay while expecting us to do more work than possible in less time.
bad,"A complete waste of time and no real chance for growth! You stand at the cash register all day, you get yelled at for having water and get attitudes for using the bathroom."
bad,"The raises are unfair for the amount of worked they expect."
bad,Its a part time job with no benefits.  You will be treated like cattle at all times.  The only thing they want is for the shelves to look good at all times.  You won't learn anything.  Don't bother.
bad,"Though I did receive a basic training for future jobs at Target Canada, it is not the most desirable place to be. I gave each aspect 1 star because it was mandatory to do so, there is no opportunity for advancement inside the store, they almost always hire from outside of the store. Almost everyone in management have never been a team member before, so they have no idea the amount of work they give you, they give you an unreasonable amount of work in an unreasonable amount of time and their tactic in dealing with the matter is flawed. Co-workers are usually grumpy and moody because they've been worked too hard too long for not enough money, and pulled in every other direction a million times. But sometimes they have cake in the break room so."
bad,its is ok don't recommend to any one. work and work with no play
bad,coworkers and guests can be very friendly but management is horrible.
bad,I feel that this company requires unrealistic expectations for their employees.
bad,this was by far the worst job I had the hours suck and it very depressing no room for growth and they return policy on their items are horrible and nasty people wold try on clothes and not buy it and it stinks but you have to put it back so someone else can buy it yuck.
bad,I currently work at target every thing they say is not true they tell u what u want to here in the interviews to get u in the door and then fill the entire scrip once u get there I was hired as a shift manager two years ago they have gave me every excuse in the book why the are putting it off they give u 4.75 hours a week and want you to call in to see if they need people that's how u get your hours and promotions are a joke the hire new people every month so you are competing. With people who have already been there and new employees. Just to get 30 hours and your discount is a.joke to.
bad,There were some really nice people I worked with that deserve a lot better. Nothing more.
bad,target is not a good place to work the management and associates that have been there a long time are disrespectful and don't take well to new comer that are starting

bad,"This job was very fast paced, you always had to be accurate and team-oriented"
bad,"Was lied to about my job title from the start. Reneged on it more than once. Unhappy coworkers and managers.Was going to still work there part time but when I got an IT job, I was terminated."
bad,I learned how to improve my customer service skills. The management was not consistent and unprofessional.
bad,I didn't like working there. There was really no room to grow. The people were great.
bad,"Target  is the worst organization I have ever worked for. The reason being is the management team- the general manager, the assistant manager and all the other wannabe assistants with bloated titles. And red cards. "
bad,"Management was terrible, one manager asked me to go against store policies and rules to clean up bodily fluids, and was almost fired upon refusal."
bad,Assisting guest in the store is the most pleasurable aspect of the job.
bad,"Nice co-workers."
bad,"It was alright, i was there for both the morning cashier shift and the overnight re -model crew. Everything you would expect from a retail job was here: angry customers, a few bad spill cleanups, grumpy or over happy managers."
bad,Not a good place to work. They were not very accommodating about giving you extra hours to work when you asked.
bad,"All I did here was cash people out,  I was actually paid to walk around and start conversations with customers.  I  am a people person and I love to talk to others so that was a big plus."
bad,horrible company.  horrible guests.  worst job ever.  horrible pay.
bad,"Target is such a terrible place to work for, Unless you are salaried they don't care because you are easily disposable. Unless you drink their kool aid so to speak you will be progressed out or your hours will be cut"
bad,This was an absolutely terrible place to work. Terrible organization and it is very corrupt. I would never recommend anyone with a college degree work here.

bad,You are not treated like a human being. They think you owe your life to the job when for most people it is only a income till they can find what they want to do in life.

bad,As a cashier you constantly stand on your feet with little room for breaks.
bad,"No opportunity.  Older workers, beware.  Poor pay and expect the world.  Poor hours."
bad,"Absolutely worst retail job I have ever worked. Major favoritism goes on between co-workers. I put on my application that I could only work 8am-6pm because I have a daughter and that's the time she was in daycare and they still put me on 3 different 4-10pm nights a week even after I reminded them multiple times I couldn't do that. I would have 2 days off a week and the whole time I worked there they would call me every day off I had asking me to come in. The pay is bad. They put on my paper work I would get $9.50/hr but when I got my first pay stub it said $8/hr. They all refused to change it. And you can only use your bs 10% discount if you pay will cash or use the red card, if you use your bank card you won't be allowed to use your discount. Be careful if you work for target"

bad,Le gerant de magasin n'y connait rien. et manque totalement d'experience pour ce poste. Il se vente meme d'avoir aucun empathie pour les employers et ne veux rien savoir des idee des autres.
bad,Many of the supervisors don't listen to their employees and don't really do anything to try to make the job easier for the employees.
bad,"Management has been on a downhill course ever since I got there. Thought it couldn't get any worse and they proved me wrong. They view you as ""replaceable"" (senior manager's words, not mine) worker bees that they do not care about and they treat you as such. There is an atmosphere of utter disrespect and disdain for anyone that is not a senior manger, they openly talk trash and belittle the lower level managers out in the open. So imagine how they treat regular employees... I have witnessed high-schoolers and college kids get belittled and threatened to tears and seriously worry about psychological scarring."
bad,Over 4 years working am not happy with the changes in the company and they do not offer promotion often
bad,"I hated working here, I never felt like a valued employee, they made me feel like I was lucky to have a job with them at all. While with the company I was repeatedly watched over while I was busy with customers, talked down to like a child in daycare, and there was no opportunity for advancement for me. Management at the old store I worked for in Morrisville, NC made it seem that to cross-train me was a priviledge instead of an investment within the company through me. Meanwhile, I witnessed many new people being hired and cross-trained automatically. I feel like I was discriminated against, and then when I put in my transfer request because I moved, they trashed my record making me look like an unfit employee which led the Target location store where I moved automatically terminate my application. I would never work for this company again nor let anyone I cared for work for this company. After 7 1/2 long, miserable months of me making the company money, they only gave me a $0.10 raise, tried to fire me, refused to cross-train me, and then trashed my review for a transfer. Target overall: great place to shop, horrible place to work; I wish the best of luck to the next set of employees who willfully enlist."
bad,I worked for Target in the 90's and again now.  It was way better then.  Now it is all about the red cards and lots of chauvinist/sexist/ageists attitudes.  Thanks but no thanks.
bad,"The Target distribution center runs itself like the old days of chariots and slaves.  Masters who rule without checks and balance.  did well there for a while, the ""rulers"" were more paper educated, but my years of experience made my leave comfortable.  my resume can not reflect for they are no longer there."
bad,"I've worked at two different Targets in the past four years as a cashier. I've been asking for quite some time to be trained in other places of the store, but for some reason or another they continually avoid scheduling me anywhere but the front end, because I do guest services as well. Just know if you're looking into this job that the higher ups in the store (ETLs, HR, etc.) think very highly of themselves for no reason and everyone looks down on the cashiers. I don't understand why, but this is just the environment of both Targets that I have worked at. "
bad,the hiring process at Target sucks. Other companies are better at hiring new employess. Target doesn't want to hire people with experience. They want to hire people with no experience so they can pay them less money. They rather hire someone who have no experience so they can pay them minimum wage instead of hiring someone with alot of experience for a higher wage.
bad,"No sense of direction"
bad,"Management is terrible, apparently hires those with no experience at all. Provides no help to problems, basically a sink or swim company. Also, management is lazy, treats employees unfairly, favoritism plays a huge role there, and no knowledge of policies in certain areas of the store."
bad,"I worked at the Super Target in Northlake, my experience there was not a good one. Management there is pretty terrible, as far as working with employees with scheduling, they schedule them under whats best for Target and not both the employee and Target. Also the work environment is not friendly, a lot of employees complain about their job while working."
bad,This is not a good place to work. Employees are disrespected on a regular basis. I am unhappy there and currently looking for another job.
bad,Hard to have a family or life working at this place. From co-workers stealing and jerk managers it was the worst place to work. I would say stay in school and look for something better.
bad,Long hours at the register on your feet and will possibly have back problems.
bad,A typical day of work only consisted of 4-6 hours. Limited room for advancement. I learned to train new employees as well as how to interview potential employees.
bad,"Help unload the truck for the first 2 hours, then go back to my specific team and start setting shelves for new products.  I can now read a plan-o-gram, and follow thru with it, measure the spaces inbetween shelves and make adjustments as needed.  Co-workers are friendly and hard working.  The hardest part of the job, was being giving 2 days worth of work and only having one day to do it in.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers."
bad,You are not an individual in this company. You are a body and a computer projects the amount of bodies needed to complete a process and this is how you are treated. You will be favored if you condone the brown nosing it  entails. Prepare to be thought of as an idiot. Additionally  yearly reviews are insulting.
bad,the working experience at target was horrible and i would never work there or another retail store ever again.
bad,Working here as the operator was the greatest experience ever because it was something new and I could put other skills I had to work.
bad,When I accepted a position with Target the company and management claimed that they cared about their employees and work/life balance. In the end they cared only about their bottom line. The management is incompetent and constantly fighting amongst themselves make the workplace a very unfriendly place to be with bad energy daily.
bad,This is probably the worst job I have ever worked at. The management is terrible and the hours suck. And they dont care about their employees at all.
bad,"A typical day at work is showing up and completing all tasks to the best of my ability for the growth and prosperity of the company.  I have learned that target is a Team-oriented Environment,Increasingly frustrating place to work . The hardest part of working at target is working nights .Is showing up with a smile and geting the work done ."
bad,Rather not talk about this job. Met some great people and gained some knowledge and experience.

bad,"Typical day consisted of unloading boxes, and stocking shelves."
bad,"Worse place I have ever worked at. No chance for advancement, encouraged to work in unsafe manners, borderline hostile work environment. Management knows nothing about our job duties let alone theres. HR brushes off reports and concerns like it isn't their problem and turns it around on you."
bad,"I prepared food. People were cool up until I left. I don't have anything else to say, I don't have time for this."
bad,"never work here, collect welfare instead, you will make more"
bad,was just an summer job. great experience but didnt really get anything out of it.
bad,bad overall experience that was ended by a fiasco where an upper management member decided to make my team martyrs.
bad,The website is making me review Target twice. I don't like the way Target treated it's employees.
bad,This company does not care about you as a person. Management is horrible and they are not consistent in positions.
bad,such a terrible place. managers are ignorant pompous jerks who have no respect for their employees who work harder than they do in fact having to do extra work to make up for the lack of work the managers do themselves. this company's treatment of its employees is truly horendous.
bad,"Scanning products for customers. learned how to use a cash register. management was awesome. had a great team. Hardest part of the job was locating a product. satisfying a customer was the most enjoyable,"
bad,"typical day at work is unloading trucks and staocking and arranging displays. I learn how to fold soft lines and how t display them correctly. The management is horrible. Never really took care of problems that really needed to be fixed. They should of hired more professional co workers. Hardest part of the job was getting a 2,000 piece truck unloaded and put away withiing 5 hours. Most enjoyable part was the 10% discount on anything in the store"
bad,They treat the employees like they are not needed. This company is run by Market Source not Target and should not be taken as a reflection of Target as a whole.
bad,I have worked for Target at 2 locations and I would not recommend working at either of them. Management/team leads for both locations are very poor and they do not give their employees due respect.
bad,"i really didn't learn anything at target, management was okay i can say there was no hardest thing about this job just the fact you have lot of go backs to do its not an enjoyable job i can tell you that"
bad,"I hated working for Target. The pay was horrible, scheduling was horrible, and no one knew what they were doing."
bad,I worked overnight. Management wasn't organized. They were young and always playing. They should take better care of their stores and find better managers.
bad,"Do not bother applying to join target. They promise their ""team members"" atleast 30 hours a week. I was working between 35-40 hours a week there between store set up and december. Now I have one 4 hour shift a week. After talking to my store manager, he pretty much told me ""that's life"". You can really see the favouritism as another cashier has 20 hours a week, when some of us have 4. The team leaders brush you off their shoulders and the management could care less about what you have to say. The only thing I like about working there was the friends I made. Other then that I dread going there now and am currently seeking other employment...."

bad,"Did not give recognition to hard working employees, lie to employees, ridiculous work schedules.and do not pay the employees what they are worth. Company went out of business"
bad,"If you're thinking about working at Target think again. Seems like a great company at first glance but when you get there its a different story. They list the job as full time but then when they offer you the job, they say there is not full time and your hours will change based on sales. Thats a bunch of BS because even when they exceed their target sales your hours still suck. Some weeks you get 35 hrs and they next week 11. And If you make mistakes they don't tell you and treat you like garbage. They just write reports about you and then have meetings out of nowhere with a list of complaints about you.WORSE JOB EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!"
bad,My job here started out okay.I was somethings going on in the stores that i did not agree with it was a lot of favoritism within management.
bad,"I hate target and their sales Tatics for trying to persuade ""guests"" into getting a Red Card. My first day I worked with another team member doing Sales Floor, she was pretty cool, as most as the other team members were, however for my cashier training, I read a book for 20 minutes, watched someone cashier for 10 minutes then I was forced into cashiering on my own for a 6 hour shift. That was pretty much my whole training. Horrible! When I did have questions about stuff that I was not trained on or shown how to do, some of the workers would roll their eyes, or get upset in front of guests! I hate not being trained properly because someone else doesnt give one ****. One day, I came in for my scheduled shift to see which area I'd be working in and I was scheduled to do Calfs (sp). Which I had no idea what they were or what I should be doing in between time as they were getting loaded and ready to be pushed. They just assign you stuff without even training you, then get upset when you have questions. I dont get it? We were forced to sell Redcards to our guests. They even have an hour were we HAVE to walk up to every customer in the store, ask if they need help finding anything and introduce them to savings by either a Redcard or using the Cartwheel app. Being FORCED to do stuff like this took the fun out of everything. I stayed there for 2 and a half months. The other employees (mostly) girls like to talk about the new hires. How they are so slow, or stupid. I heard it everyday while I was there. Someone was always taliking about someone new. We were all new hires at once, give"
bad,"I would Open or close the store with no other management in the building.  I would train all front end employees.  I would coach team members and train them on the correct way to do things. I would write 90 day reviews, annual reviews and termination paperwork.  I was responsible for the store running smoothly on a daily basis with customers and team members."
bad,the most enjoyable thing about working at target was the volunteer work that we did in schools. We would remodel their libraries and other areas that would need remodeling in their school. I would always set sales planners to advertise what we had on sale for the week or the month. The managers we ok at times they did work and help & other times associates barely get help. I don't think it was any hard part about my job except inventory. My co workers were always helpful most of my co workers are very good friends of mine and we all got along most of the time.
bad,Don't work here. Management only cares about themselves and what makes them look good.
bad,I stocked shelves and assisted in customer service. I learned to set up displays in the store. The managers were fair and helpful and so were the co-workers. The hardest part was standing for long hours. The best part was helping our customers.
bad,This was the worst place to work the management was horrible. I learned that no matter what you asked them they looked at you like you were beneath them.
bad,Target is not a job you could count on for good job security. It is a lot of heavy lifting.  I have learned many different work areas.  Management is the worst I have ever worked for.  Co-workers stick together and help each other when needed.  Hardest part of the job is pulling heavy pallets from one end of the store to the other.  The most enjoyable part of my job is completing the truck and coming clean for the following work day.
bad,The company is a great company to work for only if your in the right store following best practices. With the Target culture you gain experience into owning your business.
bad,"Management is one of the worst I've work with, you as a team member have to do management job with a BAD salary, abuse to team members is their main problem. The only good thing is most of the team members that work there are amazing and help each other since management does nothing to help."
bad,"stock.attendant"
bad,Great entry level. Not a lot of people in the security industry really work here.
bad,In seven years of being apart of the Target culture. The first six years were wonderful. Management made sure the team was happy. Over the last year almost everyone that has been the more that seven years start quitting. Because management completely forgot how to treat the team and I believe that's because of the new store director.
bad,"A typical day at Target for me, were folding clothes all day. I learned all the departments like where everything goes and are located. Management's horrible at the store, but my co-workers are the best hardworking team you could ask for. They're amazing. The hardest part of the job was trying to get everything done in a four hour shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was going on break."
bad,"I was not properly trained, they just threw me on a register, I would have thought being someone dealing with money they would want to make sure I was knowledgeable, however that was not the case. Customers on a daily basis express the poor attitude from the employees. When i asked to switch my hours from day to night they said no, without even questioning if school or prior arraignments would be a reason. One of the GSTL'S their is extremely perverted to the guests and employees. ""Twerking"" throughout the store, asking personal perverted questions, and just making everyone feel uncomfortable. When brought up to supervisors, they apparently didn't care enough to look into it. This company is not at all what your training says it is. They operate completely the opposite. All GSTL'S you are to report too are rude, and bring personal business into the workplace. They claim to have competitive pay rates but that is not the case, even if you are lucky to get a decent pay, they just cut your hours."
bad,"My job was seasonal so I don't really have a review for Target. I know that this job for me offered fun for the Christmas holiday, and it offered me a chance to meet great people."
bad,Management are nothing but bullies who push team members around. Team members are given few hours to get loads of work done with 0 compensation. I would not recommend working there to anyone!
bad,"A typical work day for me starts out slow then picks up. I've learned how to check for items for guests, handle difficult situations due to not enough staffing, how to set tables and shelves, and good customer service. The management is not all that there where it should be; it lacks alot of communication. My co-workers are fun to be around they get me through the work day. The hardest part of the job is at night when we are busy and don't have enough people. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people that i work with."
bad,Working at target help you learn the merchandise and making sure you price the merchandise. Also teach you about fast working.
bad,If I could give it a negative review I would. I started as a cashier and moved to Food Avenue. Target highers managers strait out of collage. They don't care what your degree is in you just have to have a degree. Management would cover for one another. My team lead got sick and they expected me to step up and fill her shoes but didn't tell me. So when she comes back I was given a write up saying I should have stepped up to be the team lead. Realizing it was telling me I was a team lead I signed it waited a week and started demanding a raise to go with my title. They ask what title I showed them the paper work they looked at it sent me away met with the manager then the report disappeared I would take things to the manager and she would yell at me. The store manager would cover for lower management I got some stuff in and had to go get it from a freezer but there was a box of spray oil its in a pressurized can it had been in the freezer for at least 24 hours this was a big no no. I was told if some one did it they could get fired so when I found it I put it in a place where if it popped it wouldn't hurt any one. then I reported it to the manger she ask me what I wanted her to do about it. I said I want her to take care of it if it blows up it could kill me she said nothing. They had out side companies come in and try to tell us what we are doing wrong but disregarded all the problems caused by Target cross contamination being the biggest. I couldn't wish people a merry christmas or wear a santa or even an elf hat
bad,too much work for little pay. no hours to compensate for the pay rate
bad,"Poor hours, poor pay, bad attitudes from leadership (work fast, don't talk, countermanding own instructions...), incompetence, unsafe work conditions (equipment/shelves in storage falling on head with management not doing anything about it)."
bad,A typical day at work was unorganized. there are to many bosses that send you in different ways therefor not to much gets accomplished.my co workers and I have great relationships. the hardest part of the job is the bosses. The best part of my job is dealing with the public.
bad,It is not somewhere you should want to retire from. Was not my favorite job. Going to work everyday was a nuisance. Co-workers were cool and loved them like family. Managers take credit for the hardwork that team members do. I hated that store.
bad,i loved my job at target. it has its up's and down moments. the boss was ok. it was a company i could show my skills
bad,"poor leadership, hire right out of college with no leadership skills."
bad,"a job i  wont  reccomend,  if your a teen, in schol and  need some money Bi-weekly then here you are"
bad,"This diet program offered massage an incentive for those clients who were able to lose weight. But there was no schedule guarantee, and therapists didn't get paid if they weren't doing a massage."
bad,"i d k"
bad,"Imagine working all day on a display and having some children run up and destroy it, or folding hundreds of shirts and pants just to have someone come and mess it up. Then you turn to them and say ""thank you"". I get that it is the nature of that particular business, but as a human, that gets old. Working long hours on holidays instead of spending time with my family got old too. The store management was non-existent, I rarely saw the manager. The team leads (which I was one of) were just as miserable as I was. "
bad,"stocking all night long"
bad,"Working for Target wasn't what they said,instead the focused was on the its employees. The company drives them like they are slaves without compassion or care, and when employes became sick there was no understanding of family emergencies or even physical health. Trying to get time off was like the battle of Gettysburg, and their is no doubt that this company is filled with racism, favoritism and even a hostile work environment.The company doesn't encourage team work, or even a family environment, the mission about being focused on customer service is just words on a page, because employes are disciplined for actually providing customer service to the customers and their safety. "
bad,I did not like the store or anything about working there. When i first started there everything was fine. But then i needed a day off and they complained about it. The store wasn't a fun place to work at 
bad,I hated every minute of working here. The managment was poor and borderline verbally abusive.
bad,i hated working here that's why i went to walgreens. Everything was horrible even the hours. their not flexible with work schedules at all.
bad,Management doesn't care about their employees. Its a terrible place to work. They lie cheat and steal and give you the lowest wages they possibly can.
bad,"  Witnessed employees using and distributing illegal drugs on company property during work hours, numerous times, and management's only response was to give the guilty parties more responsibilities and more hours.  Was told it was under investigation but nothing was ever done to end the behavior.  Other employees witnessed the same activity, even employees from other Winchester Target.  "
bad,i hated working there the management sucks and getting yelled at by people is not my ideal fun coworkers were ok 
bad,Working for Target has truely been a challenge.  I have semie-enjoyed my time here but I need to advance to a position where I can have benefits as well as increase in my salary for the hard work that I put in.
bad,"My job at Target is the worst ever. Every day is a day of passive aggressive behavior to deal with for no reason. When you walk through the doors of my Target your whole day instantly sucks. The job and the people are great but when it comes down to management, they are the worst. None of the Etls at my store have degrees in business or anything to do with business, so none of them know what their doing. Every response to questions are I don't know, but yet they get upset if an employee doesn't know something that they should know. This is a place I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. You can bend over backwards for Target and it will never be appreciated no matter what it is. SO spread the word don't work at Target."
bad,"very fun place to work but not enough hours given to live on , my raise was 13 cents"
bad,"need more employees and more friendly people also management"
bad,"Low wage and little hours equals horrible pay. Snobbish attitudes of management and co-workers. Hard work for little to no return. Cheesy ""Brand"" outlook that is demanded of team members. Expect to work every significant holiday for a whole dollar an hour more than your base wage. Horrible benefits package in that you won't be able to afford them. Good team cards and Star Performers of the month awards are a joke as only the ""pets"" get them."
bad,I work in the cash office from 7:00 am til 10:30 and supervise and staff of cashiers and front end team members. I have learned patience and understanding of the guests needs. Hardest part is working with members who are not on the same philosophy as target. The most enjoyable is the interaction with the guests.
bad,the company in general might not be bad but the store i worked for was terrible.
bad,"I have been working for Target for a year now and just got my yearly review. I work full time and go to school. Though Target is flexible with my hours, their ""team culture"" is anything but. The team lead in charge of my department has refused to transfer or advance me to a different department as a result of my conversion score (you need a green conversion to transfer in her view) and has refused my transferring or cross training even with a consistent green conversion. On my overall review I was given Inconsistently Effective which means- not there on time, doesn't meet job requirements, etc. I am there on time every day, consistently meet job requirements, spend extra time and effort to make sure team members feel valued and welcomed and this is how they treat me."
bad,Target is the ABSOLUTE WORSE PLACE TO WORK! Again unless your management target is a slave plantation. You start off making minimum wage around 7.50 a hour and you never get a raise or any chance for promotions. Team leads and managers work you like slaves and have you push heavy furniture out to customers cars. You hear every customer complaint and a customer can cuss you out and the managers will sit there and do nothing. The customers also have this you are my slave mentality. You have to clean out carts for all items and a lot of times with no help. You also have to clean up every spill that customers purposely knock on the floor. The managers keep you past midnight after your shift with no overtime just to be spiteful. The managers stay in your personal lives and start drama with team members.
bad,"Ok work, they need to think how hot it gets inside the trucks and provide water for employees."
bad,a typical day is doing the same repetitive stuff! I cross-trained in every department and then my hours got cut severely and they changed management too much and they were not experienced and did not know what they were doing! I hated that place and I tried to stick it out as long as I possibly could
bad,This is the worst company I have worked for by far. The managment has no care for its employees and is only driven to cut hours and raises are non existant.
bad,Extremely unprofessional management. Hard work is not rewarded. Compensation is absolutely dreadful. Three years of working there was three years too much.
bad,"The company and its employees were all great to work for. I enjoyed everything I did for them. The hours were difficult, I normally worked 4 am to 1pm. I always had a great review, and would have stayed if not offered more money by I-Force."
bad,I enjoy working in a fast pace enviornment. Some may feel that it is stressful but I like the feeling of urgency when I work.
bad,Compensation was too low for amount of work; management did not seem to care about employees; most co-workers were lazy and got away with it; almost daily overtime
bad,"you have to know a member of management to get an interview, no job security at all"
bad,The job has weird hours and you don't get paid too much. Good summer job for teenagers.
bad,I have nothing to say really. I wouldn't work for them in the near future. Maybe if i worked at another Target i would probably feel different.
bad,Would not reccomend employment into target.... Manager/supervisor are sexist and rude.
bad,"I gave this place 2 1/2 years of my time and got let go because of some ""He said, She said"" BS. I was constantly one of their top performers yet the HR didnt like me so i got cut. Other managers told me they wanted me to move up and take the assistant position for my department when the current assistant moved up but the HRs personal issue with me killed it. The pay sucks, the management lies and will intentionally screw you if they dont like you. Overall, this is by far the most unprofessional work environment ive ever seen."
bad,The management in this place is not fair and they do not even care what an employee has to say.
bad,"Basically they get these young kids just graduated college with no experience in management to come in as a supervisor because they have a degree. The thing is they get that superiority complex and they treat people like trash. 99% of the time these people are canned because they get bad reviews or whatever, but th cycle continues because they want that degree."
bad,A typical day would be when you clock in you have a meeting going over the goals and expectations for the day. After the meeting we would work on our assigned areasof the store.
bad,"I worked as a Front Lanes Supervisor (GSA), in Cash Office, Cart Attendant, Softlines and Hardlines Sales Floor Team Member; trained my GSTL after I put in for the position and found out later on she was hired on making $15+ an hour doing one position while I juggled atleast 5 positions a shift at 8.15 an hour as a supervisor as well as getting repeated ""Employee of the Month"", and ""Great Team Hero"" of our region. As Cart Attendant our ""Automatic Cart Pusher"" was broken upon me being hired and was still broken when I turned in my two week notice, pushing carts in the southern humid 100+ degree summer days by hand is extremely dangerous. Nearly suffered a heat stroke on one occasion, called in the next day and was begged to come in for my shift even against doctors recomendation. Told over time would be allowed upon being hired, then not allowed to work over time. If you do not brown nose managment, usually a reason was found to fire you. Corrective action was never taken on the employees that really needed it and as a supervisor I was denied the authority to do so. Only 2 out of all of our ETLs even knew what they were doing."
bad,The company is fine but the individuals who run the company are the worst people to ever be associated with. The benefits are not in the employee's favor being that Target is the insurance company.
bad,hated working there low pay and over worked no over time the only thing good about that job was the break room which is not important when it comes to needing pay to pay for bills
bad,a typical day at work
bad,"Worst job I've ever had in my life. Worked a hard-lines position, which basically means being responsible for re-shelving items and the organization/upkeep of your designated area, assisting customers, and back-up cashiering. worked specifically in toys, electronics, and Seasonal, or whichever area needed the most work and upkeep."
bad,"Places merchandise in bins, on floor, or on shelves, according to identifying information"
bad,"I informed different members of management about different safety violations, I was ignored everytime. I was told that the broken cardboard collection cages had to be used the way they were manufactured, even if they were falling apart, I was wanting to try to ensure they would not hurt somebody severely."
bad,Depending on which target you work at you may have different feelings my supervisor was not responsible and did not do her job at all. I was made the trainer of the department but did not receive my pay increase and when I did it was only seven cents.
bad,The comapny was good and had great values when i first started working for them in 2005. Since then priority is given to those with a degree even if they have no experience. They expect those who they are unwilling to promote because of lack of a degree to train new hires who have a degree and pay those with out considerably less. You can have 20 years of experience but if you dont have a degree you only valuable till you are able to train someone else in what you do and have learned over you years and then you are expendable.
bad,"selling phones getting customers to switch their phone plans to a higher plan, convincing customers to start a new contract, closing and opening kiosk, counting the cash register depositing money to the bank"
bad,"Worked for them overnight for store re-model and got 40 hours a week. Management including a district manager took us to breakfast after the final overnight shift and right afterwards I was thrown into 12-18 hour weeks doing truck/trailer unloading work. They'll make it seem promising and then drop you on your head. No advancement opportunity, wouldn't advise working here at all. (Oh. Also randomly got placed onto the schedule to help them with inventory preparation and never got thanked.)"
bad,the job at target was cool i mea i had a job so i had money.i just felt that the manager could have been a little more open to what makes a good shopping experiece.
bad,"didn,t like how i was treated but job was easy i was a cashier i liked that very good in numbers"
bad,"Terrible managers, no availble hours when hiring people, no benefits, mistreated, unfair management, complelety rude managers, horrible managing skills, over all the worst place to work for."
bad,"If your a college student, a retiree, or someone who needs something on the side this is the job for you. Every store is run differently so it all depends on management. Typical day I go in do some reshop and I go home.. Occasionally I help with other departments and often do some customer service and help people to the best of my abilities. Unfortunately the store could be run better so no one knows much about anything and since its often understaffed you have people in departments having no clue how to do their jobs effectively or with any prior customer service experience.. or language skills for that matter"
bad,The staff wasnt really professional. it was alot of gossip and employee drama. the management wasnt professional they were friends with the employees. and took part in making fun of other co workers.. i enjoyed seeing the smiles on the guest faces when i worked and i love making money.
bad,"Overnight stock is really fun and you get to work with great people. Day side though is a different story, if anything falls while your on a ladder they expect you to jump off the ladder to grab it before it touches the ground. If you don't you get fired and black listed. STAY AWAY"
bad,a very uneasy place to work very negative especially towards certain individuals
bad,"We get to work and start with our redundent tasks. The leadership does very little to contribute to the overall product. Part of our job is to always assist the guest. I always assist the guest, I never stop assisting till the guest is satisfied. The pay is horrable. The more that I learn other jobs here, there is no compensation for it. I just gain more of a work load with the expectance to performe these task in the same amount of time."
bad,Extreamly overworked for the amount of business you had to perform on a daily basis. The company expected more with less support and with no payroll to perform the standard they wanted to maintain. Talk about a stressful life style daily. As soon as they are done with you they find a way to push you out.
bad,"A typical day at work stocking, restocking and helping customers."
bad,"managers on an ego trip, very into who's who, and what department you work in matters on how your treated"
bad,"working overnight at target was always confusing cause of so much unnessecery authority. while working there i did learn how to manager personalities and become a better multitasker. management was hardly ever satisfied with our work results, i understand the method of not giving a worker to much praise but some acknowledgement of accomplishments builds confidence. the hardest part of the job after awhile was wanting to go in everynight and the most enjoyable part was my coworkers cause we became one anothers support system"
bad,There is no Salary Incentives and having no future Growth prospectives.
bad,"A typical day at work is ""Do everything and get yelled at for it"". No matter how many tasks are completed in a timely fashion, or how many customer recognition forms are filled out with your name on them, the Target I work at *does not recognize you for it*. You help customers, clean the shelves, push merchandise to the shelves, deal with incompetent managers, often end up doing your own thing after ignoring said incompetent managers, and pray to God the store manager doesn't target you arbitrarily for abuse."
bad,I stocked products and was backup cashier. Always had at least 5 different people telling me what I should be doing even if they weren't management.
bad,No matter how hard you work at this place it will never be good enough to them.
bad,"Some target stores I guess are okay, I also think it depends on the people that work there . Other than that they pay you nothing and work you to death. Treat you bad too"
bad,typical day at work would be to open up my register and start cleaning my cashier area until customers started arriving. I learnd the basic retail skills of customer service. My management were great tought me the job well. There wasent any real hard part in this job. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people
bad,"Put merchandise on the shelves, nice co worker. But no room for advancement unless you were in close with management team."
bad,This company portrays to have deep values but they truly only care about how much money they make. The management (atleast where I worked at) did not care about their employees at all.
bad,- Manage the day-to-day operations of the logistics team (early morning/overnight and backroom teams)
bad,"Target was the worst place to work at. Whenever breaks and lunches were needed, the GSA's or GSTL's did not want to relieve us. It makes no sense to have people in charge of the front and they weren't trained in all areas of the front of the store. They did not like letting people who were trained in certain areas of the store to get off the lanes to help out. They were slow and whenever we were backed up and we called for help, no one ever came. A lot of people of higher power were of no help either. Working for target is the worst place to work for. They really don't care for you. They pay so little just for you to do so much. If your thinking about working there, think twice before you fill out that application. If your going to do it, keep it as a part time and find a full time somewhere else. Don't fall for the training videos. Its much more different in reality."
bad,"I was hired in as a ""Warehouse Worker"" at the Target Distribution Center in Galesburg, Michigan. I worked in ""Receiving"" or ""Inbound"" scanning the inbound freight, with a ""RF"" (Radio Frequency) Unit, and then staging the merchandise in the appropriate area of the Distribution Center. HOWEVER, I was never told of the Work Requirements! In order to keep my job there, I had to unload & scan at least 2000 Boxes of freight EVERY NIGHT! That's right, TWO THOUSAND BOXES, (many times of floor-loaded items, not even up on pallets so you could get a R.C. (standing lift) under it! To put things in perspective, many semi-trailers don't even have over 2000 Boxes on the entire trailer! So if you can't unload, (by hand) over 2000 Boxes of freight, they give you a Map of I-94! That's right, they'll FIRE you on the spot. That place is a revolving door! Target goes through more employees than Imelda Marcos went through shoes! They treated me like garbage. To this day, I NEVER buy anything at The Target Corporation. The Target Corporation is a perfect example of what is wrong with Amerika!"
bad,"drama, drama, drama, adults that act like children. not the place to be."
bad,"The one I worked at least. My typical day started with unloading a 53 ft. Trailer stuffed full of individual boxes from very small to XLarge not many pallets just paper products (Paper towels, Toilet paper,Some dog foods) mostly boxes. Now that wouldn't be that bad usually, I like working, and I' am No stranger to Lifting heavy objects, From Steel To Boxes full of bolts, nuts, axles, drums etc... Never have I had 1hrs 30mins to unload 1800 individual boxes from a truck trailer with one other person. Then 2hrs 30mins To stock all of the unloaded item & stock any remainder in back so the floor was empty when it opens. I have unloaded trucks & stocking in the past at different companies, Truthfully the other companies I kind of enjoyed the job, That would be the reason I took that job. While I like a challenge, usually we were on time or close with the unloading, the sorting Transporting to areas, stocking I think we ever were able to meet that goal even with 20 other people working on stocking. Every where else I worked in unloading & Stocking for the amount of freight about 8 hrs. To complete, A goal we made almost every day. There was a small amount of times the goal was not met. If you don't think the amount of time given to do a job, should at least be obtainable. Than this is the job for you. I Have asked around Not all have this problem, I don't know How they do things today. I have not been back to that branch since."
bad,Spent 6 months with this corporation being harrassed by supervisors and senior employees for reasons of no true value.
bad,I give them a bad rating i worked there for twelve years it was okay when i first started but got worse every year i stayed the people are okay some of them anyway but you have to put up with managers being to friendly with certain team members no work being done dont get me wrong i loved what i did in Receiving i have learned not to make friends im there to do my job that is it a typical day at this job was stressful.
bad,This was a very unstable work environment. Unfair discipline practices. Extra hours given through favoretism.
bad,Did not like working there. Corporation makes promises that they do not keep
bad,"The job was easy, shouldn't have been paid though every two weeks. I didn't really like this job but it paid the bills. It was an inbetween job."
bad,regular
bad,"A typical day slow & boring, didn't learn anything, management is horrible, my co-workers are messy, didn't enjoy the job fake advertisement."
bad,"The management team was awful, they didn't accommodate the needs for me"
bad,i dont really remember was ok when it was there would go back if i had a chance
bad,Don't care about anything but themselves very bad company to work for..I mean slave for
bad,After almost 7 years i was fired for being to slow. There were no problems before some new etl and team leads came along. I was singled out. I went to human resources and told them about the problems. HR stated they would talk to them. Everything got worseIt turned into retibution. Hr did not do a thingI know its my word against theirs.So eventually i was fired . Thats all i have to say .
bad,This is by far THE Worst job I've ever had. They don't appreciate my hard work and go out of their way to find negative FALSE things about my work. They favor the new WHITE employees by giving them more hours and also more oppurtunities. They didn't even give me a raise AND they wait months to give me redicilous write ups. A typical day at work consists of me breaking my back to unload boxes and stock crazy amounts of merchandise in an unreasonable period of time. The management walk around all day criticizing but doing no work besides joking around with each other. I've learned that blatant discrimination does will exist. My coworkers are like a bunch of teenage girls that gossip and tattle tale all day. The most enjoyable part of my day is going home at 930am and the hardest is getting out of bed at 3am to go do hard manual labor in a hostile environment at 4 in the morning
bad,"I worked for target during the Christmas season. Started off as a frontline cashier was transfered to the Cafe. At the time the supervisor advised me that I would be hired on permanent after my 90 days. While the Monday after black Friday as I was going to my work station, going down the escalator a customer put a shopping cart on the escalator and let go and the cart came flying down which hit me. While I wont go into details but I had to demand to go seek medical attention. After that I was treated differently and some of the teamleaders were mean and rude to me. While I was laid off and it was due to the fact I was on Workmans Comp. But of course they will not say that. My experience as employee was horrible even before I got hurt."
bad,"I have low regards when it comes to target. I got hired there in october for a solid position that I was told upon being hired was ""Not seasonal"". They said they were ok when people called in sick or needed sometime off and no one would get in trouble for it. During those 4 months I was there I called in sick once had to spend over 3 hours calling the office before anyone one answered and then they were out right rude when i explained what was wrong. In december my grandmother passed away i was denied off for her funeral, but got to listen how a few employees asked off for the same day got the day for for a beer cruise through the kansas city area while i had to work over almost 20 hours that day? The day after christmas I was let go with the rest of the seasonal employees even though i was told upon hiring I was not seasonal same day they were interviewing new employees they told us they couldnt afford us. I find the only good part about target was the breaks and free food they provided employees. I would never suggest though any one looking for a professional job apply through them."
bad,Target is not a very sercured job to have when sales are down target constantly cuts hours the management at target are not very understanding if you get hurt on job you will be fired not a good comapny to work for ....
bad,normaly unload 2-3 trucks a night
bad,It was ok at 1st untill they slaved me and then fired me when they didnt need my labor anymore. and i wasnt seasonal eithr...
bad,they dont pay good you cant pay your bills you will work 3-4 hours and they will send you home. too many bosses. i had 4 bosses on the nite shift.
bad,very underpaid job with no great benefits but I worked in a very diverse working environment with somewhat nice people.
bad,Target is a good company to work for but the management could be better and the store could be cleaner.
bad,"This has probably been one of the worst jobs I have ever had. Target employees gave my position no support whatsoever, I had to beg and plea to get things researched so I had product to sell."
bad,"They did not like employees looking to cross train into other departments, they did not support advancement, they did not support higher employee education, they did not support employees helping other employees on the job, they did not like employees taking initiative. Essentially, it is not a company I would ever recommend anyone work for, unless they really one the very definition of a dead-end job, without any support of anykind from superiors."
bad,"this place was for white people to advance only white team leads only, the regular worker mostly somalian is treated like garbage the harder people work the more LOD's put you in the hardest areas to work in .I worked the night shift and instead of letting the people have free food or bread from the bakearythe store would throw it away.only one drink was free once a week .the bosnian team members were the prefered even if a newer person did something better for example ""stationary"" the team lead would simply add the better hard working new employee to that section and the results would always make the older and lazier with higher pay per hour people look good.the lazy women would stay longer to make more money not to help finish.someone should bother to check the overnight cameras for employees' true worth."
bad,"I worked at target for just about two years, along with another year seasonal. I took a leave not knowing when I would be moving and called them to let them know I was moving and would not be back. They acted as if I did not call and put it down as if I was fired. I cared for the company and wanted to go back when I moved but now I cant cause someone was mad that I left."
bad,"For starters I was not trained properly. I hadn't been shown where our restocking areas were so could never grab supplies, when I had asked for the whereabouts I was still never shown. My schedule requirements were not made so I had to work days that I requested off. On my off days I was constantly called in for short shifts that made driving to and from cost more than I made. Management staff members were the most difficult to find, food avenue was under staffed, under trained, and I could never find someone to cover even part of a shift with only 4 members having training in the area. Team members made gossip more important than thier job duties, nor did many of them care for the customers' needs or comfort. I was let go prior to my 90 day period with the remark of not being eligable as a long term employee, yet there were new team members in that day."
bad,"If you know anything about Target, you would know it's slogan is ""Expect more, pay less."" That is true all around. At Target, the more you get paid, the less you are expected to do. The expectations at Target are to always ""challenge upwards"" and to ""coach each other."" In other words, It is up to the employees who get paid less than 35k a year to make better business decisions than your managers who are younger than you with no retail experience. When coworkers don't uphold their duties, it is then delegated to you to carry their workload with no compensation."
bad,they pay you 13 an hour but only give you  12 hours a week is its like you making  what you would make getting payed like 8-9 an hour so not worth  ...better to get payed 10- 11 an hr and work full time somewhere else. ...because  you would make more money than at target
bad,Didn't care about employees. When I joined I was to get a dollar bonus because of the area I work at which was food. Didn't get it at all. Whenever we had employee BBQs or gathering I was never told or was schedule on days they weren't doing anything. It was a very sucky place to work.
bad,I was hired as seasonal. I tried to prove myself to this store so I could be kept permanently however after working there two months I didn’t want to stay this location and I quite. I’m proud of the work I put in in all my jobs. I’m always staying on task but regardless I was made to feel unappreciated unrecognized by 75% of employees including management. I was only given 12 hours a week. Working here was a waste of my time.
bad,"I can't even describe how unhelpful the 'team leaders' are at Target. It's a joke. I would avoid Target at all costs. The pay may seem great, but they tend to compensate for it by cutting your hours significantly. Source: I only averaged 12 hours a week after a year, despite get good reviews from guests and my area's team lead."
bad,"Only for teenagers. If you aren't a manager, don't work here. If you are a manager, chances are you are an entitled, hapless moron. Fine work for kids or temporary work."
bad,"Working at Target isn't what you imagine. Management plays favorites, when talking to the GM about any concerns or schedule problems they try to reassure but don't get anything done. That's just a few things and some Targets are different."
bad,"This company does not promote from within. Management is usually staffed with recent college graduates that have a degree from any accredited college in any field. This leads to poor management and communication because of the lack of experience. Over the years, this company has gone downhill. Employees are not valued, get no hours, and the stores are beginning to look messy as a result."
bad,Extreme high school environment. It’s who you’re buddies with not your work ethic. Employee happiness is not on the list of priorities. Understaffed. Understaffed. Understaffed.
bad,"Target may sound like a fun place to work but it is vastly under-staffed in most departments which lead to a miserable over-worked environment for most employees. Only 2 managers for 200 plus employees. Managers could care less about suggestions or complaints that would productively help the company, workers and ultimately the customer (guests). Expectations were un reasonable, and Zebra inventory system was wrong approximately 20-30 percent of the time. The hiring process was also convoluted, confusing, and you had to agree to numerous terms of employment which you were not given ample enough time to review. "
bad,HR is an absolute joke. None of them know how to do their jobs. They pay the people who stock their shelves the same as loss provention. Not very smart. Plus it takes a year as a full time employee to get any benefits.
bad,"You are expected to do leads work without getting compensated for it. As hard as you work it will still not be enough, due to favoritism. Your work will not be recognized."
bad,The pay is nice but that is only if they give you hours and they only give the favorites their hours it doesn't matter if you are a good worker or not! Almost all the team leads spend their entire shift talking to each other or doing the bare minimum. Most days I felt discouraged after work because of how poorly they treat you. There is no inside promotion. HR is a joke they don't care about the team members safety.
bad,"Worst and most angry management I have ever experienced, I have worked many jobs, because I actually love working and like trying new things. but this was the worst job I have EVER had. I DO NOT recommend."
bad,"The management was rude, disrespectful and not understanding when I had a medical emergency.They threatened my job because I was 2 minutes late when I had an emergency doctors appointment, even though I informed them ahead of time of the situation and that I may be a minute or two late."
bad,A lot could be solved by better management. They don’t care unless they need something from you. Not enough hours. Wouldn’t recommend working here....
bad,"Seriously Target is not an ideal place to work for unless you are desperate and seriously in need! I would RATE management a ZERO on the stars if I could only because I worked at two different Targets (Alameda & North Hayward) and it was the WORST! "
bad,"They act like they have people's best interests at heart, but you are truly just a number. I was hired on as a seasonal employee, but I was the first person to get cut (out of the blue) despite working harder than any of the other hires in my department. It was absolutely baffling to me. They don't take any time to learn how hard each of their employees work at all. There are too many lazy, unintelligent people working there (who can't even interact with customers) that get plenty of hours. Expect to be a work horse and nothing more."
bad,"I always had to guess what work had to be done and couldn't reliably count on management. Always needed help up front but never scheduled enough people to fill in. Expected my hours to go up during the holiday season but I got shifts cut and hours reduced,"
bad,"I didn’t think after my last job I would find one that was worse, I was wrong. Target was the worst job I have ever had. It took a toll on me physically and mentally. Management is awful and demoralizing. We constantly have people quitting the store in tears because management screams at them on the floor. Lucky to have someone last 1-2 months. HR won’t do anything about bad Team leads, even when an entire department complains."
bad,"Nobody does their job, like, ever. Most of the time, everyone else’s work becomes YOUR work and no body cares. When you answer the phone and the guest asks for a manager, and you transfer it to a manager, the manager always gives you attitude like “why did you transfer it to me?” This company does not value your ideas and is full of children who act like your manager (when they aren’t). If I act this way, I get yelled at. When they act this way, they’re given praise. It’s a job full of favoritism!"
bad,I did all I could and got fired for calling in for a sick day. Target overall is a good place to work it’s just that the management sucks and don’t care about their employees.
bad,"No training beyond orientation and mirroring other ""advocates"" for ~1.5 hrs;  spend 2 mos as a newbie doing great with ""guests"" but getting yelled at by other ""advocates"" for how you're wrong. It's no wonder they don't give you a nametag up front, most ""advocates"" disappear after week 1. Three good employees just walked off the job within the past week. Kiss some behind and you'll be fine."
bad,After countless empty promises of advancing my career and or salary at target I feel like I wasted a few years of my life with a company that could care less about their employees well being. Management could care less especially when team members spread things around such as ring worm. Would not recommend.
bad,Politics rampant in this company was treated like a mule workhorse and being salary expected to stay late and all hours  almost imo. Constant pressure  and no sense of communication.
bad,"Target as a whole seems to be on the right track, but my location is full of lazy, partially engaged management and lacks effective communication. Each manager has different priorities that they expect the lower level employees to meet, and it seems like they barely even talk to each other. I'm rarely able to complete any task I begin on any given day because I am pulled to start or help with something else. Something as simple as scheduled biweekly 15 minutes management meetings would easily remedy the chaos and at least get everyone on the same page, but it seems like they only communicate all together when there is a massive issue in the store. Which is usually related to online orders."
bad,"I worked at Target for 3 months.  When I applied, I lived close by, but shortly thereafter was forced to move to a place with VERY limited bus service.  ( I don't have a car.)  We're talking like one bus every 2 hours WHEN they are on time...so because of this, I was late like 3 times, and so, because I was a ""seasonal"" hire, they let me go after my 3 months, even though, and I told them this, I had recently moved back to the city where Target was, and could once again easily get to work...didn't seem to matter to them...very impersonal, and I did a GREAT job for them...and the customers LOVED me..."
bad,There was too many chiefs and not enough respect shown to the floor staff working their butts off. Before they went bankrupt in Canada I left after 3 years of  wasted time.
bad,I worked so hard and improved so much and I tried to move up and they never let me move up but they let others who hadn't been there as long as me move up. Unfair treatment and everyone is judgemental.
bad,"It’s only a decent place to work. They demand SO much but are unwilling to provide the support staff to fulfill the company goals."
bad,"One good this is there always seemed to be free food in the breakroom!! I did learn a lot from working at this job. Received $4/hr in wage increases since I started over 4 years ago. Loved this place when I first started working there. Up until about 2 years ago there was a major switch in team leads and the place started going downhill with ""modernization"". But the store is extremely micro managed. Not fair across the board to all team members. Team leads are extremely lazy. Oh and the store leader is very two-faced and condescending. Also if you're great at brown-nosing, this job is an excellent match for you!"
bad,"Like working at Target was pretty easy, but with horrible team leads and management it made working there miserable and depressing. We couldn’t leave or go home because we were understaffed and forced to stay til everything was “100%”. They wondered why people just left after two weeks."
bad,Target used to be a great company to work for about 15 years ago.  Management was kind to the employees; we were a family.  Fast forward to present time; my niece went to work for them and they fired her after only 5 days of working for them.  During her training time she became seriously sick; had to go to emergency.  Doctor gave her a note for 3 days off.  Didn’t matter.  Bad company.  That’s the reason I quit.
bad,"Pay is great, but you do not get many hours.  No benefits.  Poor leadership.  Poor training.  Zero feedback.  You only b hear when you have done something wrong which happens frequently.  They micro-manage your every minute.  Lots of other people's pricing mistakes affect you and you are never appreciated for reporting that which happen often.  Maybe they are intentional?"
bad,"Don't  waste your time if you want to have a reliable job. Mothers, daughters, brothers, and sisters, ar all employed in the same store. Good luck with equality."
bad,I worked at Target for over 7yrs. The management there is redicilois.. the leaders literally don't do anything and they treat there employees that they are garbage.. I'm a tiny girl that unloaded the trucks and everything. Never once moved up in the company but was usedand abuse overamd over again.. this place will make u go crazy.. and u will definitely hate working there..
bad,"Working here for me was worst decision i ever made and should of realized it from the beginning. I went to interview for cashier and quickly got moved to electronics interview followed by interview for LOD. Was asked to come back next day and when i did managers attitude was way different than day before and said he’d prefer to hire internally for LOD, but why make me go for second interview then.  He either way guaranteed me a job and now i would be working in toys department. Got hired and working a few days i was asked to cover electronics but in my department there was no radio and electronics guy gave me keys only not his radio. Either way I was back-and-forth between toys and electronics. Find myself selling a game but since I wasn’t cashier train, i walked them to the registers so a cashier could cash them out.  as I’m walking back a cart pusher stop me asked me if I was covering electronics and yelled at me for not having a radio. Disrespected and overwhelmed I shrugged and explain to him I didn’t have a radio. Cart pusher gets offended and started to yell for a manager over radio and yells at me “don’t move” “stay right there”. I was called into office and given multiple talking too for something i didn’t know being new. This was the first time of 3 encounters i had with management second one was 2 weeks after that when they were only scheduling me weekend i went and got a second job. Target HR was mad because it wouldn’t work out with them they had first dibs on my hours even though they only scheduled me weekends. She refused to allow me to change my availability."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend target to the living or died. The work environment is an absolute joke. Management(team leader) works employees to the dirt, all while expecting you to treat them as royalty. Benefits? Targets benefits are the worst, don't get me started on their 10% employee discount. My time with target was the absolute worst! If I could give them 0 stars I would."
bad,"Was fun in 2017, before all the changes (for the worst), before all the favoritism was being shown, before all the new management showed they didn't care. There are no real Leadership in store 1059. Leadership spreads your business to other people, HR does not want to hear your problems, ETL's let certain people get away with everything and then they cut your hours so bad it makes it seem like they want you to quit. Story of my life lol...one big JOKE. Word of advice, stay away from this store."
bad,"I can't comment on Target as a company, but at the employee level, it's atrocious.  Management cares more about getting REDcard sign-ups (which is a bad idea, don't get one) then their employess, and will threaten to fire employees for not getting enough."
bad,"Interestingly enough I am extremely grateful for my job at Target, but working there is so stressful! Its not the guest or task that are stressful, its my coworkers and management! I get bad mouthed by both and they pile the work of 2 to 3 people on me! On top of that, certain tasks can be done efficiently, but when my team leads are around they have me do my tasks a different way which doubles or triples the completion time, I comply in fear of getting in trouble!e"
bad,this was part time job for me had a time limited to do job in which if you didn't complete the manager would be very mad and disrespectful they would kick you out once a certain time hit
bad,"Only two good managers. Favoritism , jealousy, in this store. I just loved one manager in particular. Females were horrible to work with. To much favoritism."
bad,"The HR chose who she showed favoritism to. No respect. They refused to work through issues. No accommodations. Work performance & ethic didn't matter if you weren't a favorite. Perfect example: I trained someone on everything they knew, promotion came up and I was surpassed and the job was given to my trainee. Myself and other qualified coworkers weren't even given a fair chance at or notice of the position until after job was filled by personally selected individual. When I inquired as to why, I WAS GIVEN NO REASON AS TO WHY. Absolutely NO SENIORITY. Tampering of time-off etc. Unjust terminations.  Overall shady management. VERY HIGH TURN OVER RATE."
bad,It was like they went to the nearest preschool and gave job offers to people who couldn’t fathom doing anything and taking ownership on what task were needing to be done.
bad,"The Target that I worked at was every cliché for high school all wrapped up in one retail location. Management was young, which was not the issue. It was a lack of professional management experience. The management team was not shy of speaking their""mean girl"" opinion of other (all) department managers. The complete disregard of HR guidelines, or Target guidelines for team members were thrown out the window. Team members were afraid to voice any concern due to fear of retaliation from their manager. No HR conversation with any manager was followed by any confidentiality security. if any concern was addressed the complete team knew, and it became a bigger issue. I would not recommend this company to anyone looking for employment. To Target, a team member is just another number or cow in the cattle run."
bad,"Great people, poor management. Management treats you like you’re just a piece in the machine, easily replaceable. Ask all the right questions but then do nothing to fix the problems."
bad,"management has a hard time communicating with each other, much less the employees. play favoritism, some managers are easier to get along with than others. HR has no idea what they’re doing and won’t own up to the mistakes and wrong information they tell people. lead me to lose many (unpaid) hours due to a funeral and lost my respect for the management in general."
bad,"The management is terrible, they are a bunch of young adults acting like they have been in the business for decades. don't get paid enough for the bs."
bad,I worked at a few locations and this location was the worst one. It's a very hostile work environment I spoke with HR about my concerns and they didn't address the situations in a professional manner
bad,"When I first started, I loved it so much I was voluntarily coming in on my days off. Over just months the company's ""modernization"" has destroyed the working environment here with no regards for it's employees. The only way you'll get a promotion is by sucking up to management. Knew a woman who worked here 32 years with job responsibilities of a team lead and received no pay increase or promotion; While a girl who worked in softlines for 2 years was promoted to a Tech team lead with 0 experience in the department after hanging out with leads. If you have good work ethic, this place will work you until you physically collapse by doing the jobs of 4+ by yourself. When you first start, you'll get 40 hours a week regularly and then out of no where they'll cut you down to less than 10 but call and ask you to come in to do someone else's job. But don't worry! You get benefits if you work there 6 months (even if you don't want them, They're terrible anyway.) while your working less than 10 hrs a week, so hey! You're making even less! Awesome... If you're looking for spare cash, or a part time job, then you'll manage just fine. Other than than, if you have bills to pay ect, PLEASE go somewhere else. Majority of us couldn't even afford to buy ourselves lunch. Constantly understaffed, work environment is in disarray regularly and the place is dirty all the time, management is passive aggressive and unappreciative, bad pay with bad hours."
bad,"Constantly cutting hours and asking more from workers. Never enough time to get done what was needed. Heard that ""modernization"" has been awful for employees. Just another example of a huge cooperation abusing the lowest level of staff to turn a buck. Had higher ups visit the mess many times just to have them smile and say everything is great. This was while the backrooms were overflowing with backstock."
bad,"It is a good place to work if you are in school or have another job. Not a good job to support yourself."
bad,"Very bad management, harassing you constantly about your job , always watching you , accused people of false things that they do. Make you work a schedule that you can’t work with. Keeps employees that don’t do any work but fire all the good employees that were very hard workers. They stand around and did nothing but talk and made other people do there work."
bad,"I have worked here much longer than I expected.  A LOT has changed since I began, and not for the better.  Just typical retail now, where they are money hungry and the only people that receive decent hours are management, and so DO NOT expect to support your family if you work here.  This is a part-time job at best.  They do take advantage of you during the holidays though, and so you may have a few more hours during that time.  The way target is able to pay a 'decent' wage is because they slash everyone's hours, and so mostly people receive hours in the 20-something range a week."
bad,"Management was only giving out criticism, no matter how hard you worked it was never good enough. "
bad,13 dollars 13 hours  . Coach people well but they keep poor help because no one last long there can't afford to work there. They are unwilling to work with you . They want you to have open availability for 18 hrs a week. Did better with 2 jobs both offer benefits and work with you. Please save your time
bad,They have you doing the work of 10 people and if you don't get your work done by the end of the day you get scolded you get treated like a child......
bad,"I always maintained a good attitude, so I don't think most people realized I hated it. The management is pretty terrible because they are not willing to pay them a decent salary. They are terrible when it comes to keeping work machinery repaired or in good working order. It is ok, if you really want a temporary job, and you don't care how much your paid, but other than that, forget it."
bad,"Nothing to write"
bad,"You only get developed if you’re favorited. Hours are very inconsistent and unless you’re a TL or higher you’ll rarely hit 40 hours or be considered part time, UNLESS you’re favorited. Favoritism plays a big role. The amount of stress isn’t worth the pay or bad hours. Not a good full-time job unless you’re okay with 25 hours or under."
bad,"I used to get 32-40 weekly on an average basis. Till the CEO implemented the new ""Improved"" method of doing business in May 2019.  Now Team Members are lucky to get 10-20 hours a week.  They doubled the team member numbers for the store and cut every ones hours in half! New team members get paid the same as employees that are training them and have 10-30 years under their belt!!  There is no incentive to stay with Target and little respect from management.  Since May 2019 20% of our long term team members have found other jobs and  40% have started looking, or have taken a second job.  I do not recommend working for Target if you have a family to support of a mortgage to pay.   Medical Benefit is expensive with high deductibles. Dental is expensive and hard to find dentists in our area that accepts the insurance."
bad,"Worst Target store to work at. If you live in Chicago and you are considering applying to Target, avoid this location! Management is terrible, over half of the people who work there are terrible. The annual raises are a joke, 9/10 it gets taken back, and overall this location in particular has a very toxic environment. Trust me it's not worth it."
bad,It was every man for themselves work environment. The security team is more of a retail sales driven more than security driven. They treat you like you are a sales floor team member.
bad,I found the management lazy and greedy.  They ate lunch in the cafe verses the team member area. They took an extra long time in their offices and then came out with accusations that people were not working hard enough. They required pregnant women to push heavy loads of products. The middle management throws their team under the bus to save their own self. It's an atrocious there.
bad,"Plus, it’s such a huge game of politics. Your work contribution doesn’t matter, everyone throws everyone else under the bus to make themselves look better."
bad,I worked a year and a half. Its faced paced at times. But the company is only worried about the company not you. Your expendable. Not recommended  if u have a family or single parent.
bad,"Immature and unprofessional managers bring down an otherwise okay environment. Fast paced and wouldn't be so bad, but management is practically useless."
bad,Don't know about other stores but management and supervisors at the hanford store have no leadership skills and tell everyone to do things they have no knowledge of and should not be in leadership positions
bad,Target treats their workers terribly and don't care about them and are very racist. Managers may walk by your area and see that you need help but will walk away and act like they can’t help.
bad,"management ignored my availability and scheduled me all the time. Coworkers called in and I was forced in on my days off every week. Coworker bullied me and attempted to have me fired on my first day. Overall, disastrous management of a dumpster fire of a store. At least it paid decently."
bad,"Simple as that. If you plan on having a social life this is not the job for you, if you have other responsibilities and family to take care this is not the job for you. They say they'll work around school schedules but will still work you against your availability. This job is more for first timers or high school and college students that need a little extra coins in their pockets. If you're 30+, married, small children get ready to make a sacrifice or move your life around to accommodate working at target. The environment is toxic, everyone is fake and phony. Managers play favorites. If you're looking to make a few friends you will but everyone has an agenda or motive. Cant trust any  and everyone.  HR is super unorganized and unprofessional and on top of that have nasty attitudes to the point you dont even want to ask for help."
bad,Over the years it had a big downfall. 3 years ago they were flexible not anymore. Ive changed availablitly for times has not gotten accepted. Treat employees like 10 year olds. Will come up to you and complain to you after a callout. Managers have raised voices at employees. Do not treat their loyal hard working employees well. Hopefully this changes and maybe ill have something good to say
bad,"the back room of the location that i worked in was piled high with boxes blocking major isles, chemical spills, slippery debris all over the floor, heavy heavy pallets and boxes hanging over the edges of shelves. upper management didn’t care to do anything about it."
bad,"Management was horrific, all of the managers except for around 3 of them were good people. But the rest were horrible people with disgusting personalities to match, they over work you expect you to not make a fuss about it, talk down on you like if their not also human, threaten you with your job, expect you to do the work in other departments that get paid more but won’t pay you what they pay them, and just overall mistreat and under-appreciate their employees, target is the worst place to work."
bad,"Little to no training, expectations are insane, managers are entirely incompetent and lazy. Not worth the headache. Other retailers at least give a realistic expectation for what to expect, not here."
bad,"Awful place to work.  Saving money is the main focus regardless of how this affects staff."
bad,"Transferred from a low volume store to another, but this was 100x worse. "
bad,"Poor management, they always stay on my case about everything, they need to back off, I have been there almost 5 years. Team leaders are lazy. Unhappy"
bad,"I have worked at target for a little over a year. Management is terrible, they care about themselves and only themselves. I have actually caught them talking trash about other employees behind their backs including mine. The amount of time given to complete tasks is extremely unreasonable. I like to think I do my job and I do it well, but scheduling me a 4 hour shift and expecting me to get 25 things done at once? I have had stress caused anxiety attacks from working here and I have never had that at any other job. Lastly, my hours have went from 40 hours a week to 12 hours a week with out warning! Target looks pretty and fun when you just run in there to go shopping, but it’s an awful place to work."
bad,"I pretty much hated Target the entire time I worked there. There's really no advancing in your area. "
bad,"this place will work the life out of you.Im a hard working person and I don't complain , but this people are unfair here.  Mandatory overtime throughout most of the year, 12 nights every night. Management does not care about workers or their safety. only production and numbers. long hours. management shows unfair treatment to employees"
bad,"They have an everyone's replaceable attitude to their employees. "
bad,"Started in Nov. as a Logistics Team Member. Lasted until the end of Feb. During the holiday season, Nov.-Dec. they would let you get 40 hours, but overtime was only offered during 2 weeks of the season and they would always tell you at the end of the week, so there weren't many hours to accumulate. After the holiday season, the expectations were to work 5 days a week including Fridays and Saturdays, & sometimes Sundays and only 4-hour shifts were available. This resulted in being just as tired as working 40 hours a week but only getting $200/week after taxes. They force you to clock out for a 30 minute lunch. You're given two paid 15 minute breaks for an 8-hour shift, although they often want you to work through those."
bad,"I would never recommend working here. I've worked for 2 locations and both locations everyone was miserable. Management is terrible and rude. It's just a disorganized mess. I would be thrown in departments  IWasnt trained in. Yet when I wanted to train for a specific department I was told no, because I hadn't met the 90 day requirement."
bad,"I would never recommend anyone to work at the Target in Holland! The management at this store is ridiculous adding task after task, then making comments about the task not being done within a certain amount of time. They failed to realize while out on the floor the customers also need help. Near the end of my time working there I was getting these ridiculous hours, for example they would schedule me 10 hours for a WHOLE WEEK, but they would have me come in to work for four hours one day and three the next day. That company wasted my time. Something else that bothered me when I quit I never received my last check. I talked to other former employees they also said they never received their last check."
bad,"The real challenge of the new and current Target labor refocus strategy is that of placing high expectations and responsibilities on brand new hires immediately.  If you are a fast learner, can multitask like a champ and essentially know how to do everything before being trained how, you can succeed here.  These are common demands of competitive, professional and financially rewarding employment opportunities.  "
bad,"I applied here part-time (still was given full time hours) thinking it would be typical retail (task, customer service, etc). This place was the worst job I’ve had to date. One manager saw me not talk to a customer (who had been spoken too already by one of my coworkers) and from then on she hounded me about talking to every customer (not calling them guest). She then had other managers participate in harassing me to talk more to customers about their personal life, even though I had my own task to do. Talked to other employees & apparently no one liked having be fake & converse with every single customer...glad to be leaving this job soon, not worth the stress for the little extra amount of money they pay you. On top of that in style you have 3 whole sections to yourself, sometimes more & they expect you to be done by closing. I see why they have a high turnover. Managers gossip & also do everything but help you complete task to leave on time."
bad,"Target used to be a decent place to work. You used to get a usual set amount of hours a week. The work wasn't too difficult and management was fairly easy going. THAT HAS ALL CHANGED! New managers have been brought in to replace the old ones that were earning higher pay. They will schedule you either 5 hours a week or 39.5, no in between. If you are dedicated and go above what is required, they will work you to the bone without any thanks. If you don't they will give you one day a week and shame you. They will cut all departments to one to two workers each day with 4-hour shifts but when someone important is coming to visit the store they will schedule you a 9-hour shift and beg you to stay later. You are treated like livestock, not people. Absolutely no promotion from within. Over half of the employees that were with the company in January 2019 have already left or are planning to. The people that stay only stay because they like their fellow coworkers and don't want to let them down. The only good things about working at Target are the sick/vacation days. They do pay more than the average retail job and are going to go to $15 next year but its hardly worth it. Target stores in other areas might be different but I would steer clear of Target Mays Landing."
bad,"Random weeks with 40 hours, random weeks with no hours. Minimum wage, they promised our team an increase but went back on it months later. Promised things often seem to be taken back there. Managers overwork cart attendants and ignore any messages to try and explain to them how they cant get their job done because of all that's been added onto them. High turnover rate."
bad,"No opportunity for growth. Regardless of how good of a job you do it is not appreciated  or good enough."
bad,"Target says it’s fast, fun,and friendly, that’s a joke it’s fast paced alright you get set times in your assigned departments to get your work done and if you don’t complete  it by that time  you get written up after so many times.Hours that your scheduled to work are horrible,usually  only scheduled 3 to 4 hours.Teams are always understaffed putting pressure on the few people that do show up to work.Poor management don’t know how to manage teams or communicate to things to their team members.Only good thing about working there was meeting new people all the time."
bad,"Working for Target can be fun as long as you allow management to run your life to the ground. They promote You to other departments if you wish, noting that as soon a you demonstrate great skills they will give you assignments impossible to achieve by yourself in record time. My experience was no a pleasant once as I had a supervisor Who’s way of encouragement was to always threading my employment with write ups if a task wasn’t completed in Her estimated time frame, which most of the time was impossible. Her idea of the perfect work environment included micromanagement with daily suggestions that I should skip breaks altogether in order to achieve these tasks in order to prevent a possible write up. Couldn’t even take bathrooms breaks without being called on the walk-in talkie by this same supervisor requesting my location, I couldn’t be assisting customers because I was literally dragged away from them to do something unrelated to my tasks.  This particular manager did not respected  LGBTQ people and was always making sure Her religion an believes were being pushed to the extreme."
bad,"My target store is horrible! The managers never have the same standards, up front at the check lanes the managers change stuff every day, so we never know if were doing something right or not. People who have been working there for years are not getting more then 19 hours a week, when they used to make 38 or 39 hours a week. That happening under new management. The managers don't stand behind there staff when it comes to guest and policy's. The managers get very rude even though they are higher up. I could go on, and on about why I hate working at target but that's just a couple of the main reasons I am trying to find a new job now. I will say, not every single manager there is exactly this bad but I will say that they never hold the same standards when closing or opening with there counterparts. Every single manager has a different routine and its confusing for the rest of the staff."
bad,"Target is a fast paced very intense job.  They strive for safety but push you to achieve a goal that is sometimes impossible, due to the freight you are packing.  Target takes three years for your pay to top out yet they expect you to go the pace of people who have been there way longer than you.  Walmart distribution pays their employees the same throughout the warehouse.  Target pays packers less than everyone else yet their jobs are  just as hard if not harder.  Also during peak season which is Thanksgiving/Christmas.  They work you 58 hours a week Mandatory.  No Family time."
bad,"It is an extremely stressful job because it requires the worker to do many functions at once and the salary is the worst. Is unsafe place to work. "
bad,"While I was a part time employee at Target, I was balancing another job alongside to even out my income. While working at Target, I made some great connections with fellow coworkers and guests that would come into the store. However, the store management was an absolute joke! They were constantly scheduling me outside of my availability was was conflicting with my other job, I was always getting told about my ""attendance"" from one of the LOD's, and they expected a lot of out you for little pay an hour."
bad,"I worked as a Beauty Team Member for around four months when I finally had to quit. They claim to be flexible with scheduling, but they're always asking you to pick up shifts, even if they're on days that you are supposed to have off. If you don't take the shifts (even if you have an unavoidable conflict, like school) they take that as being unreliable and not caring about your job. Especially as a Beauty Team Member at my location, extreme amounts of work were placed on very few Team Members, and then we were reprimanded for not finishing. Some of the backroom at my location was not up to fire code, especially during the holidays, which really shows how much they care about employee wellbeing. My location only fixed it when they knew a visit from corporate was about to happen. Overall, a really horrible, awful place to work. The only upside was that as a Beauty Team Member I was paid 50 cents more than minimum wage."
bad,Target Distribution in Midway Ga is the worst company to work for. They definitely don’t care about any of there employees when you get hurt on there time they are a bunch of slave driving people with no experience in anything if you read this stay away the money isn’t that great for the bs you deal with you are maxed out in 2 years hope you don’t work there for 20 years good luck. The only good thing about it is the name Target.They definitely show favoritism Junky equipment
bad,"As summary said, it was a fast paced environment with no support from managers. Regardless of team efficiency, employers never satisfied. Hours were insane, often expected to work the late evening shift one day, and the early morning shift the next. This only afforded you ~4-5 hours of sleep with zero time to eat. Speaking against this practice resulted in cut hours."
bad,"It used to be a great place to work, however a lot of things changed and they seemed to stop caring about the employees. Not flexible with scheduling and they dont care about a work life balance."
bad,"Not going to work here long. You only get benefits when you are there for a year, managers and team leads only care about your schedule needs as long as it fits their needs, constant rude comments. I got injured on the job and when my limitations went below what they were willing to accommodate, they asked me to quit. Forced to work days when used to overnight schedule because of injury and threatened with no hours if I didn't switch to days."
bad,"I got an interview and I got the job on that day. I was told I had to wait till my background check came back so 3-5 days. So I called back about 4 days later asking about an orientation date. They told me that the manager was out that day and that they’d ask when they got back. So I called 2 days later and asked again about orientation, her response was “oh I’m looking for something next week”. So the next week comes and no phone calls from them AGAIN! Let me remind you that this has been 3 weeks since my interview. So I called one last time on a Friday and asked again about orientation. The woman said that they were looking for something on a Monday and I asked if they would call me back about a time and she of course said “I’ll call you before I leave today!” Well the whole weekend went by and the day came for “orientation” and still nothing. I’m not sure if it usually takes this long for people to start there but this is absolutely terrible customer service. It is now 4 weeks since my interview and still nothing back."
bad,"This store will honestly be closed very soon. The Store Leader is the worst woman alive. She has absolutely no idea how to lead a store. She walks around very entitled with her nose in the air and will not speak to you until she needs you to do something for her. She’s beyond miserable and it’s quite the shame to be in such a position and instead of inspiring her team to want to do better and one day be in her position, she makes them want to quit and hate the company from her horrible attitude. Then her negativity spreads right down to her assistant leaders . They all have the potential of being great people but nothing’s ever good enough for her there for she makes their lives as miserable as hers and they take their frustrations out on the team members and then wonder why they can’t get team members to work at their full potential. It’s not healthy working at this location at all. When becoming a new team member in any department you’ll get maybe two four hour training shifts where you are then left alone to operate your department, so in the end you won’t know anything and will make everyone else’s job more difficult. There’s no way to be successful here. You’ll get a max of 30 hours a week if you’re lucky and if you’re disliked by the leadership team look at around 15-20hrs. Anyone who wants to advance in the company will only get lied to and nothing will ever come of it. I worked for this store for 4 years and it was once an amazing place to work and feet like one big family, and unfortunately terrible leadership has caused tons of loyal team members to resign and the"
bad,"I learn how to under value and unappreciated my life, where is the love and humbleness of this county, have a nice day.  wdoabwd;jbakdnpaosjdopa'[pdkls][p"
bad,They want you to pull zone push the product update they might have five of work and they may give you 6 in half a hour to work that do not include waiting on guests and helping at as a back up cashier to much work they will lose a lot of workers plus not enough hour only 15 hours a week
bad,Target was a good experience at first. After 11 years it went down hill. I was in maintenance at the distribution center. No parts. People with zero maintenance experience in charge of maintenance. My job never felt secure. Always changing at target not always for the best. “Canada” contract maintenance at the food distribution centers like lake city Florida and Denton Texas. I seen the changes coming down the line and thought why am I here. It’s time to move on so I did.
bad,"When I first started at target there was team work and care. Now it’s every man for themselves, do everyone’s job for base pay, rude management, and just flat out no care for anyone. My time at target has severely changed and declined since the beginning making everyday that I went to work I wanted to quit. In December one of the most stressful months of the year where hour increases are expected, they completely cut all of our hours.  Even though our sales were doing great."
bad,"Poor management, they tell you your doing good but the computer says your not therefore the computer is right. You are just a number here, they don’t care about you!"
bad,"The GSA’s fail to keep the front end supplies filled. Cashiers can’t get to them because they are locked up. Also when you put on your light for help the GSA is either at the service desk helping out because not enough people were scheduled, or they are in the back at the HR desk hanging out. They hire from the outside, although Team Members applied for the same jobs, and were told they passed their interview. I see a lot of good employees who were passionate about their jobs, just start to not care anymore. It’s really sad. Getting raises last year certainly helped."
bad,"Working at Target was a bad experience from start to finish. The hours are inconsistent, Corporate is constantly changing rules and demands to make productivity even harder. They'll schedule you for a certain amount of time to work and if you leave at your scheduled time they punish you for it by taking away hours on your next schedule. They constantly take advantage of the workers and you will not feel appreciated working here."
bad,Target could be a great place to work due to the people but when it comes to going to HR for help and that you have so many concerns they will most likely push that to aside and just tell you that they can’t do anything about it. It frustrates me the most when I can’t seem to get the help that I needed to be able to feel comfortable and like my job. I would highly not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,The worst place to work at is target a  racist company  Specially the one in  Lancaster pa.  Management sucks   Good advice don’t apply there.  Target will accused you of taking a longer break but we all know it’s a lie.  If you call corporate nothing will be done so at the end the day you were Screwed
bad,"It wasn't anything special, I wasn't being abused horribly or anything, but it was difficult to do my job with such spotty training. They also fire their seasonal hires before their time is done. My brother was fired for being late when he was only late because the door had to be unlocked at 5AM, someone else was fired for walking too slow...just...really bad company like any other place, but I wasn't treated like a complete slave."
bad,"Managers were very lazy left all the work on the other workers, when they dislike another person the manager would be very spiteful to them. They don't listen to your complaint and HR is the worst."
bad,highly would recommend not working at target...management sucks. they pick and choose favorites and ridicule the one who come up short. they also handle the store and stressful situations terribly they suck with there scheduling and you can never get the time of you want...would not recommend.
bad,"The most value a company can have is integrity. As the years went by that begin to decline at the Target. Management became disconnected with leaders, team members, and guest. From reprimanding  employees for taking action to fascilitate connection with guest in front of multiple persons. To undermining leaders authority in front of team members.  These types of moves that created dishonesty and tension throughout the store."
bad,they night starts off with working on the line stacking everything on U boats and lifting large boxes of chemicals over your head to put on the top shelf of the U boat the work place is fast paste you need to keep your fast paste through the whole night and ever slow down.
bad,"They say they give raises but will screw you any chance they get. Took a position with more responsibility and everyone before me got a raise and HR said I would get the back pay on the raise, lo and behold 3-4 months of doing said position they tell me its a zero cent raise...."
bad,not a good place to work if you are looking for something serious and stable they are always hiring new people and firing other to pay less and not give benefits no sick day in the first year and vacation time ether.
bad,"Team culture and people are great, upper management not great. Work life balance and pay are not worth it. Long exhausting hours during seasonal. No growth or development"
bad,"Favoritism, terrible management. Being singled out. One sided stories. No room for advancement. Hr department does nothing about employee complaints don't apply!."
bad,Working at target was very relaxed and chill but you will never get hours and once their done with you for seasonal they will fire anyone in a heartbeat especially cashiers!!
bad,"Although I enjoyed working with a select few employees the ""Team Lead"" i had to deal with was a NIGHTMARE! She acted as if she was better then everyone else although I learned she has only been a lead for about a month or 2 longer then I had been there. I honestly don't give 2 sh**s that she was pregnant that is NO excuse for treating her employees the way she was. I over heard her talking to another, few, employees about how if we weren't good enough we would hear her mouth and the Good employees wouldn't. And that she would ""Just blame the baby"" for her attitude. Well guess I wasn't good enough cause she was on my a** the entire night to the point I quit! I was there for almost 2 months with NO complaint until that night (I haven't worked a full shift with her in a few weeks) and all I got was call after call on our walkies about how I needed to do this and that and that I should've been done an hour ago blah blah....Seriously I am only 1 person and doing my absolute best, like I had been for weeks prior! This job was so NOT worth the stress for the very LITTLE pay!! and when I told HR/Management the night I quit...HA not one word of encouragement for me to stay, even though they made it seem they didn't want me to leave. All they said was ""are you sure, well we just need you to resign on the website"" So apparently they are OK with everything she said and did to me and to all the other new employees, cause from what I heard I'm NOT the only one....Even when picking up my final check the next day my ""manager"" walked past me and said ""Hi___, take care"" that's IT! no what happened,"
bad,Management does not hire enough hands for the work. So this caused a very stressful work place among current workers. It was nice to have 40 hrs a week for a part time job but the job was never done when you left.
bad,"The hours were not consistent. Hour cuts became a normal thing near the end of my employment. We went through three store managers and around four lead managers in the span of a couple months. This lead to bad organization, stressful work environment, and bad team morale."
bad,My shift worked at Target was changed from 4am to 6:30 am and there is no chance at all to change shift to evening shift.  My hourly rate reduced from 20 hours to less than 12 hours and it happened to many of co-workers.
bad,"If your looking for advancement in a company this would not be the place, typically you would have to put in years to the company to be considered, and this is not a company to support a family on."
bad,If I had the chance at a different job plus keep the small number of hours I have a target I would end up having to work both jobs just to afford to live.
bad,"I transferred from a place that paid really well to a new state that the pay was lower and got to keep the higher pay. The problem was that when I eventually got bumped up to a lead, they refused to up my pay because I maid more than my lead. More work with same pay; never again."
bad,"Workload felt overbearing, left hours after scheduled timing, felt extremely understaffed. Did offer lots of on the job training, as well as technology/equipment/updated systems to help make the job easier."
bad,Senior management team does not pay attention to the needs of their middle management team.  Sr management team only cares to cover their behinds and will let all fall onto the sword just to have a finger pointed at a team member.
bad,"The management was terrible and it was stressful. The hardest part was being made do all the dirty work, the fellow employees wouldn't work as a team."
bad,"The management was always changing (3 GMs, 4 HR, 10 or more floor managers) and that's in less than 2 years. You constantly have to worry about changing your work. There is no security or loyalty from management. Management bias is apparent. The dress code is nice and simple. The majority of the work staff is great minus the management. Your great work and attendance is not taken into consideration unless you are in the favorite graces of management. The more work you do (service deck, casher, café, sales floor, stocking shelves) gets you no consideration for advancement only if the management likes you as a friend not just because you make the customers, staff and store a better over all place to be. I like the staff of cashiers in general and really enjoyed working with the customers or guests."
bad,"Don't work here if you are looking for advancement. Over worked, under staffed and under paid. Got a $0.20 raise. It was insulting and affected the work culture. Team leaders are lazy and ride other employees to do their jobs."
bad,"You are constantly under pressure and scrutiny to get job done with often unrealistic time frames. Target has a young culture, prefer to advance younger employees. Very poor and inconsistent training. Prefers to hire new employees that were trained elsewhere than to give you a chance. I would say, okay for a part-time job, if you have no expectations for advancement or hours.  Always fun to help guests that appreciate your diligence. As in all jobs, a lot depends on your team leaders. Mine were immature and would prank call the store, even the store director!"
bad,New manager. Everyone was unhappy. No way to report manager infractions. Everyone was constantly talked down to like we were children. Micromanagement. Any engagement with the store ETL was always negative. Poor communication. Promise of consistent scheduling with no follow through. Even the PB+J promised in the break room is never there. New ETL cuts your breaks (1x 15 min break for 8+ hrs of work). Very unprofessional management team.
bad,"Was okay to work for, Paid well for the overnight shift. Had bad communication and unrealistic expectations. They don't work well with your schedule or when events out of you control take priority over work. Management Guilt trips you into working when you are sick."
bad,The Target in Copiague is such a high turn rate job where managers are open with telling you they are searching for any little thing to fire people to get newer people with basic salary until they have been there a year and get the mandatory raise which then they will be on the chopping block as well
bad,"Use to be a great place to work and I was proud to be an employee.  New leadership came in and got rid of a bunch of top talent, brought their own leaders in and the company went downhill from there.  I would discourage anyone from going there."
bad,"They treat the employees as slaves, they are racist and what impressed me, is that they are people without education, badly spoken and without manners."
bad,I m not happy work with target because too much change hour and up then hour down bec i spend work as long 12 yeats ...and i work hard to line for unloaded truck everytime morning start 4 am to depend how many account are boxes inside truck ...
bad,"Did not like the management, was a stressful work place. no one worked as a team. no one was happy or motivated to work. management was not good and used you to there advantage."
bad,"Having target as my first job was a mistake I thought it would be so much fun working at the place I love to shop. I was wrong, the people I worked with would talk bad about each other and everyone we worked with."
bad,they expect you to do a lot of minimum wage. people are very unprofessional there. not everyone is very organized so if one person messes up your whole team gets rap for it.
bad,"They're awful bosses. They would yell at you for the smallest things, they would ask you to do up to 20 different things in one hour and would be irate if you couldn't finish 3 carts full of re-shop and so on."
bad,The flow team Management was terrible. They also made me feel like I hated my life. They always pressured you stay late and come in on your days off. They singled people out and picked on them till they couldn't take it anymore and quit.
bad,The management styles are demeaning and belittling. The scheduling is crazy Hours drastically change from week to week as do hours. They pay better than most places but they then take that out on you and treat you badly
bad,I met some good people working for target. Management slacked on their own work but harassed others to be on top of their job. I barely got hours. They didn’t want to give nobody 40 hours even though they needed at least 40 hours for health insurance.
bad,"Temporary. Seasonal a way to earn extra money. Started as a cashier but they had me working all over the store in all departments. Working in shoes, jewelry, health and beauty, stocking"
bad,Lacking in communication from teammate to teammate and to supervisors. Lack of proper training and providing information to carry out job requirements
bad,"I don't know if it's this store location I am at, but there is so much pressure for one person to do the work of 3. The managers are always sitting in their offices and taking it easy while the workers are scrambling to get their work done before it's time to clock out."
bad,"No training at this job.You were supposed to get 4 weeks, and we barely got 2. Their production requirements were impossible to meet. Management had no idea how to do the job that they were telling you to do."
bad,"have to empty truck, put out all freight, most of the time with minimal employees. only went up about $2.00 in 11 years. not a very good place to work."
bad,"Working at Target started off nice, and then workers and management started to show their true colors. A lot of management cut corners and falsified work schedules to make themselves look as though they were maintaining a certain number of staffing at all times. They lied and deceived district managers, they used bullying tactics to put fear in their worker's hearts about possibly losing their positions due to any reason, and they hired on friends and family even if they did not meet the required qualifications. Target has a high employee turnover rate for this reason. They yelled at employees for changing their availability and would not work with them to meet their lifestyle needs."
bad,"A typical day at work for me as a packer was in a mod for 11 hours a day.  We are only allowed 2 breaks a day within the 12 hour work week.   I was given the opportunity to work in our dispatch/logistics office, and in doing so I was able to learn how to work with different personalities. "
bad,"Poor management,  very inconsistent management & rules. Team leads are a joke! Nobody is held responsible for anything. Very unorganized.  Wouldn't every recommend anyone to work there."
bad,You are bounced around the store like you are some kind of monkey.  Management shows no interest in anything going wrong in your personal life that could effect your work.  I worked there for  a short period of time and was fired after being in the hospital for 4 days and returning to work with a doctors note for my time off and they were also aware that I was out in the hospital.   There was nothing enjoyable about this job besides a starbucks being a few feet away.
bad,"A day at work would normally consist of attempting to do the work that was required of you, until management felt your time was better used towards tasks that they should have been doing. I learned that management in retail tend to think more for themselves rather than the whole store. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I actually got to the job I was required to do."
bad,"Not enough hours. If I am a full-time worker I should get full-time hours.Management needs sensitivity training, very rude. Not enough diversity in management."
bad,Very stressful work environment. It was not a friendly place to work. There is no job security. you are rated based of how many product a night you picked. The supervisors were incompetents
bad,"The target i worked at was horrible and I see why it shut down. The management was horrible. anything i did learn i taught myself. we did  not get any hours, they showed favoritism."
bad,"I have worked as a customer service supervisor. I have also been a third key at another retailer. I just started working at my nearby target as a seasonal. They hired me as a cashier and I was perfect with that since I just needed some extra cash and was bored at home. This place is TERRIBLE. Everybody working their for more than 2-3 months thinks he is the boss of the store. I have worked at places where they never let you make the other person feel like you are above them. The ""supervisors"" on the front end have favorites and grind the newcomers the most or the ones they aren't ""friends"" with. They want you to do 10 things at a time. Everybody is fake. If you start working at Peterson Chicago target. Please dont be nice to anybody or friendly, they will talk about you behind you, tell on you, lie about you. All petty kids. I have never hated working somewhere so much. I just need a lil more money and I'll be out in a week. So much unprofessionalism, so much favoritism. Even the store managers have favorites. They need to do anonymous questions and answers and they'll find out how many people hate the management and the way things are done. I am sure not all the target are same. But this one was horrible."
bad,this place is not a great place to work. management doesn't respect employees. I did not enjoy my time worked here. They had gooD benefits. I will not miss this place
bad,"Management only cares about redcard numbers, not if you have many mouths to feed.Very stressful, if you don't sell redcards you don't get hours. they also threaten to fire employees who don't get a specific nuber of redcards every shift."
bad,"You do not want to work at Target in Hanover, Ma! The associates all hAd attitudes. The managements was horrible! This was by far the worse place I have worked at. Your on your feet for 7 1/2 hours."
bad,"Poorly run co. Speaks for itself, review how many ceos target had "
bad,"I would really rather not say what my opinion of the current management of my Target store is due to not trusting the store team lead's judgement.  My executive team leads are fine, however."
bad,Target is all about profit. Very little real care goes towards its hourly staff. As a manager we are tasked with trying to explain why we cut everyones hours in February. (Its to lower hourly staff avg hours worked to below 30 per week. )
bad,We always had 4 hours to unload a full truck and stock said truck. The team members were a friendly bunch. The management needed a little help in their communication when hiring someone.
bad,"Managers refuse to pay workers fair hours so that they have more payroll for themselves, unsafe job practices involving forcing any employee, trained or not, cleaning up bio-hazard spills, ignoring harassment allegations from multiple employees about a team lead, locking workers in at night and setting the alarm so that we could not leave unless told to do so, only for location T-1382 (New Tampa location)."
bad,Management including HR treats you as trash. Co workers are great people. We love to laugh and share international food during lunch our. You wiil get fired if you don't follow scheduled lunch break.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working here. The work environment is full of micromanagement and passive aggressive team leaders. I digress the pay is ok for the most part.
bad,Cashier manager was very poor had his favorites and all management basically stuck together and agreed upon everything. Most enjoyed assisting my customers and working with certain co-workers whom were friendly and helpful.
bad,"If you're looking for a job where you feel undermined, underpaid, under appreciated, and would like for management to treat you like you don't matter, Target is the place for you."
bad,The only good thing that comes out of working at target is the experience. Other than that everything about that job puts a lot of stress on you. Management is poor and pay is terrible.
bad,"Too much favoritism and too much negativity at the target that I used to work at. There's about one supervisor that is welcoming. The management is super unprofessional. Felt like a slave working there. There's no type of communication within higher management and employees and they make accusations with no proof to get you fired, I know a few people who got accused of the same things and got fired for it and they do not provide proof."
bad,Management is TERRIBLE. The team members are great to work with but the managers are awful. Wasted 5 years working here.  When you have a problem managers never fix the issue and do not even talk to you about it instead they ignore the problem. STAY AWAY from this horrible company!!
bad,"For big box retail, Target is one of the most friendly and efficient stores I have ever worked for but it suffers from the same pitfalls. With several mangers on duty at any given time it is difficult to acquire about what your daily tasks are coming onto your shift and with other employees not completing their tasks it forces you to do the work of two people."
bad,"it was a fun and friendly work place know its not."
bad,Just recently I applied at Target because I was looking for a job. And I knew that Target was a good company. So I decided to give Target another shot.I appiled for a cashier position. So soon after that they sent me an email saying that weren't any job openings at this time. Witch I didn't believe because I saw that were on Indeed. Com. So yesterday I received a call from Target for a job. I told the lady on the phone. That Target sent me an email saying that there weren't any job openings. To me she sounded very comfused.
bad,"Target itself is a great company to work for. However, at my location, management was busy with gossip, favoritism, and playing high school drama that they forgot they were ETLs. The worst part is probably the bullying and favoritism. Team members, however, were mostly awesome and humble. "
bad,"i was there for over three years and never received compensation for the hard work i performed. No medical benefits because they kept me just under the required amount of hours needed to receive benefits. noone above the age of 35 was in upper management. people that trained with my same work ethic were promoted right around me. note, they were all under the age of 25."
bad,teams are really large and no one that I worked with was really sociable in any type of way. Most of my coworkers couldn't even really speak proper english so the language barrier was real.
bad,Okay company to work for if you don't have a life. 12 hour shifts every weekend isn't worth it. They don't tell you the stress of meeting 💯 sorting and loading trucks every night non-stop. If numbers not meet you can loose your job.
bad,"I was on the pricing team, they bullied me out of there within the first 90 days, saying I was doing things I was not doing while I was working like a dog for them.  there is no appreciation.  no reward.  they will bring you into rooms and talk to you alone then bully you."
bad,Target does not care about their workers. They often cut hours and never want to work with your schedule. The managers barely know how to do their jobs and they treat their  employees like the lowest of the low. If you end up working part time you barely get any benifits and dont qualify for many of heir workers programs. If you show them that you are a great worker they abuse your work ethic but still give you a horrible raise. You never take you breaks when you are suppose to and they are most likely cut short which is against the law. . If you tell you get fired and replaced and you get penalized if you dont stay past your shift and leave at your scheduled time.
bad,"I was hired for the Food Avenue department of Target, & was excited to work for the company. I trained for a little over a week , by the third week I was on my own, people called out , leaving me alone for the rest of the day. We were also severely understaffed , so one person working 7-2pm , then the other 2-9:30pm. They never mentioned these circumstances during my interview. Hands down , this was the worst job I've ever had. Target gave me anxiety attacks, & I broke down multiple occasions during my shifts. Never got my breaks. Quit after 3 months. They loved to play favorites , so there was no opportunity for me to advance, nor did they like me because I was the only to question their management."
bad,Management is completely lost and has no clear plan for anything. Management is rude and incapable of managing anything. The company tries to do a lot with very minimal workers scheduled. Management is completely out of touch with what is needed to be successful. Management acts oblivious to the concerns of the employees.
bad,"First job out of college. They promised me that I would promoted to Assistant Manager with 60 days. I worked hard, followed directions promptly and was always on time. When I brought up the promotion after 40 days, they gave me specific instructions on what to do and I did them. When I accomplished those things, they said that they weren't looking for an assistant manager anymore. 10 days later they had a new assistant manager. When I asked them about it, they didn't give me an answer. After that, I decided to quit."
bad,"Target is the worst place to be working at. No matter how hard you work and show so much effort, they will pick and choose favorites. No one is treated equally. Its pure abuse. Do 10x the work for little pay. LODs disrespecting EVERYONE on the job. Will threaten your job. They will force so much on you. Management is do terrible.They don't know how to work with the target team members. They create so much Drama. Pretend to be nice then back stab you. Never work for a target !! They'll never appreciate your hard work and commitment."
bad,This was my first real job and I was enjoying it for a couple weeks. If you haven't been there for a long time then they treat you without much respect. Another fact is that the managers all show favoritism they literally fired me for nothing after about 2 months. I thought it would be a breeze working here but I guess it all depends on the people you work with.
bad,"Not enough equipment"
bad,Target was not a very good place to work.Pay was very low.Managers were hard to work for.Couldnt go home until whole store was organized.No matter what time it was.
bad,"I like shopping at Target, but I would never work there again.  To much politics and favoritism.  I worked harder and longer than most, but was still let go."
bad,"Target is closed down and no longer a job option for anyone living in Canada. More of a high school job position, management was young and not a lot of training was given."
bad,The workers and customers were rude and they did not understand very well when it comes to family. I couldn't get the hours I needed and the pay rate was good enough when it came to the rude customers
bad,"The flow team supervisors are extremely rude and don't have compassion at all. They don't care if you have something personal going on in your life, they want you to work like a dog while they do nothing. This would have to have been my worse place of employment to date. I would never apply at another Target if I can help it."
bad,Management team does not take care of the store. Most areas are a mess. Security is horrible as well. Items are being stolen almost daily. You never get to take your 15 min breaks. Only good thing i would say is that they make sure you take you lunch break by your fifth hour.
bad,"typical day would be cashing out customers and making sure they had a good time in the store. I learned retail may not be for me, the management was very bad, they were very unorganized and didn't care about what the employees wanted. Culturally diverse, hardest part of the job would have to be putting up with the customers all day with a smile on my face, most enjoyable part of the job would be the people I work with that have turned into friends."
bad,"No communication"
bad,it was just another job a lot of bad people on drugs bad group leaders always on you about numbers even when ur above 85 percents basically its a game of who likes who best that's how you move up there harassed daily
bad,"Target is a very biased, Politically Correct, Liberal company which subjects it's Team Members to Psychological Conditioning and Slave Labor. I had several Team Members defame my character by starting lies, rumours, and such, and even Corporate HR swept it under the rug. The Executive Manager, Linda R. is absolutely corrupt. Target (as a whole) is corrupt I know that jobs can often be difficult to come by, but if you can avoid working for Target, I suggest just that."
bad,"Target does not care about any of its employees. The technology used is severely out dated by well over a decade and the way they handle themselves for scheduling an employee is laughable. There was multiple occasions where I would check my schedule on a Sunday, and go in on Monday and my schedule be completely different. To the extreme that I was no longer scheduled to work that Monday. "
bad,"Not too bad of a place to work. Management was not the best. They barely remembered anyone's name, and defiantly played favorites. Co-workers were very rude, and overall I didn't care for the company."
bad,"management was borderline tyrannical. very little concern for workers safety or getting the job done correctly. they insisted on all of these new systems and strategy to ""get the job done properly"" but they did nothing but gum up the works and make us almost never pack out the store before opening. a definite case of the wrong people in power who have no idea what there doing. i can count several times where i was very ill and was refused to leave early. even though i was throwing up and had a fever by people who believed protocol was better then acctually doing the job right and doing what logically had to be done. my breaks were often cut. and the pay was really poor for the work we were doing."
bad,"I had worked Target about 7 years. It was fun to work there at fist then everything changed.  I never had an advancement while working there.  I worked hard to get noticed by management and doing extra projects, but that never worked. I was glad to leave Target, because I was able to get a better job and pay."
bad,Have to kiss up to upper management  in order to be a team member there if you start as seasonal. Your pretty much on your own after 4 hours of training on your first day.  Customers will take advantage of new people so beware and management is never really around when it does happen
bad,"The typical day was boring and filled with people fumbling around because there was almost no communication. I only learned one skill which was biting my tongue so as not to argue with the horrendous management staff. The management was horrible. They were lacking in professionalism, blamed people without any real facts, had unrealistic expectations, and were totally disconnected from there staff. My co-workers were fine for the most part, some were great people whom I still keep in touch with, however many were awful people and workers. I can recount many times were a person would make vile comments in front of the guests. They would do almost no work and made life harder on those of us who did do our work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the staff and the generally rude guests. The most enjoyable part of my job was the punch code I had to type as I was leaving for the night"
bad,Almost everyone in management are unfair and show no respect to employees. Advancement comes only by how much management likes you. It's not based on your work or experience. There is a lot of he say she say at the Rock Hill store and others will believe it whether it's based on fact or opinion. It used to be a fun place to work and almost everyone got along but with the new management people only seem to be looking out for themselves and turning on each other just to get ahead. It's sad.
bad,It was extremely hard work which wasn't bad but the work didn't equal the compensation.  They expect too much for very little pay.  Everything has a time limit.  The morning crew seems unhappy.
bad,Though I had a lot of great coworkers that became fast friends from working there. Very little good to say about the actual employment there in general.
bad,"This place is beyond pathetic. 4 hours in an interview and 7 hours in orientation and my job was already threatened over 100 times. "
bad,"Good place to work if you like working every single weekend. And when you want a weekend off they get mad at you and sometimes turn you down. Management is just cruel and not supportive at all, and expect you to get a ton of red cards and when you don't they get mad. Horrible place to work. I would not even apply."
bad,"The management was terrible, the managers at Riverdale and layton in utah are stuck up and always talked bad about customers in front of them. While training they never tell you an exact time to come in then they get mad at you. The manager will talk bad about her employees behind your back. Its literally like a high school drama cliche. Not worth working there. Do not reccomend being a customer either."
bad,Not really a stable enviorment to work at hours are not stable and GSA tell everybody they can see the person grow within the company but they tell everybody the same story
bad,"I was an HR team member. They were falsifying documents, the ETL's never worked, they just sat on their butts and ate all day (which is why most of them are fat!). They only gave positive feedback to each other and TL's, never to Team members unless we were having a store visit. They are better at complaining and faking results for corporate than actually doing their job."
bad,"OF course u gonna b happy to land a job.if you don't have one.n the beginning,everything was kool.the operational mangers.were.kool everyone smiling in your face.making u think that youre doning a good job n so forth.but youre not every two weeks that have was called new hire orientation.n then they get rid of you once they got the work they wanted out of u.soo now youre out the door n all their focu.is on the new hires.no one make it pass their ninety days probation.period.they fired u.b4.your probation.n then they make up a reason why they letting u go.bad place to work.you hired to work 10 hours.but then they want you to work twelve hours shift.on a last min noticed."
bad,"This company runs on a bare minimum staff.  It is highly stressful if you are in any kind of management role.  There are unrealistic expectations of getting your work done.  They do not promote very often from within the company, even if you work there through college and try to apply for an Executive position.  I received my college degree while working there, but I could not apply for Executive level because I hadn't been a Sr. Team Leader yet, but they hire college graduates directly into the Executive role WITHOUT any experience within the company at all.  That is extremely backwards to me.  When I first started several years ago, they were fine.  Now, they have cut employees and hours so badly that the amount of work they expect you to do is a joke.  They don't care about their employees.  Don't waste your time."
bad,Hours fluctuate. Pay is unfair considering the management over doubled my workload over the course of me working their with small raises. Management is careless towards their employees. There is no reward for job performance or seniority.
bad,"Consistently over worked and under worked. Some days we can get scheduled 6 days straight and others we'll have 4-5 days off, all while being paid minimum wage. The schedules aren't flexible at all. If we have an emergency it's out problem to deal with, and if we don't show up they'll penalize us regardless of how serious our problem was. And if we want to move on to a different department? good luck. no matter how hard you work, they try to keep you in the same area."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was trying to find an item in the store while trying to help a customer check out at the same time, without assistance from other employees."
bad,"terrible, if your a cashier you will go insane making your ask every customer to get credit card management is not good, they will pock you to get credit card everyday none stop."
bad,"Management is constantly changing, and only cares about the store. The employees don't matter at all! Promotions within the company are rarely seen. Compensation is lousy, and not worth the high levels of stress that you go through everyday."
bad,Target has gone down hill since i started working there.  Young brow nosers get advancement by laughing and buddying with etl and they haven't been there a year.  People that work hard are treated badly and taken advantage of.  Store looks like absolute garbage til they get wind of a visit. Working environment is just terrible.
bad,the people who work hard are treated like dirt.    well the ones that do  nothing but stand around and talk and do a lousy job get promoted
bad,Wouldn't refer my worst enemy. Awful hours. No set schedule. Unrealistic work expectations. No constructive criticism between leads and seasonal employees.
bad,They play God with the lives of the leaders who deliver the results. HQ will not support the rules that are in place to protect the workers.
bad,Target is not the best job especially if you're a part time worker on the flow team. There are no health benefits besides dental. The schedule is very early morning shifts and can be switched depending on the season. There is no room for advancement and raises are very small. It takes a really long time to build vacation hours and when taking vacation you can only take up to the amount of your average hours worked. The management team is lost and don't know what their doing. The tuition reimbursement program is bogus because you have to be a team lead or higher to be reimbursed. The overall moral (at my particular target) is low and everybody hates coming to work.
bad,It Was Alright but not what I expected at all they were friendly at first then all at once the mood changed there attitude changed and they try working you like robots plus they don't wanna pay for the work they are asking and I find that if you work over so much they cut ur hours down so they don't have to pay
bad,"Target is a great company IF you are a customer. There are many shady practices when employees are involved, such as encouraging current employees to apply for advancement when the GM had already filled the positions from outside sourcing. The employee discount is only 10% which barely covers tax and often, employees that have worked for the company for a decade or more will only receive $0.10 annual raises. Heavy weight is placed on making corporate scores while less than the bare minimum is done to ensure employee satisfaction."
bad,if you like no hours constant critism horrible management clarksville target offers that. used to be a very fun place to work until they changed management  now absolutely horrible
bad,"I worked in packing and this is one of the hardest jobs I have ever done. It's a lot of lifting, heavy packing, and physically draining. I liked looking at the new items that came in to pack to ship to the store."
bad,"Typical day at work, go in, stock shelves, have 5 different managers come up and tell you what you did wrong, because they clearly have nothing better, or more important to do during the day. No supportive management. Annoying redundant brainless management, whose small talk consists of general platitudes usually spouted by grade school students. You'll encounter plenty of recursive b.s. during the work day, but this is typical of a large incompetent company, that leaks customer information like a sieve."
bad,I felt it has entirely to many people with authority and not enough communication they should definitely work on communication with their employees
bad,"I loved working there for the time being, but once my grandfather was rushed to the hospital with 2 aggressive cancers, they didn't seem to care. I had my weekend shifts covered because he wasn't expected to make it through the weekend. I then called them the following Tuesday asking if i could get Wednesday off for his funeral. They then told me I was terminated for ""two no call no shows"" and left it at that. They have no sympathy for their new employees."
bad,"Only advancement is if you know and are friends with the right people."
bad,"Company is losing money left and right, which is effecting the quality of work, and how they are treating their employees."
bad,"Unloading a truck, sorting freight and restocking the shelves was a basic day. Learned to manage time and tasks. Co workers were great, management was terrible. Hardest part was working overnight, best part was making real connections with team members. No real advancement."
bad,"Target claims they care about their employees but they really do not.  Here are a few reasons why..."
bad,They hired me only for two weeks for seasonal and then let me go. They didn't even tell me until the day of that they were letting me go.
bad,Target is a horrible retailer to work for. If you are an hourly associate looking to advance you're better off quitting and reapplying for a manager position as an outside hire. They rarely promote hourly to salary from within. They also expect you to have a degree to do anything but just being an hourly non supervisory associate. They will hire someone with no experience and a college degree over someone who has the experience and knowledge but no degree. If you are one of the people who are going down the path of a career in retail Target is not the place to be.
bad,"The worse job experience of my life, the managers make the work experience very horrible. Managers are very immature and make employees feel belittled and make employees complete job task that they should be doing."
bad,"Over the past 5 years the hours given to pharmacy technicians has continued to decrease while the demands increase.  All that matters are the number of prescriptions that you fill, not the guest service or patient care you deliver.  They push us to fill at a rate that is well beyond what is recommended by the Nation Pharmacy Board.  They cut the number of hours to the point that no one works full time so that they do not have to pay for benefits.  If you try to get another job, they cut your hours even more because you do not have ""open availability"".  Before the recession, Target was a good company to work for, but with the decreased hours and increased workload over the last 5 years, Target is no longer a good company to work for."
bad,"I worked as a cashier team member at the pickering location. It's all great and friendly when you first start but once you start working with the TL's (your managers) it is absolutely TERRIBLE. They are rude, selfish, and are horrendous at their job. I had to report one of my TL's for literally making fun of me so much it got to the point where I had to call in sick so that he wouldn't bully me anymore and he was my MANAGER! They don't make enough money to give you hours, I wouldn't bother applying! You'll hate it and leave just like everyone else did. "
bad,You need to watch your back at all times and they don't have your best interest at heart just another American company coming in and make fake promises to there workers
bad,"If you like poor training, drama, and to be shackled and chained to one store, this place is for you. The managers allowed employees to be bullied, never properly trained me, and fired me after I got a second job. I would highly recommend not working here. The people there are very belligerent and immature. They allow bullying and the offenders get a slap on the wrist. Rarely are the people or managers friendly. I often felt really out of place there and the general environment felt demoralizing. I'm serious when I say the worst place I ever worked and I would never work at another Target based on my experience."
bad,"Pay is terrible as are hours, management is clueless and rolls out new additions to workload without understanding how it works, the equipment is always broken and they are too cheap to replace it, people working are either incompetent or just don't care not that I blame them. If target is your only hope for employment just stay unemployed, you'll be broke working here anyway."
bad,not enough hours and no permanent position . Co-worker were okay.
bad,"Unpredictable schedule, insane hours (4am), Extremely demanding job for average pay, management poor...."
bad,"Loved working here at first, then it slowly got bad... really bad to a point where it is now #2 on my list of worst jobs ever, and ive worked on farm shovelling manure, roofing in the summer, landscaping... this tops it. It was grade 9 all over again people spreading bogus rumours and gossip of people personal business that isnt needed at work."
bad,"-hard work always went unrewarded"
bad,Target has no class you can put in five years in there and they don't care. Manpower is a temp place that is taking all jobs from employees for little money while they cut you out.The distrabution center I worked at was horrible you never knew if you would be in your own department or had to go to another to help out.The bosses are the worst right out of college and have NO experience in the role so you will never get a stright answer about anything.
bad,"I was not trained to do my job. When I told my manager, he said that's everyone's problem not just mine."
bad,"Terrible scheduling. I was constantly scheduled outside of my availability. working environment  was difficult and stressful, lack of team work"
bad,"I was here for about 2 years. It's the typical retail BS we've all come to know and loathe. At first it was great with all the team-building happiness but that quickly evaporated. "
bad,"Provide fast and friendly checkout service, resolve guest concerns in a positive helpful manner, work as part of a team, answer customers' questions, issue receipts, refunds, credits and accurate change, receive cash, check, credit card and automatic debit payments."
bad,"With open availability, the company give poor hours. Given the (run of the house) hours (the shifts no one wants). Every single day I have different hours (no two days are the same shift). Working evenings and weekends, with very random day shifts, sometimes only 6-8 hours off between shifts."
bad,After 3 1/2 years of being at target I can safely say this is not a great job for advancement. A summer job sure. but a real life pay the bills job not at all. was at one point working full time switched to a 4 am shift got docked to 20 hours with no chance for advancement or more hours. expectations are far to high for the 9 dollar tag they pay you. just my honest opinion..
bad,It was not a good place to work treated with no respect and dignity
bad,I work there for a little over a year. Working hard of and getting almost nothing for it. Once the old manager left it turned into more about results then about the people we are helping. at orientation they say it's always about the Guest well that's a lie. They only care about you working to make the store clean and if they think you are doing anything to better yourself to get out the cut you hours. I started going to school and my hours got cut then though non of my working days got in the way. Then after my son was born and i came back i was going from work three day a week to 6 hours every two weeks. jobs like this should only be for kids going though school to got a bad job and know what they need to do to work hard.
bad,"There is a clear power struggle among the workers, everybody wants to be the boss. The actual supervisors are vague, condescending and generally unlikable, you can not ask a question without being made a fool of, or your intelligence being questioned. I once came into work at 4 a.m only to find out the truck was canceled. Since I took cabs to work going home was not an option and I opted to stay and work. The next day instead of acknowledging that myself and a few others stayed, the supervisor thanked everyone who opted to go home, claiming it saved a lot of money on the payroll. If you want to work somewhere where you will be appreciated and not insulted on a nearly daily basis, you won't find that working at Target on the Flow team specifically. The best part of working here though, is the interaction with the guests."
bad,I wish it was run better. i had no problem getting the job done
bad,I enjoyed a great career at Target. The people I worked with and the pace of the business along with the companies culture made it a great place to work.
bad,come in set up check work load and begin work.
bad,a day at the warehouse was 12 hours and full of non stop work half hour for lunch and back to work. New members were forced to unload trucks for the full 12 period.
bad,"Although the Target Corporation prides itself on a fast, fun and friendly environment with several opportunities for advancement, it is disappointing in the least that this corporation does not uphold these standards. As a team leader, the workload for a person with an advanced degree and the duties expected were extremely demanding for the low compensation provided. In addition, the opportunity for advancement is very slim to none. I have never experienced an organization in which talent was not developed within the company and consistently new hires were introduced into upper level management positions without talent development of existing employees. As a result of continuous on-boarding of new hires within upper management there remained a lack of a cohesive vision and resulted in an unprofessional work atmosphere. I hope that the Target corporation begins to take a look at the management within their retail locations and work on the underlying issues that can lead to a high turnover rate in employees and the lack of retention of good talent within their organization."
bad,This store has poor management and they do not care how they treat their workers.
bad,to much high school drama. There was to much favortiizum.it was fun some days but Management sucked.
bad,"We Don,t get let in intill 3-5 minutes to our shift starts at 4a.m walk to back of the store get hand held pda for scanning,and a walkie.then I go and help with the unload of the trailer which takes about an hour or so,then I goto sales floor to stock electronics department,if I get done in time I help out the rest of the store.After the truck process sometimes they ask me to stay and help out in the backroom stocking.What I've learned is good stocking skills,how to use walk behind forklift,costomer service.Management could be alittle better...My co-workers are pretty much team players they all have good work ethics,and communication.The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck.The most enjoyable is the early out times."
bad,"• Utilized state of the art technology to manage the receiving process, freight flow and replenishment transition, and inventory."
bad,"target sucks, pays suck management sucks alot of favortism being show to certain individuals...."
bad,"Target is not a place I would recommend anyone to work at for the simple fact that they do not care about their employees. They put up an act like they do but in reality they actually don't. I say this because there have been numerous times where I came across problems and reached out for help and no one gave it to me until I took it to corporate. The things they allow the ""leaders"" to get away with also upsets me. As long as you're in a leadership position you can pretty much do what ever you want and no one will say anything to you no matter how it affects an entry level team member."
bad,"Very hard to move up in the company,and mangers get all kinds of special perks. The lower employees are like slaves to the managers. I remember my manager telling me to go get her coffee! lol i was like no."
bad,It was a very easy day at work I am already experenced in sales so I knew alot about my job already. The management was poor and the co-workers were not that great nor friendly either.
bad,Maybe I was a victim of bad timing but my experience with Target I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. They are soulless and unforgiving I don't know how anyone stayed at that place and retained their sanity.
bad,Management is horrible and they only want you to force/sell their RedCards to customers or else you will be fired.
bad,"Horrible management, unorganized, and disrespectful to staff. worst job ever"
bad,"WORST JOB EVER! I have never been treated so poorly in my life. I wasn't expecting much because it is Target but I was talked down to, yelled at, and scolded for having to tend to my very very sick 2 month old son. I had to rush him to the hospital and was yelled at for it the next day. I also worked there for well over a year and went on maternity leave and received none of the benefits I was promised. They didn't give me the proper breaks I needed while I was pregnant nor while I was breastfeeding."
bad,I enjoyed working for the corporation I stayed busy and my coworkers were very fun.
bad,"I hated the management in the niles target, and the people higher up on the food chain. I was treated poorly by the people just above me. However, I loved the people that I worked with on the registers. These were some of the nicest people and to this day I still go in just to see them."
bad,No respect from head and jr executives. You have to be unconsiderate with no true value to the company to be an asset.
bad,Been with Target for eight years as a receiver and have slowly watched this company get worse. They don’t value their employees. Yes they may bump pay to $15 an hour but then they cut hours and people start losing their benefits. Management most likely hasn’t ever worked in retail and doesn’t have any experience. Work expectations are a joke because corporate sits high and mighty in their cushy offices while trying to change the process in the store.
bad,Bad HR. Personally got fired for not showing up for work even tho i never got the full training on how to check yoyr schedule. Was given a website and a code to check your availability and my code never worked neither the app. Called the HR and even went up there for weeks never could get intouch. This place is the place i would tell people to work but if u don't like sloppy management and non proffesional HR then dont proceed unless they got if together.
bad,"TMs run the building, the senior management team is distant from operations, lack of support and make decisions based on hear say. Very poor work conditions."
bad,"Really bad management, they’ll accuse you of THEIR wrong doing, changed our schedules without telling us and punished us for it. If you don’t look happy, management will find a reason to make your day worse."
bad,"Busted my dream of one day working for Target, very disappointed ,   Very stressful,  no management support, especially HR,  very surprising, Hr hiring manager needs replacing"
bad,"Managers don’t care or help and coworkers are very rude and think they are your managers and try to tell you what to do people are constantly fighting and crying like children  this job isn’t even fun or worth it, they say they are rising the company minimum wage to $15 but im sure once that happens they’ll cut hours dramatically. Don’t waste your time with target"
bad,HR did a correct of action supposedly i was yelling for someone stealing my lunch when i have a high pich voice.I would definitely do more research before accusing people.It seams that everytime you do a report thmanagment retaliates
bad,"You may find good management and coworkers but most of them are incompetent, lazy, and sometimes so negligent that it can be dangerous. They don't care about you in the slightest. Worst job I've ever had"
bad,"Every week they have orientation Tuesday cause they can't keep anyone. The managers are awful not really helpful when your just starting. Target has a seniority based system  anyone who has more time then you tells  you what to do . I was in a department with 2 other guys but they didn't really work they just watch  and yell at you. They had me train under a 70 some year old man who should of been retired and he tells me on my 3rd shift i'm taking his job and hours, Its every man for themselves unless your in a clique. There really isn't much organization, the backroom is a complete mess most of the time. all in all i only lasted 4 months which is longer then most, it be good for a seasonal job or someone who needs income during summers off from college most sane people wouldn't be able to work here long term."
bad,"Look elsewhere..the people at target are horrible. Not all, but most. Especially the salaried team leaders. So much favoritism it's sickening. No advancement opportunities AT ALL."
bad,Management is unprofessional and business decisions are based on employee opinions.  Work schedules are not made available in advance.  Environment is dirty and unorganized.  Full time schedules are not available and they schedule half days and ask employee to extend hours on the fly and if you don’t extend it is made to reflect poorly on you.  They continue to hire new employees while unable to give current employees enough hours.
bad,This company just think about the on company 0 about the employee.we don't have any future and opportunity for grow with target no matter how long we work there we don't have any chance to grow.
bad,Management does not care like they act like they do. They will make you feel wanted just to get you to slave for them. They are childish and cause drama between team members by starting rumors. They are just waiting for the opportunity to stab you in the back and make you look bad. If you like to be mentally abused i highly recommend you work here. 10/10 would never work here again.
bad,I work for the store in Torrance California on Sepulveda Boulevard. The hours were not very good you could not survive working just to Target and paying your bills cuz you either don't make enough money and you don't get 40 hours a week. Management retaliates if you complain by cutting your hours.
bad,Keep a lookout for your hour's!! They don't keep track and they end up skipping a dam check! They loose your I'D's and social on a daily basis. They don't train you. You have to train yourself.
bad,After working for target for almost a year I realized just how crooked this corporation really is. They seem to like to lay off the entire team just before a pay raise so they can hire people for the lowest amount of Pay and continue the cycle. Not to mention the fact that if management or other employees do not find you favorable they will do everything they can to have that employee terminated. In example they will put that employee in situations that are designed to be failed
bad,"I started at target looking for a nice environment to work in as i transitioned to the next part of my life. But in doing so I have come to find that when all the managers are childish and like to gossip in a place of work your job can become not so great. I hate to sound like a loser but I developed anxiety at my last job and came to target to kind of try to get my head in the right space before trying to attempt to go back to school, i've lived on my own since i was 18 and with 11 hours a week i don't really know how I'm going to pay rent. I've asked for more hours and got them for a little bit but with in some weeks they shot back down and on top of that all the team leads hate everyone on a personal basis and not an actual work basis so if you took the time to read this avoid at all costs. Leads dating employees, Store manager aware and hiding it, Managers gossip, hours are only given to people who are already established employees, no where to shine. horrible place to work target should be ashamed."
bad,I worked at the target in michigan to say that it was a soul sucking place would be an understatement. The magament in my department was horrible. He would trash the people he was managing to guests. Many people went to HR and nothing was done. he would then get inraged at who ever said something about him to HR and make your life horrible. I would not recommend taking a job at target.
bad,I would never recommend anyone work there. they talk about being inclusive and fair but are not. they would only work 1 person closing and would expect them to do the work of 3-4 people. they do not know how or when to schedule lunch so i was constantly working and taking my lunch right before i left for the day.
bad,Where do I began it’s not target it’s the people that work there. They have there favorites that kiss there butt. So if you like kissing butt this may be the job for you. They don’t care about you or your life all they care about is the job and they change the schedule so much one day you working all week then the next time you check you may have 3 or 2 days .And there so called training sucks they show you something one time and expect you to get it
bad,Everyone is all for themselves. 2 faced and talk bad about everyone but nice to their faces. No one knows nothing because nothing is passed down them get in trouble for bot knowing. Kids with no manager experience are put in positions they have no people skills nor leadership qualities to train coach and develop. Its sink ir swim and they have no problem firing  slways short staffed.
bad,"I don't have much to say about Target. I know many people love and adore shopping there, but working there is a completely different story. My feelings and experiences with Target could be completely circumstantial but overall I have not enjoyed my time being a team member there."
bad,I don't know what was up with Target but it is literally the worst place I have ever worked at. The management didn't seem to know what they were doing. It felt oppressive. There were bad vibes.
bad,The store I came from the whole management team got fired. So I’m not sure if I enjoyed them much but I did appreciate the employee 5% discount everything helped considering I only made  $9.50/hr.
bad,"0 no integrity at region level"
bad,Anywhere else is better. Minimum wage to do supervisor's job. Cut hours. They expect you to do five peoples jobs for minimum wage. They preach hiring from within is a straight out lie.
bad,"très mal géré, trop d'employer et beaucoup de misere a avoir plus de 15heur semaine meme si promis 30h semaine"
bad,"I did not enjoy working at target. The Supervisors do not help you when you need it the most, they watch you and just tell you to do what you're already doing."
bad,"While training and working for Target I could see that it was a very good company, lots of opportunity for training and improving personal skills in your department. However the local site that I worked for (Wake Forest, NC) had the worst management at a job I’ve ever had! And I have worked 5 retail jobs. As a sales associate I liked my work, but the managers accused us of the drop in sales that was caused by the remodel, they got angry, made personal accusations, and were unsupportive when asked questions or wanted to talk about work load."
bad,"Amazing co workers ,but managers are always crying about hours Drama to the max I miss my friends don’t Moises my job at all, stressful always feeling insecure about hours"
bad,Mangers and HR are bad ever. They don't really giving for review meeting or raise sign papers. Nothing. I've views of people who are stolen things so mangers dont do good. Or anything. I hopefully this is need to wake up and change the better managers and store
bad,"There is so many issues to point out.  Keep this thought in mind.  ""That was then.  This is now.""  Then, the bosses were understanding, ""Just do your best.""  Now they are super hardnosed & mean spirited. ""If it's not done right, then it's not done.""  Then, their mantra was can ask for help.  Now, they degrade you because it stops them from attending to the Guests.... Then, you can ask for Time off 2 weeks in advance by logging in your request.  Bosses review time off every Monday.  Now, you MUST inform all bosses - including supervisors - at least 3 weeks ahead of time. (For the bosses & supervisors to all agree for you is no guarantee, let alone all knowing who approvedfirst.)"
bad,Two café mangers  and lead supervisor resigned in one year.  No appreciation for Starbucks as it contributes a relatively small amount to Target revenue.  Store management was absent except to criticize.  Understaffing café with one worker was normal practice.
bad,"Two women managers there horrible!!! One female manager is Hateful, Mean, and Vindictive. A very unhappy person who should not be in charge. They are doing nothing about this person. This woman yells, screams and will seek you out for emotional harassment. "
bad,"I was hired by Target during a transition period. The corporation was having a facelift both physically and also internally. So it was quite an experience adapting to everything. At first things were fine and then everything began to surface. What I noticed as a manager was that my employees had no consistency in daily routines and were being pulled in every direction. Also there were 5 managers telling each team member 5 different things. "
bad,"Upper leadership outside of store front is incompetent. Goals set are not realistic and overall work life balance quit mattering to upper leadership. Hours extreme daily and weekly you have no family, personal or friend time while working here last couple of years. Just greedy leadership with goals set."
bad,"Working for Target as a Starbucks employee was absolutely the WORST. "
bad,"Managers & team leads are not on the same page. Power struggles within the top ranks is felt by every employee. Some managers are so stressed by deadlines, they yell and attempt to belittle their team....No encouragement, only blame."
bad,target behind closed doors is a stressful and toxic work environment. Felt trapped being there and became very depressed to the point where I didn't want to show.
bad,"Distribution Center. Management is very confrontational and tries to intimidate. If you talk logic to them, they just keep up with nonsense. All management is trained the same, so it’s like talking to a rock with any of them.  Powered equipment is always broken and works terrible, yet you’re blamed for low production. Worst place ever."
bad,The management was rude. They didn't care about how you felt just as long as you got the work done. You could never be fast enough for them. Promised full time hours but got 20 or less. My mom also worked for this company and was there for 3 yrs. They purposefully cut her hours to one day so they wouldn't have to give her the benefits she should have qualified for if she worked at minimum 15 hours  they're horrible. The only good thing was they started my pay higher than the normal base pay. Typical retail job. Good for teens who need a part time job but have no bills or responsibilities.
bad,"So I was working at target for only 2 weeks, and then I was let go because of another employee who was using cocaine at work. The manager there was very stupid, and self absorbed, so he thought that my speed and productivity were the reasons that this crack head was acting so weird. He would do things like run through the store and commit huge safety violations. When I talked to him about it he wouldn't even remember doing it. I am begging you guys to stay away from here. I have done a lot of research and this company fires people impulsively all the time. My old boss even got fired for firing me, and you can go just about anywhere and meet at least one person who has been fired from Target."
bad,"I think this job is mainly for people who is retired, and just needs to work a couple hours a week.  It’s good for a college student who also just need to work four hours a day."
bad,"I couldn't stand the constant harassment in this company. I was a front end lead and every second of every day, I caught a manager stalk me for no reason. They used any excuse they could to pull me aside and tell me how awful of a worker I was. Mind you, I didn't do anything wrong, I reflected the training I received and always put my best out on the field. Multiple times, I pulled the manager responsible for me aside and asked what it was I did wrong and how she wanted me to improve. She never had any advice to give me. Literally, if they decide they don't like you, they will make you miserable. I hated my job up until the moment she let me go, because I ""mentioned to other coworkers"" about another job opportunity. I physically told me that was enough to let me go. I wouldn't wish working for that company on anybody. I even tried to dispute her letting me go through HR, and was told there wasn't enough evidence for them to make a claim. I went back and talked to my coworkers-she advanced at a different location. She got promoted."
bad,"Promised 28-32 hours a week.  Most weeks were less than 20 hrs, unless during seasonal times. Mngmnt was catty, unprofessional,  arrogant. High turnover. Hrly wage is generous, but ""less than"" PT hours make it impossible to NOT have to supplement your income w/another job.  Inconsistent team members who don't bother to show up leave you strapped short handed."
bad,"Didn’t feel anything good about this company. I worked my butt off and they laid me off after Christmas. I came in early to stock shelves , I worked the register when ever they needed me and the hours were in consistent... days, nights what ever they needed. I don’t recommend working here to anyone. It was miserable"
bad,"Have worked for target 6 years. Reviews always exceptional 5*. They started changing my shift for their benefit with no concern for me, so I took another early am job and changed my availability. They went into the system and took me off forever even though I didnt resign. They have lots of people who work full-time jobs and they give them hours, why not me? Discrimination"
bad,"I honestly would not recommend working here to anyone! I was with target for about almost two years and at first I really liked it! It was my first real job and I was happy with my 40 hrs a week at 12 dollars an hour. But favoritism is alive and well at target! Employees who have been there longer than I have and I’m talking 10 plus years, are scraping by with hrs! While some people get 40hrs and haven’t been at the company for a year. I wasn’t the perfect employee, I did call out and have some sick time too. 2018 was a hard year for me I lost 8 people in the matter of two months and when I  told the one manager that I was going to my uncles funeral, he asked if I could find coverage in the mists of arriving to the funeral! They don’t care about the employees or creating a safe environment for them! Sales drive the the managers crazy and the cutting of hrs goes into there pockets. By them cutting hours, they get a big bonus at the end of the year while most of us are begging for hours! So plz and I say this with a lot of knowledge of this company, do not work here! Plz you can find a better place to work without the stress of this work load and terrible hours"
bad,This is my first and my last time I’ll ever work for a company like this. There is nothing wrong with this company don’t get me wrong but the leadership at this particular Target is awful because of all of the favouritism between the leaders and employees.
bad,Management didn't care about workers and would tell us to do way more than we could possibly achieve. Not worth the time and stress for the pay. Team members all slack and I'd have to do 2-3 peoples worth of work for the same pay as 1. Not fair. Management picks favorites and not the hard workers.
bad,Asked for full time.   Never gave me full time hours...Managers are very young and clicky.  I wasnt happy there.  I wouldn't recommend this place for employment if you need money.
bad,Worked there for 6 years.  On my 6th year the new hires were making 15 cents less. I started $8.50 in the backroom and went to $10.65 due to national employee raises. Target raises are a joke 5-25 cents. The max you can receive is 25 cents and you have to be perfect employee.  I go back there some times to see friends there tired and miserable looks on their faces.  Target will wear you down.
bad,"Not sure if it’s the same in every store, but ETL’s and Store Directors never actually help do anything. They are the first ones to blame everyone else though. The team (mostly) tries their hardest but the amount of work they expect out of you is actually insane, and not letting people get OT to make sure the work gets done? Very counter productive."
bad,"I have worked here for 4 months , I was hired as a guest advocate . They’re having me do GSTL duties yet still paying me entry level & treat us like dirt. Severely under staffed , management promises you promotions , just to use you to do the job their promising you with out paying you for it and they use the excuse as “ oh we’re trying you out for the position “ , it shouldn’t take 4 months to try out."
bad,Working 4 hours a week sum it for me. I was a loyal employee for 33 years and got treated like garage at the end. Had to find something else because I could not make it on the hours that I was given. I work with a coworker for over 20 years she got more hours on price change.We were a team in the beginning  but not at the end.
bad,Must kiss up to leaders to advance. Unfair treatment of pregnancy and after maternity leave. Hrs get cut and position gets taken. No work life balance because of crazy schedules. Lots of drama. Bad management. perform many coworkers jobs because of lack of management from leaders. Low hours and days.
bad,Management is awful and don’t know how to do their jobs so all the work falls on the sales floor team. Corporate and management over works floor team and they have to constantly fear losing their jobs.
bad,"If you don’t mind being belittled, micro-managed, talked about, or prejudices then you might enjoy Target. Target 5 years ago and farther back was a great, fun place to work. They cared about the employees and gave back for all of the hard work."
bad,Not well run store everything is inconsistent.  Hours are all over the place  they promote idiots.  Just do your work don’t question anything  you lose your hours without even being told
bad,"You went into work, had a meeting, warm ups and then got your mod for the day or minute.  Poor management.  Very unfriendly employees. Worked as hard as I was able to.  Thought I was doing a good job because this was my first factory job.  Feedback from management was always negative."
bad,This store is not good. It treats its employees with diste and does not care at all about the repercussions. The store is dirty and Lanham managers are never to be found.
bad,"Even if your per hour rate was raised the a higher amount they gave you less hours so it wouldn’t make up for it. The management was not good and they gave you to much responsibility for one person. They once had one person covering the phone, dressing room, and cleaning up the sections while helping out new merchandise for the whole morning shift because they didn’t want to have to pay another person to help , by the way this was on the weekend"
bad,Definitely racial bias at Store 2407 in Danville Va. I worked there for 7 years and was put back to doing what i was doing when i was hired. The position was given to someone that had only ben there 6 months
bad,"Target is ran by mainly Hispanics in the Orlando Kissimmee area and if you do not look like them they will not hire you! I applied for 20 jobs 4 targets, only got 3 interviews which were all Hispanic. They asked 4 situational questions, they tell you there is no right or wrong way to answer yet it is! 98% of the workers are Hispanic. Go figure! The interviews were at The Millenia location and the Rolling Oaks location."
bad,"One manager would send you to another manager if you have a question and then that manager would send you to a different manager; you had to chase for an answer for anything. Scheduling was always an issue; I worked another job and they agreed they would work with me on my schedule. They then kept scheduling me for days I couldn’t work there and if I brought it up they told me to find someone to cover it. Another employeee told them a month in advance she had to take a week off to watch her kids, and she submitted a request which was approved. They still scheduled her for that week, and she told them she couldn’t come in and she didn’t. They then had no one to cover her shifts and overworked all the rest of us. I  would not recommend working here."
bad,Employed 2 years primarily in the backroom and online fulfillment. Wage structure is nonsense and does not reflect the amount of work that management put on a dwindlig number of employees. Every year they review your performance/ adjust wages by about 15 cents and then put up a donation box right by the time clock. Will never recommend Target to anyone.
bad,"I worked at the Westside Target store back in 2018 and was terminated because Target's anti American stance on Free Speech\ Gun rights. They claim to be inclusive but they are not. They so value their ""woke"" PC culture over your efficiency as an employee."
bad,"The store is always understaffed or overstaffed. Management doesn't take time out to train new hires for long before throwing them into the melee. There's extremely little consideration for the health of employees either. New workers aren't eligible for benefits. Employee discounts are 10%, a truly pitiful amount that will knock a couple dollars off a purchase at most. They can also only be used with cash, which is untraceable and thus untaxable, or Target's RedCard, which saves the store money. There's nothing but spite for employees here. Prospects are minimal. Look for another minimum wage job."
bad,"I was excited to start at target; however, the team leads for my department were impersonal and always to busy to talk one on one. ONE team lead in grocery was particularly extremely rude and had no conflict resolution skills, she was very passive aggressive with her tone and is the prime reason I left. They provided little to no training and got frustrated with me when I didn’t know the correct procedures or way to do things. They really need more organization within this company. I would not recommend working here."
bad,I worked there for 7 years. Just because I had health problems and couldn’t drive or even take the bus for almost 5 years. The number one problem is that they don’t want to give hours to employees. So that way they don’t give you the benefits. I have some friends that still working there and are getting around 16 hours a week. Those are people that being with the company for more than 10. They don’t care about their employees. In special the older ones.
bad,"Very poor upper management along with co store managers. Zero communication so you are in the dark on policies and store happenings, then once you figure it out things change again. "
bad,Not about the brand anymore with new fresh out od college management it is only about money in their pocket. Not a family oriented company anymore. .....
bad,Teams are unorganized. Everyone pretty stuck up for a target that gets no customers. Fyi no customers = no Hours. Work anywhere but here lol you'll just end up looking for another job in a month.
bad,"There is a $13 an hour wage but you won't get enough hours to make a living let alone get any benefits. The manager has told everyone who has asked for more hours that there are not 40 hours to be had at Target anymore unless you are a manager. It used to be that the employee let Target what hours they were available and Target would work with you to get the hours you wanted. They have cut everyone down in hours. And are happy to say that they are hiring more people. This is not an employee-friendly place to work. And if the store manager does not like you for whatever reason such as you might have looked at that person wrong, you are DONE! No hours at all, even if you have been with the company for years! This is a place that I have invested many years at and I am ashamed to say I am still working here. If you look at the employees that are working here, no one is smiling! That is the biggest thing that I notice that none of the employees are happy at my store and if you call corporate they don't care either! This retail store use to be the cream of the crop now it's towards the bottom. Even the people that work here as a second job hate it."
bad,"As the years went by working for target,it just started going downhill really bad! The managers act like spiteful kids.HR is a joke! All the managers are clueless! They expect you to do 3 people jobs in a 4 hour shift.I have never seen such lying managers in my life! This location likes drama! It gives them something to gossip and laugh about.Very unprofessional and unorganized!"
bad,"I started as a seasonal employee during remodel. I was working the graveyard shifts 40 hours a week and I was alotted a fair amount of time to complete my objectives. However, after remodel, my hours were cut drastically and the expectations for the short shifts I was given were far too high. I took time off of school to focus on work and despite my attempts to get work on a daily basis, I was not receiving enough work to make a proper living."
bad,"The new 2019 Target does not care at all about it's employees (or team members).  With the additional pay raise, everyone now gets much less hours per week.  Most employees no receive less than 20 hours per week."
bad,I was brought in to change the culture and was then beat down. By management for trying to change things. I was let go because another employee told a lie about me and I was not given the opportunity to defend myself.
bad,"Not worth the stress or the aggravation. You are a number, you can and will be treated like garbage, dont expect to make a career out of target. They care about money not you."
bad,"Target could really do so much better as far as benefits and management goes. There is always a lack of communication, implementing of rules after the hiring and there is no consistency. Would not recommend anyone to work for target. There’s no union, no benefits except for a cheap 5% for team members and anyone with a red card. Trash."
bad,No hours cut work load no support from management. Easy work and cross training available. Would get sent home before work was done to save on payroll.
bad,"Felt lied to upon hiring. Job description was not the same as reality. Hiring manager neglected to mention that all employees are expected to regularly help not only with cashiering, cut also cart retrieval."
bad,"Typically will start the day unloading a truck then pushing an amazing amount of stuff to the sales floor.  There is always more than a team can accomplish in one day because they dont schedule enough people. That won't stop management from telling you to get it all done.  It is known as a shortage culture.  It is the new normal.  It's fine if it looks sloppy, there will be more tomorrow."
bad,Lots of call out they called me almost every day to cover shifts. This was the worst paying job that I ever had. After a year I had an increase of 7 cents. I left. Got a better paying job.
bad,"I was fired from target because I had to rush my mother to ER and they viewed it as ""inexcusable absence"" even after I told them my reason for calling out. When I asked how I could have handled the situation better, the manager said, and I quote, ""that's not my problem"". The expectations are very high for a retail job but they pay above average. Managers are poor at their jobs and accuse before getting facts. Zero job security and a very high turn over rate. I would not recommend this job to anyone at all."
bad,"Working here there is no difference between the people who stay overnight and work late to make sure everything is beautiful, and the people who leave as soon as they can. Little to no training is given."
bad,"Very unpredictable, inconsistent hours. One week I would work 20 hours, the next week could be 12 hours. Whenever we stayed past 10:30 pm we never knew when management would let us leave. Sometimes we didn't leave until way past midnight."
bad,Team atmosphere in spite of the terrible leaders at the DISTRICT level. Everyone is stressed and scared for their jobs because of the hateful leaders at the DISTRICT level. The store teams and leaders are good people and try their best to take care of their teams.
bad,"Target’s hours they are able to give to employees are supposedly based off of sales. However, no matter how good the store is doing it is very rare that they will allow you to work over 30 hours a week- definitely never 40. This is because then they would have to give you benefits as a full time employee so very few employees at Target’s stores are allowed to do so. Target’s new policy also states that team members cannot pick up additional hours in other departments to fulfill their lack of hours they are often given."
bad,"Target might be a great place to work anywhere else except Abilene TX. Unfortunately all of the employees have their own little clicks, and if you don’t fit in, they will let you be aware and also let the upper management know. I tried to be as professional as possible... others may have thought I was too professional or no fun because I wasn’t into sex and partying. I left because the employees were not great coworkers and none of the management were true leaders. It felt like I was in high school all over again. I did my job correctly and successfully daily but unfortunately the people there were awful to work with. Pay is great for a high school or college student. No benefits are included until a full year of employment. The people is what makes the workplace a great place to work. Unfortunately this location has many flaws and can improve in many different ways."
bad,The job is fast pace and slow at the same time. The workplace is decent and appropriate. The job can be stressful when you cannot find a item or you have tons to look for.
bad,"The company keeps changing. It's not always communicated very well from corporate, to district, then to stores. Then it's left for interpretation. Three ETLS (managers) have three different views of how to implement the changes. You could get talked for not following the ""right"" one. The Salem store is full of people who love to gossip and back stab. One has to be very careful of their choice of words and who they tell things to. Even then there is a lot of word twisting. If you like to play kiss up to everyone, Target is a great place for you. If you're looking for a place to earn a pay check, enjoy your work, look else where. Hours vary each week. They use many excuses as why. One manager is constantly being talked to because he adds hours when he shouldn't so at the end of each month they're calling people to tell them not to come in to work to cut hours to balance it out. If you have a question that is one no one knows the answer, good luck getting one with in a reasonable time. The store motto and joke is ""more to come"" which rarely happens. Or the question is not important to managers to take their time to find out the answer. Training is usually a shift for new hires and they're often left alone with in an hour after they started."
bad,"The target in Bryant,Arkansas  is terrible they give hours on favoritism instead of how hard u work, some managers don't have management skills. They do not know how to communicate with the employees"
bad,"Going into this job, I read the indeed reviews and all of them were the same ""terrible job, they work you to the bone, but the discount is nice"". I decided to ignore these and that was a mistake. I dreaded going to work every single day, I was treated like a worker bee and was never recognized for the things I did and when I was it always came with something I did wrong. The management was terrible and it never felt like a comfortable environment. I always felt like I was doing something wrong or was going to be ridiculed for something I was told to do. It is obvious that they don't care about people personally and only on a ""you work for me and if you weren't here I wouldn't get a paycheck"" basis and an example of that is me being called by a different name every time I came into work for the first 6 months, by managers and people who talked/worked with me quite often. I felt very invisible and unappreciated and the day I left Target was one of the best days I've ever had."
bad,Target used to be a great job. They have changed how they do things in the past few years. They no longer value employees and see them as cogs. They use scare tactics of losing your job if you do not do what they want. They cut hours every chance they get and except you just to be happy that you have a job. Management does not listen to any needs of their employees.
bad,"Target has a new policy where they expect employees to do the jobs of six people!  So many people have left in the past couple weeks, it's ridiculous.  I don't know who dreamed up this ""advocate"" thing, but it's nuts."
bad,Target has implicated several new changes to the company. They are designed to cut everyone’s hours but demand more work. Employees use to get 40 hours a week but can only get 24 to 32 hours now. With these new changes it makes it impossible to get benefits
bad,Management is awful and biased towards the team members. Constantly being hypocritical and changing the way the store is run only to create a more hectic work environment.
bad,I don't think so terrible cliquey to the extreme. All primadonnas basically the worst working experience in 60 years. I was legitimately I'll had to take time off with sick notes HR was just young foolish and ignorant
bad,I loved my coworkers. Management is fake. The hourly pay is descent but hours aren't consistent. They over work you. And you have to be there 10+ to grow within the company.
bad,They think of you as replaceable and even if you get in a car crash they do not excuse it. Not flexable at all terrible hr and maanagement regret working here completely.
bad,okay job for college students not for a career for a regular person. Requires you to do a lot very unorganized employees and guests were stealing from the store
bad,That place was horrible absolutely sucked working there that's all I can say horrible managers horrible work environment horrible training and just an all around joke to work at
bad,"The target i worked at was a super target, store manager was there since the store opened and clearly hardly ever took vacation; it was obvious his life was work and his good days are when corporate didnt complain about something major; every visit from upper management would end in disaster due to either employees failing to keep up with the ridiculous standards that'd make you think they want you to sprout 4 arms at once. more than three times a week i'd have to play damage control and make sure morning crew could do their jobs but the cost being i couldn't clean up for the night. I'm sure other places are better than the target i worked at but from that experience I'll have trouble recommending to anyone to work in a target."
bad,"If you like being controlled and micromanaged, you'll enjoy this job. Team leaders ( though not all ) are aggressive ( and will yell at you ) and use intimidation tactics. Because of that, I eventually lack all respect for those who did. They're also nice and helpful to you at first, then their true colors come through after you've been there for a couple of months. And when you try to talk to them about an issue you're having about not given your allowed breaks, they later passively aggressively mock you as having a prima donna moment, very mature *scarcasm*. One leader will also tell you it's okay to take your break, then another will get angry at you for taking it. Then instead of owning up to it, she blatantly watches as we're being called into a huddle ( just to get yelled at, I might add ) for what she initially said we were allowed to do. Contradictory management skills (or lack thereof) and always seemingly ""quietly-angry"" all the time, confusing it for ""confidence"" when it's actually intimidation. That's the last time people younger than me ( or anyone ) will ever tell me what to do, intimidate me, or yell at me at job. A word of advice, respect and appreciate your employees, treat them right ( and like adults ) -- and maybe they'll actually want to stick around and do the work."
bad,“team leads” are managers and they are uneducated idiots. people do not know how to lead or manage anybody. the job babied people who slacked and did not reward those who didn’t
bad,When I first started working there I loved it. The guy that hired me was nice. And then one day he started saying things that were not okay to say to a 17 year old. I reported it and nothing was done. A few months later he told me that I basically owed him something because he gave me that job. Then a few months later he did something again. And again I reported it and again nothing was done. The managers get away with things that another person wouldn’t. We never have more than one person closing in my department which leaves me to run everywhere trying to help people that come in. And everyone is scared of their managers because the managers freak out and yell when you do something wrong. All except one manager. We didn’t have a HR lead for months and it showed because look what happened.
bad,horrible place to work. the store manager is a bully and very rude to her employees. asking for more hours will get you less. can't live on 12 hours a week
bad,"A bad place to work hourly. You will not be promoted or advanced based on merit unless you know someone who can get your name to the head of the list. Also they are currently making sure all hourly workers work only part time hours so as to deny benefits, like health insurance."
bad,"I didn’t work here, but applied and interviewed. "
bad,"After a hectic Holiday season (which is obviously typical in any retail environment), employees at Target are graciously rewarded with having their hours suddenly and unexpectedly slashed. Many people in my department (grocery) worked four hours a week for several months, making Target's much-lauded push to make $15/hour the minimum for all employees ring rather hollow. Of course, this also has the added benefit for Target of not having to give any of their employees benefits of any sort. "
bad,"If you weren't in the right cliques, you had to watch everything you said or did. "
bad,"When I first started  working at target in beauty, it was a great experience I helped guest with products, merchandising the area and focusing on guest services. After new managment came hours we’re cut beauty team members were made to cover multiple areas in the store on top of their area. When corporate would come the managers would tell us to lie about the extra work we do and say we’re only in beauty all the timefocusing in guest which was not the case beauty was everywhere else except beauty. They cut your hours and expect you to be on call whenever they need people to come in. As being a full time employee and being charged for insurance I wasn’t making full time hours anymore to be able to afford living and my insurance. They treat the workers like factory machines and no matter what you do nothing will ever be good enough. If you want you sanity and want to be appreciated for your hard work I’d advice not to work for this company."
bad,"Target prides itself on being Fast, Fun, and Friendly, however most times its needlessly stressful and encourages poor work ethic. Productivity above all else which is how most companies are, yet Target systems are easy to abuse and fake progress while staying under the radar due to so many individuals touching all products. Also Target has very little problem stringing you along with enticing advancement, mobility, and great work environment, yet consistently relocates hours to friends and favorites, discourages moving about company by losing paperwork or nit-picking rules to place a coaching on record to lock you in position and friendly work environment essentially translates to here is a high five now enjoy your twelve hours work week or a scheduled event that inevitably falls through since the only ones scheduled are the favorites. I have been on both sides of this problem as a favorite and not due to constant management changes, department changes, staff changes, rule changes, ultimately its almost impossible to devise a working system when its like target picks an idea out of a hat every week or so and says lets run this idea and if it doesn't show any progress lets pull another."
bad,"at target i was a cashier and cart attendant and we had alot of work to do as the cart attendant take care of carts in and out the building and clean up bottle redemption. the problem we had with management is that in bad whether they wanted us to still be out side and get carts,also with bottle redemption they never gave us gloves to work with the glass so if we got cut they alme us."
bad,HR always messes up people schedule. For months they don't have hours to give and they even cut off hours and you have to make up all the people they cut. You will definitely be overworked and unpaid. They set unrealistic standards and get upset when you don't finish. There are some people who have 8-hour shifts and only work for 1 and walk around while others have to rush to finish and they do not give those with one-hour workload more work. They actually get mad and act busy if they are given more work.
bad,"Management is oblivious and doesn't care how everyone else feels. They tell us we can come to them with our concerns, but when we do they tell us they can't do anything. Majority of the employees in our department have had mental breakdowns. Many have broke down crying because of how badly everything is there. I never felt so undervalued and underappreciated in my life. We are expected to do everything. Everyone in the store has a phone, yet we are the only ones expected to pick it up. Everyone took advantage of us because we were the only ones who ever did anything. Then we would get blamed when things weren't done. The people they hired don't do anything. And some people who have been working there a while don't do anything. If we try and talk to someone about it they say things like ""That's just how she is, we can't do anything about it."" "
bad,"Literally the worst company I’ve ever worked for!!! It was really due to the management though, it’s HORRIBLE !!! Pay is good but I’d rather make $7.25 than to work at the Huntsville, TX store ever again. Also, they barely give hours... they start off good but then all of a sudden your getting scheduled one day a week."
bad,Trying to communicate with management was terrible. After having time off they cut all of my hours without communcating. I called time after time to speak with management never got a call back.
bad,I worked at Starbucks for two weeks. Never received proper training for Starbucks beverages nor Target. Walked into a department without a manager. Burnout occurred quickly from being understaffed and stretched in all directions. Upper management never checked in.
bad,Terrible hours. Terrible management. Terrible decisions. Overall the process of working at target is draining to the point that many people choose to stop showing up after less than two months than work there.
bad,"Missoula MT Target is horrible. You're given way too much to do and a short amount of time to do it. If you have anxiety or depression, they don't care at all. Instead, they make you feel like it's your fault. They play favorites. Managers let a lot of really bad things slide while getting upset over smaller things, especially if they don't like you and want you fired. Managers tell someone they'll get a promotion and then never follow through, only hiring or promoting people they personally like. HR isn't there for the employees at all, but they try to make us think they are. At $13 an hour, it's not even remotely worth it."
bad,"Started 2 years ago and the environment and hours were amazing, then new management came in about six months ago, now hours are shrewdly given to only the favorites on staff and the managers are demeaning and demanding for the $12 an hour they pay"
bad,Bad management and hr will not help you unless they like you and they some how always go over pay roll so hour go down and don't have enough money to pay bill or rent
bad,I would never work at target again they are slave drivers they make rules up as they go Management is terrible I would not advise anybody to work for TARGET.
bad,One team lead will tell you one thing then an ETL will tell you another and then someone else will go and say something completely different. The job is more trouble than it’s worth. Currently work there but I’m always looking for a new job. Everyone is disposable to management. I know too many people who have promoted themselves to guest aka they quit.
bad,When I started I thought everything was good even after hearing all the negative things but I just went on with my routine. After a week all they do is use you management is terrible they stand around doing nothing and if you cross their path while they have to do something they will send you to do their job and come check if you finished it. They send you to do 5 things at one time and everyone wants to overstep everyone and think their a manager which was a huge problem when I worked there. Believe me when I tell you the target in Clifton NJ is not the place to work unless your seasonal and you might want to quit even then. Employee's are terrible and talk about each other and nothing gets done in that store !!!
bad,"Worst company you could possibly work for unless you're in school. The management is a joke and the competent workers are not nourished, probably because team leads are afraid of their jobs being lost. You don't get paid good at all. The pay is laughable."
bad,"It’s such a toxic environment they treat you good only if you get red cards, and if you try to move up they make it impossible and they give you correctives for everything, managers were rude and offensive at times, hours are bad like yeah it’s great we got 12 hourly but what’s the point if you only get 15-20 hours a week I was told I was gonna get garunteee 24 hours a week but that hasn’t happened in a long time, the co workers are great but management just is bad and by management I mean GSTL they don’t care about you as a person just what you can provide to them."
bad,A good starter job but that’s it place is going downhill. Been there for over five years and I worked hard and earned very nice reviews but when the minimum went up I didn’t go anywhere now I’m at targets minimum wage that’s a slap in the face
bad,Been with this company for many years a lack of pay raises every year. They only care about people who suck up. Always turns a blind eye to problems and not willing to fix issues.
bad,There isn’t anything good about working for Target. It’s not even worth the discount they give. Hardly get any hours. Leads and higher up are very fake .
bad,If you enjoy being micromanaged this is the place for you. Have an idea to improve the process? Too bad. Only good thing about the company are the employees who DO the work.
bad,I am not at liberty to discuss the lack of quality employment at Target or the lack of advancement opportunities with this company. Temp or as needed employment with selected schedules that made it all but impossible to gain medical benefits.
bad,"My team lead told me you're not working hard enough for $15 an hour. I make $12.50 an hour. She talks about her employees to others and chooses favorites. If she doesn't like you she won't schedule you many hours. She told me she doesn't schedule me because I stand around. I am type one diabetic and have poor circulation in my feet and legs. I'm also on disability. Everyone else talks, stands around and complains. Do not trust anyone in the clothing department at Des Moines  North. I would not recommend working for this team lead. She's terrible"
bad,"It has become a terrible place to work. Management gets worse and worse by the month. Used to be a great place to work, but now management prevents team members from doing the job requirements they are expected to do. They set people up to fail. They will tell you to do multiple things that take a long time (sometimes things not even in your area) , then yell at you if your area isnt looking good enough. They have recently started to pile on extra work that prohibits your work area to be picked up. VERY STRESSFUL AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE JOB. I DONT RECOMMEND WORKING HERE."
bad,"i was hired as a seasonal team member and everyone seemed mostly nice at first.  i guess if you're seasonal you're just a throw-away worker and you don't matter.  my coworkers were very mean and would comment on how slow i walk (i have a limp) and i would catch them talking trash about all the annoying new people ""who can't learn anything"".  my manager was a very mean lady and she would make snide comments about everything.  they promised me 2 weeks of training but gave me about 4 short days, changed my schedule and for whatever reason gave me a week off, then when i came back they said i was done with training.  coworkers keep to themselves and only a few were nice and helpful.  i got fired for not getting stuff done fast enough when i was trying hard to learn the ropes on my own. the pay was good but they were stingy with hours and would sometimes cut peoples' shifts or tell them not to come in.  "
bad,"I was hired, before the holiday rush, to be an Electronic Team Member and work 40 hours a week. After accepting the job I worked there a month and a half and never got over 20 hours a week. Furthermore, I never worked in Electronics. I was ether a stocker for toys or worked in the back in the warehouse. In my time there I fought against that and snuck into Electronics to make sales because that was why I was hired and that is what I am experienced at. Everytime I did, I made sales that weren't big in my opinion, but compared to what the store put out they were big, but was always sent back to toys. If I had known Electronics Team Member meant stockboy or toy stocker at only 20 hours a week I would have never accepted the job offer"
bad,Fun to work there but you can’t talk to over employees for too long. There’s a break room but you have to pay for lunch or bring a lunch. Management was unfair and they don’t let you do what you need to do at times. The staff is friendly as far as co workers go.
bad,"High paced productivity driven company that will not work with employees. Say they want you to succeed but are unwilling to make the changes so they can succeed. Very poor management and very high turnover rate. I would anyone to stay away from this company, they lure you in by making you feel like your part of a team. But once you are working all that goes out the window."
bad,I I'm so disappointed with the promised that I was gonna be permanent and give my 100% every day and thats how they reward the employees. Then they say that you can apply again ( thats make no sense you already are working there why dont let you stay and you dont need to begin again sinse 0)
bad,i hated working for target. the only positive in the place is that the people you can meet as far as coworkers go are very nice. however management hates you and does not work with you
bad,This is not a good environment. It sucks the life out of your soul once you walk in the door. Like I want to watch Harry Potter not live it. target equals demeantors. I want to watch harry potters face get sucked off not have target suck me off. JK Rowling is always saying random stuff about it next its gonna be about this place. xoxo kisses.
bad,"The management is constantly in a power struggle with one another, it seems. Several of them are rude and condescending. For decades, my store has provided PB&J ingredients for people who can't afford to buy lunch, and they decided to get rid of that last year. I can't see how saving such a small amount of money outweighs the relationship with employees. I used to like working for Target and genuinely looked forward to going to work. That changed when the management changed."
bad,If u not friends or related to anybody in management don't expect much. The employees that do much of nothing get rewarded and promoted and the employees that actually work hard have to do everybody else's job beg for hrs be micromanaged and get no recognition for anything just criticism
bad,"Target use to be a great place to work. You felt like family. Now management over stepping and talk to you any type of way. And dont let a visit come. Everyone is so proper and friendly now. I always wanted to grow with this company but unfortunately there is no room for growth. They pick and choose who they want to promote next. Don't expect hours if your not a team leader or one of their favs. Did I mention you have to get carts? Yep, it dont matter what dept you in that include cashiers."
bad,"Target only drug tests the security team but not for the other team members. They've hired people with criminal/felony records and those people stole from there as well. "
bad,"Sometimes there's too much communication. Like I heard different things from different managers consistently. They put too much pressure on ETL's and the team members. It's Target, not a career job.  Calm down some. $12 isn't enough for as much as they want you to do."
bad,If all of the management was on the same page it'll be a better work place. The job rules changes every week. Hours are always cut unless it's close to a holiday. They expect one person to do too many tasks. The team members complain everyday!
bad,"If you are willing to work 50 to 60 hours a week during high peak seasonal times I would recommend doing it. Unfortunately all that target is good for is making a lot of money during high peak times. At first it may seem like a good gig as decent hours are given and general team members are usually good people, but once you get into management it can be frustrating. Target hires folks straight out of college to be executive leaders, which causes problems for the folks who have been there for years with no chance of promotion due to lack of degree. I personally believe experience is more important than education, and I feel during my time with Target many other team members felt the same. There are also positions that exist on the brink of management and member and while working in these positions expectations are ridiculous, essentially one is expected to work management hours and take on their responsibilities while only being paid as a member. Beyond this, during my time I was aware of fraternization between managers and members, which resulted, multiple times, in promotion of said member who was involved in fraternization."
bad,Working at target was alright at first but the management is horrible. They use you hard at first but anything minor theyre very picky and they screw with you and your hours.
bad,"This is in relation to one store, not the whole company."
bad,Opportunities were few and far between.  Extreme favoritism amongst middle management and store leaders leaving those unwilling or unable to work out in the proverbial cold.
bad,"I worked at the Cheyenne Mountain location. Management is terrible. They will look for any reason to get angry with their team members, if you’re not one of the few favorites, on the rare occasion that they decide to leave their office. They complain about floor coverage but they all take their breaks together for over an hour which does take away coverage. They constantly talk about what a great open door policy they have but when you go to them with a concern you become the bad guy. If you’re okay with being overworked & treated terribly this is the place for you."
bad,"The best way to say this. Target used to have a business model of an inverted pyramid and a business philosophy stating that any of it's major problems were created from the top down, it's CEO used to believe that since the major decisions and responsibility lay in the hands of the head of the corporation it's leaders also held accountability for the companies successes or failures. That is no longer the case, no the company leaders makes there decisions and regardless of failures it is never there fault or responsibility to make it right. The only ones accountable for making the Target corporation successful are it's low level staff, and the further up the chain of command one escalates the less accountability on that person to make things function. There truly is a mentality of omnipotent superiority that the company leaders are never flawed in there decision making."
bad,management doesn’t know how to handle situations within’ the store and sometimes with customers. management is young and entertain drama on salesfloor.
bad,"Receiving unloading and picking stocking  first receipt "
bad,They’ll tell you what you want to here to get you in the door but beware nothing is what it seems. No wonder they have a high turnover rate. It’s all about them and there numbers and they couldn’t care less about you. Oh and did I mention in order to get paid for there 6 “Paid Holidays” you actually have to work that day if it falls on your regularly scheduled work day. Have nothing good to say about Target. Hands down the most mismanaged company I’ve ever worked for.
bad,There is no training. I was employed for three months before I was given any kind of guidance on how to do my job correctly. Untrained employees trained me when it is said constantly that a certified trainer must train you
bad,"They never schedule enough people to do the job, Management takes no responsibility, for the problems they create, and job advancement isn't too common. Injuries are common, but aren't reportable."
bad,"Very cut-throat, I was afraid to ever ask questions and afraid to call in sick because of their strange attitude to seasonal workers. They seemed to be so upset every time someone had to switch schedules, or didn't know how to do something. Very difficult because I would often run out of change in my drawer, and the team leads would not react for up to 10 minutes at a time. There was almost 500 hired workers at my location- I hated it, no one knew my name except for a couple of the other cashiers that I was often working shifts with. They definitely saw me as a number there, and most of the time they saw me as an inconvenience. I felt unwanted there as soon as I started working."
bad,"This place sucks. When I first started 17 months ago it was fun and my team got along great, but then it slowly turned into a high school environment with terrible higher ups. My direct team lead is awesome. All three I have worked with in Starbucks have been great and helpful and get the job done. Their direct manager is AWFUL!! She is so incompetent when it comes to Starbucks. We lost our team lead a couple months back and she was of absolutely no help to us during the transition. It should have been her responsibility to order supplies and such for us, but she didn't even know when our order came in. The only time she ever comes to Starbucks is to get her coffee and to very rudely tell us what we are doing ""wrong"" even though it never actually is and she doesn't understand our basic procedures. The store lead has also been quoted as saying ""I hate your entire team and if it was up to me I'd fire all of you."" Very immature. Never says anything nice to us to make us feel appreciated. The greedy fat cats at corporate also decide it's ok to drop everyone's hours by 10-15 for two months like we don't have bills... Target is a JOKE to work for and that is why I am here looking through jobs, so I can get out of here."
bad,"There is no room for growth within the company unless you are super friendly with upper management. I felt very uncomfortable a lot of the times because I was the only person of color working there. People would mistake my name and call me Shay, my name sounds nothing like Shay. I had told a ETL member that my goal was to be promoted within the HR department and she looked at me and said you would need a degree for that. I actually have my Bachelor Degree. I was forced to work with people who would constantly complain about the Black Lives Matter Movement. It was the worst position of my life and I'm glad I was able to find something much better."
bad,Management is horrible. They have favoritism and when I asked them if I could take off for a funeral the manger of my section said and I quote “ Don’t waste my time coming back.” Try and avoid it at all costs. They don’t care about you. On my first day by myself they gave me a ton of work in a section I have never even been around before.
bad,"Would schedule you till 11pm, but keep you their until 1-3am, and expect you to be back at 6am the next morning."
bad,"It was all bad. Everyone I know said working at Target was a bad idea and it's the worst place to work but I needed a job. I was specifically a soft lines member and let me tell you, the store is always a mess. None of the managers are every on the same page and us members under them tend to get scolded for THEIR mistakes. They are also really difficult when it comes to needing days off no matter the reason. I missed one day of work because I was sick and had to head home the next day because I was going to throw up and didn't want to throw up on the clothes. And my manager was still rude about leaving work.They would work me from 3 pm-11 pm one day and then 8 am- 4 pm the next day and it was killing me. ANd like I said management is pretty rough. I was technically fired because I called out a specific manager on the rude and wrong stuff she would do to us and 5 more people quit because of her within the following month. DONT WORK HERE"
bad,"Bad culture, the systems used to stock and or order stock are very bad for customers and employees alike. Management does not want to update the logistics to better serve all just want defend it as the outdated mode of operation is job security for management"
bad,"Everyday you were expected to stay until everything was completed even if it wasn't your area. The main reason things never got completed was because the manager never hired enough people for certain roles and never scheduled according to expected busy days/weekends. "
bad,"This company has the highest and worst turn over rate than any company I know of. I worked there 6 yrs and was told to move up the ladder to do as many tasks and responsibilities as I could... I was a trainer, ERT and GST, did rework and many others tasks and all at no additional pay, went thru 9 in house interviews for several positions and it boiled down to not what you know but who you know. This place is ran by fresh out of college newbies who have no clue. So if you want a good paying job in a place you will hate....Target is the place."
bad,"I worked for store 1919. In the beginning I loved my job, after six months everything changed. A typical day for ship from store or flexible fulfillment is picking orders guest place online and packing them.  Deadlines were constantly changes as well as the way to do the days task. Team Leads would get very hateful when things started to get the slightest behind. The store is very unorganized. Management doesn't work well together."
bad,"would not recommend this job. They allow team members to do whatever they want and then work the good workers to death. They call and ask you to work on your days off, even if it is your 10th day in a row"
bad,target was some of the most stressful days of my life. the management just picked on whoever was easy to pick on. nobody there took the work seriously.
bad,Managers are disrespectful they overwork you and schedule against availabilit they also will not allow u to take time off unless put in 3 weeks n advance
bad,"I would not recommend anyone work at Target unless they are a WORK HORSE and/or KISSEY ASSEY.   The management was rude, cut-throat.  They target you from day one knowing who will stay and who will not. Maybe that is why they call themselves Target.  "
bad,"When you first start, they butter you up and make you feel super welcomed. Once you’ve been there a couple months, it’s sucks. The management is AWFUL. There have been ETLs in the building that talk about team members to other team members. Professional right? I got pregnant and was told from management it’s not that big of a deal and still have to meet the needs of Target; so if that means get up and down on ladders and lifting heavy things, then I have to do so. I will never work here again nor recommend anyone to work here."
bad,not a very good place to work very stressful very hard to deal with the management they always tell you to do one thing then its opposite they make you hear what you want to hear to make them feel ggod about themselves.
bad,"My target has poor management, very inconsistent scheduling, petty unorganized Human Resources manager, few opportunities for career advancement and was frequently under staffed. We have poor quality team member equipment and and outdated store layout."
bad,"It is very hard to move up with this company unless you have friends in higher places. Personally, never helped with scheduling with school/second job. The pay was not worth the effort or work put in. Raises were minimal and training was less than. It felt like being set up to fail."
bad,It was a nice environment to work in but 3 of the team leaders were very disrespectful and treated you like an in human they force you to make you bullie customers into getting their target red card
bad,This company has really just become a shell of what it used to be. No longer are employees appreciated and you can tell by the cut in hours. Also they don't give you a break after 2 hours and send you home after they've burned you for 4 hours straight.
bad,This place was very political. They are very childish as leaders I was involved in more then one conversation with other leaders for doing spiteful things such as waiting for you to leave for the day then pulling team members you delegated tasks off the tasks and not communicating it to store leadership so your left looking like you didn't leave instructions.
bad,I really didn't learn anything while working there. Management didn''t care which created a very stressfull environment. I enjoyed meeting new people.
bad,"Too much work, never enough time in a day to finish, always understaffed. The employees were always gossiping or being cutthroat. Not used to working with a lot of drama on the job. The off days were terrible for a family man and the pay was not enough for the amount of work."
bad,"There were usually two people working at a time at my location. This made it very difficult considering we were a tier 1 store, with high sales. We always had a lot of guests and never enough people to serve them properly or work efficiently."
bad,"They make it sound so good during the interview but it’s far from the truth. Everything about this company is “prod”(production)! They care nothing about you as a person. A woman had a baby with medical issues and they made her come in after her maturity leave was up because we were in busy season and they need her there for overtime. Another woman had worked there since the doors opened on the place (20 yrs) and when she retired, she didn’t even get a card. There is no room to advance. Once you’re hired in in that position, you’re stuck in that position. If you want to be a manager/GL/OM, you better have a four year degree or be in the military. They preach safety but when it comes down to it it’s all about prod. They want you to stay hydrated but don’t use the bathroom unless you’re getting your numbers. They raise the product numbers every chance they get so they can more out of you. Rumor has it that the more the managers get sent out, the bigger bonus checks they get."
bad,You will constantly be given busy work. No set hours unless your management. All management is hired from outside they do not promote. They ban overtime so you can't ever try to get a little extra money
bad,Management played favoritism. They were rude and condescending to employees. Inconsiderate to feelings and emotions. Lack of communication with hours and shifts. They were not flexible with hours and were harsh if you couldn't make the schedule they provided for you. they were racist and prejudice.
bad,"While I was a seasonal to hire, I was told that the job I was doing was always outstanding. I always pushed for sales when it came to their redcards but they treat you like nothing matters. You wont be placed if you are not a favorite"
bad,"I worked at target on 3 day 12 hour shift schedule and it was great I did above average work, worked hard had no opportunity to move up even know it would have changed my life and probably had me succeed in a special way."
bad,"poor management, rude and back stabbing employees. i just went in to do a job make a little money. the line they give about trying to retain at least 15% of the temp hires only applies to the kids who are in the ""click"" and only want about 10-15 hours a week. the so called loss prevention nit picks certain things about certain employees, goes under a code name in the store but then makes it obvious that he's an employee when he is in and out of stock rooms, offices, and such! "
bad,I worked here for four years two being a team member two being a team leader. I never got the support I needed or the team members I needed and I was always the last one to leave. Store manager was awesome until I found out there was no confidentiality.
bad,"Was working here for a few works as a full time employee as a second job. Working two jobs can be tiring and mistakes can happen which anybody with two jobs can relate and understand. On last week at target I missed writing down one day that I had to work and pretty much did a no show no call unintentionally. So when I return to work the following day i reviewed my work schedule they had up to write down my total hours and saw that I has missed work the day before and tried explaining to HR and my team leaders. They said it was okay that it happens. So I thought nothing of it. But at end of my shift that day they called me into the office and told me I was terminated because it was considered a no show no call and I was within my 90 days. I wasnt surprised but alittle frustrated because they didnt try to understand my situation or even give me a chance. I mean not even a warning or write up. I asked why wasnt I called or contacted in regards to my shift that day and I simply got a “we dont do that here” response. Yes, I do understand its my responsibility to write down my schedule which I did but missed a day. If my no show no call that day was intentional why would I return to work the following day. That makes no sense to me. Work environment wise is bad. The morale at work is low, employees are stressed out, team leaders have favorites, lots and lots of brown nosing, co workers snitching on each other, leaders there are unprofessional, training is so so bad, unorganized. My first week there they didnt have my training schedule, they let me train with different people each"
bad,"At first i loved working here i worked with great people and a lot of hours, but the management always sucked. I was working 10 hours some weeks some of my co-workers worked even less no one can make a living with that."
bad,I’m not sure if all the stores are ran like the one I worked at but all the managers except one would constantly lie or not keep their word over worked and usually understaffed was decent when I started but is too ridiculous now.
bad,"I did not like working here.  You work hard and get no kudos whatsoever.  Coworkers were nice, but some above you such as managers in the office are fake."
bad,"There eas no chance of going up in any department if the manager didn't care for you. They only care about selling Creidt/Debit cards and didn't care if you tricked people into it. Strong disrespect for any associate that wasn't playing a dumb ragdoll. I left because I was kicked off the schedule after they learned I was dating someone in a different department than mine. It sucked if I'm blunt, but it is part-time. The raises are a joke too. 25 cents after a year with no trouble and being a highly praised cashier."
bad,"Was passed over multiple times for promotions due to me having a child. I was complimented numerous times by "
bad,"Good pay of 12 to 15 per hour. Too many managers, too few team members on purpose, for stockholder value. Close at 1pm, but may work till 3 am aznd be back at 8 am."
bad,I don’t mind working hard and multi tasking but Target has changed al it over the years. If the managers don’t like u it doesn’t matter how hard u work they will still say u do a bad job and they expect way too much to get done in a small period of time
bad,Do not Work here. The HR team is rude to male employees And our managers also known as LOD’S Spend their time walking around the store looking for reshop and nothing else. Their expectations are unrealistic and they call you on the walkie like 100 times a day. There is no team effort whatsoever. They are critical and it might as well be high school all over again.
bad,This is a good place to work.  The overall management team at this company is good.  The people you work with on a regular basis on your various shifts are also fine.
bad,"They expect 10 year veterans to train temp workers so they can take their job.  Benefits used to be great, now you still pay the hefty premium but you also have a 5k deductible.  Management here is a joke, kids straight out of college who have zero work experience hired to lead up to 40 grown men who have been working hard their whole life.  Better make sure you don’t get sick or your kids don’t get sick, Target does not care about anything but more boxes.  I put in 10 years and took a 8/hr paycut to get out of there and recover my sanity."
bad,They hire management  that don't know what they doing.they hire people that don't want to work and a lot of gossip. The distance I have to drive is hard and the gas .
bad,"The favoritism is horrible, I asked for more hours multiple times and seen my weekly hours go down every time. They schedule people who aren't backroom in your place, leads talk about your personal life with other co workers, human resources does whatever works best for the other higher ups and really isn't there for your benefit."
bad,"Target is just a bad place to work. The managers are incompetent at best, will not accept time off even if it is for things mandatory such as school. They will also be upset when you call In because of the very things they wouldn't give you time off for. They have no idea how to manage"
bad,"This company don't know how to keep good and employees and is always in the hiring and firing stage. Pay and culture does not exist. Managers are not Managers, they are college grads with no sense and a dislike of their outcome."
bad,Don’t work here unless part time.  Hard wok no pay no raises. Most people stay for seasonal that’s it.  Plus I think it’s going out of business soon anyway.
bad,"If you're not prepared to ask people at least three times if they want to sign up for a Redcard, this job is not for you. It's all they seem to care about and it makes working there really unpleasant unless you are good at getting people to sign up for things they neither need nor want. The management has gone downhill and is almost militant. You will not advance unless you do a LOT of butt (they won't let me use the actual word here because it's ""inappropriate"") kissing and get a lot of Redcards, even if you are the best person for the position. I would not recommend this to anyone who isn't a teen looking for a little extra cash."
bad,"I worked in the mobile section, it was always back talking. The manager I had would always create group texts and would purposely leave people out just because she was back talking them, there would be separate group chats for different people, the district manager was also very rude and negative and stuck up. I would not recommend working there unless you like repeating high school with people older than you."
bad,"The vibe is dead, only the sales culture remains. Absolutely no over time and no hours unless it is a holiday.  Too much work to be accomplished and not enough time, employees and equipment."
bad,Too often do you find that those who contribute are asked to do more while those who do not put forth effort are asked to do the easiest of jobs just to get by. Essentially a lack of fairness in the work environment and no accountability. Pay and benefits are not existent while the ability to be promoted is limited. Do not expect to get 30+ hours as this is a rarity and normally is determined by your position.
bad,Managers are good but have to follow the “we don’t care about you or what you think program”. There is absolutely no flexibility unless it’s in Target’s favor.  The majority of the new hires are around 18 and they lack productivity and professionalism. This leads to experienced employees burning out because of the extra work load.
bad,"I started at target as a minor, I wasn't in school and was completely responisble for myself and my bills. If an ETL didn't like you, they'd cut your hours. Luckily, that ETL left, and my direct boss and his boss let me prove myself to them. To get hours I needed to work in other departments, but it was very difficult to find them sometimes. At orientation, they claim to care about you and your health, encouraging you to call out when you're sick, but I worked in food and they always made me feel bad for calling out even when I was in the ER. It took me a long time to qualify for benefits because they cut my hours and kept me right below where my average hours needed to be. The health insurance has a really high deductible, so I feel like its not even worth the stress and anxiety that comes with the job anymore. I transferred to another store and all the raises I had worked for were not applied to my pay, and I started at base pay. I thought this store was better at first but in the past year we've had 3 different HR ETLs and at least 3 different HR team leads, so forget trying to rectify any problems you have or building any sort of trust. The team leads and ETLs encourage you to cut corners and don't properly train anyone, and constantly change how they want you to do your job. A lot of the higher ups are rude and on a power trip, if you say anything your hours will get cut and they'll talk badly about you to your bosses and coworkers. If you kiss the right person's butt though, you'll get 40 hours a week even when others are getting 11 hours. I wish I was the only one that"
bad,"Working at target is probably the worst job I've ever had. The managers all gang up on you if you do one thing one manager doesn't like or doesn't agree with. 100% don not reccommend working at target, especially the one in Kalispell, MT."
bad,The management only looks at the business and does not care about/protect its employees. If an employee is in a sticky situation the company will elect to fire you to avoid the situation.
bad,"Target doesn't care about employee loyalty, total disregard for people with knowledge & experience that have been there working & hires college degreed kids, to supervise & they have no work experience...supervisors sleep on the job, do not represent their employees properly to upper management, they retaliate against employees who report safety violations or job place concerns-even though they encourage you to speak up."
bad,"I worked in market section of the store where we get a food truck everyday.  "
bad,Management is biased and unfair. They definitely have their favorites. You work your butt off while you watch people who have been there for years slack off and management is on you saying you're slow. Told me to put away items at 30 seconds per box while people who have been there forever didnt even do that. I will say I timed myself and I was at around 35 seconds a box but I'm slow. Ridiculous! Not fair and like I said very biased.....
bad,Target was a company with a very poor leader and a lot of inside fighting.    They couldn't get the company off the ground and they were not supportive of the Industry at all
bad,I liked being able to be home with my family and work part time. The benefits weren't the greatest. There were pretty flexible on scheduling which was nice.
bad,very poor management.manager never scheduled enough people. alot of favoritism.other then that the co workers were helpful and nice.even the co worker agreed there was poor managment
bad,Horrible environment to work in. Managers are two faced and rules are bent for favorites. Drama around every corner and team leads that love to pick favorites. Steritech violations consistently made knowingly.
bad,Shot hole of a job working  you get treated like dirt if you're not in the.  In Crowd you break your back people steal credit for work you did you're lucky if you get more than 12 hours a week
bad,"Physical, Labor intensive. Management unfair. Gossiping culture. Not getting enough hours was the hardest part. And getting the attention of Upper Mgmt. to enforce behaviors. Professionalism was non-existent. Overworked and underpaid. Nepotism was encouraged.Most enjoyable part of the job was finishing my job in record time."
bad,"you come in unload a truck "
bad,"Logistics (Flow) very angry, stressfull place to work.  Co-workers are shocking rude and unpleasant to one another.   Forced to work more that 8 hours per day but ABSOLUTELY NO OVERTIME, based on 40 hours per week."
bad,"-Upper management ignores the needs of Starbucks and takes advantage of low-level employees"
bad,"Literally the worst place ever. I hated every second I was there. For the things that Target wants you to do, they don't pay nearly enough. The management is very cliquey and gives certain people special treatment."
bad,"It's a minimum-wage job. It's definitely treated like one. You must work as hard as possible and push whatever they want you to while also maintaining your sanity. However, expect no help in this. They will routinely leave you understaffed in any department and expect that the slack be picked up in a manner befitting a superhero. (No, really, I think they might expect you to be one. Of course, you aren't saving the world with your powers; you're saving Target's bottom line.)"
bad,I did not enjoy my time with target. the pay was low . they kept me at part-time and I felt very used as an employee. I did not feel like they valued my work
bad,"Having to stay inside the ""boat"" and ring up customers. "
bad,"So, I have worked with many people at this location. Some were very pleasant. I think the management lacks much integrity when it comes to the rest of the team members. They treat the team members like they are much less of a people. The respect level is not there. I was even told by the Human Resources that I need to answer any team lead in a positively and friendly tone even if they gave me a rude and aggressive tone."
bad,Target was a terrible place to work. The management constantly micromanages and does not promote individuality in their employees. If there is an employee that they do not like they go out of their way to find reasons to coach that employee until they either quite or they have grounds to fire them. There are unrealistic expectations around performance for many of the team leads and the overall direction of the company is customer-centric and disregards the employee completely. The pay is terrible as well and is not competitive at all.
bad,"Cliques run the store.  Management is too uppity to talk to anyone lower than them.  Poor communication throughout.  I would never advise my worst enemy to work here.  Abusive and physical threats are tolerated by management even though they say that it has  zero tolerance for violence, those who report it are deemed non-compliant and ignored.  Those who do it are put on a pedestal and their cliques are rewarded."
bad,They don't know what they doing they just sit in they office and complain and complain but they don't help They b doing shady stuff behind close doors and there is a man named Theo He thinks he can talk to you anyway he feels wrong
bad,if your in school and just need some money its fine to work there. they do favoritism so dont expect to advance if you arent kissing you know what its notabot how long you have worked thereand howgood you do your jog.
bad,Stocking and customer service. Doing a little bit of everything in the store. The hardest part was the management because they cared very little about their employees.
bad,"Culture at this company is like a cult.  If you are not ""bought in"" to the corporate fluff and b.s. you are immediately labeled as a problem employee and they try to send you to re-education camp.  People the are ""bought-in"" to this company are target robots.  Not a heatly place to work."
bad,Management was abysmal at communicating effectively and were clearly not well trained for the job. The particular location I worked at had a shortage of workers the entire time because the location supposedly was not generating enough profit. This led to a very high paced and stressed environment where no one came close to achieving goals as set by upper management.
bad,associates were very helpfull managers were more worried about production than you're health as a seasonal they really dont care about you they just want to use you for the holidays and dispose of you
bad,"Reprimand's by management are inconsistent across the board. If you don't play office politics you will be branded as being negative & eventually let go. Management and HR never take responsibility for their mistakes. It's always someone else's fault. "
bad,This place is not for people who have a family and real life bills the pay is no good the biggest check i every had for working two weeks is $550.78 after that it was getting less and less. They lie to you in the interview about the red card and tell you its not mandatory but than harsh you about getting people to get the card and than try to force the customer to get it .. the only thing i enjoyed was the customers and my co-works they was helpful.. You work hours on hours to get a little check
bad,"not a place i would recommended, pay isnt worth all the work they put on you. come home worn out , they over work the workers not a god job for some people"
bad,"I had my Target on Apalachee parkway in Tallahassee Fl investigated for a hostile work environment and retaliation after i was fired for speaking up to the ""integrity""hotline. after calling i was dismissed from my job for helping a customer before i clocked in for the day. Mind you my title was Guest services Team leader. but i was fired for putting cat litter into a handicapped customers cart. that was my final offense"
bad,"This job is just for individuals starting out in the work force. You can move up to management, but at the sacrifice of your dignity and self-worth. Hours are unknown per each month, and favoritism is the name of the game here."
bad,It a great company to work for if you are in the right location. The store I was at was a bad place to work management suck. They are all for them self and always back stabbing each other and there team members. I enjoyed meeting new people and helping them with whatever they needed help with and my team when they needed my help.
bad,"I wouldn't reccomond it at all, management does nothing and lie to you.They get on to you infront of customers, lie to you about policy, and do not retract anything they say"
bad,"TARGET RECYCLING  not the store target."
bad,"Started out as a fun and friendly place to work but then managers don't pull there own weight and do there job.  Then when they see you, they act like there important."
bad,"Target was a great place to work but times have changed and it's not what it used to be sadly...  walk away.  Promotions here are not based on your abilities but if you're part of the click.  Working yourself into the ground for $50,000 is no fun for you or your family."
bad,"Yes, Target is everyones favorite, but working for them wasn't the best. They were way too concerned with corporate procedure that didn't really allow you to interact with guests on a personal level"
bad,target was not a good place for me and I do not recommend it for anyone to work there . some of the people are okay and then some of them are very prejudice.
bad,"I absolutely did not enjoy going to work. The managers were mean and snotty. The pay was decent ($10/hr), but compared to the work we were doing we deserved more. Their scheduling sucks. I would take off days and they would say I have it off then they would call me that day and say I had a no call no show. Terrible place. And talk about lousy discounts! 10% is nothing."
bad,I would never work for the again. they did not treat their employees right at all there was a lot of favoritism going with the employees and managers that was not okay
bad,"very poor culture and treatment of employees by management. Many health code and OSHA violations at every store with little regard by management other than putting enough band aids on the issue to ""pass"" a store visit from a senior manager."
bad,"Management likes to promise advancement into managerial roles, it will never happen. They are extremely unfair and not at all sensitive to employee needs."
bad,"The managers are hard on you"
bad,"The Inbound receiving manager used personal feelings towards employees whether it was favoritism or dislike to get people fired and/or make the job easier on some people. Good pay for a warehouse job, but the company could do so much better with better managers."
bad,Management is awful and raises are very small and some employes haven't had a raise in over 5 years. They are more concerned about numbers. They very rarely praise the employees. The have an A team and the rest of the team members feel as if it gets rubbed in their faces daily.
bad,"Management was straight outta college with no life experience, no work experience, always making questionable decisions with no regard for how it impacts the team."
bad,"I like all my coworkers and most the managers were ok. They severely understaff the store(even during the weekends when it's busiest) and expect you to an almost insurmountable amount work (although work load does vary by department). Most of the time I would be the only person for the electronics department, toys department, seasonal department, and baby department(and yes, I would have to cover all those departments have them all cleaned, returned products restocked, help customers, answer phone calls for these four different departments with no help at all). But hey if you're in desperate need of a job and have the availability Target will give you a decent amount of hours"
bad,"The biggest issues are the changes that the company has gone through. It used to be a great place to work, friendly environment.  You were recognized for the work you complete.  It has turned into a hostile environment  which discriminates against long term employees.  The management is now mostly millennials that are unable to relate and communicate with their peers . The expectations have become unrealistic. which is causing a horrible turn over rate .  I strongly recommend seeking employment at another retailer"
bad,"If you want to be treated like dirt and want to get fired for going to the doctor to many times even when you have doctors notes, then  you want to work here....NOT!"
bad,they only give you enough time to barely get your work done but expect you to do the work of 3 people. with constant threats of corrective actions and write ups for not doing so.
bad,"Focused on operations more than customer service."
bad,target has a bunch of drama. and the managment does not care at all. They all act like theyre better than you and dont care about your problems. I cant stand how they just act like they are way above you. after a while it wears on your feelings and confidence.
bad,"I worked here for 10 year, 6 full time years and 4 part time years. The management of this company is very poor and lazy. Bad employees are never held accountable for poor performance and the good employees get all the work load put on them. The pay is less than any competitor and raises are very low."
bad,"A typical day comes in, start your work, get hassled constantly by management, go to the huddle, and finish your work.  "
bad,"The distribution center is just another stereotypical workplace that heavy relies on dispensable seasonal workers. Being a Packer is an extremely monotonous and repetitive that involves putting boxes into other boxes for 10 or 12 painstakingly long hours in a small work station. Overall, it wasn't a bad gig for the three months I've worked here. As a packer, you're expected to hit a specific quota of scans in a night, but some nights can be horrific since it's completely arbitrary as to what products will be on a cart that you'll have to pack. To make things worse, the higher authoritative figures decided it was in everyone's best interest to raise the quota for each work station even higher, which could easily transmute as one hour of extra work that cannot be accomplished in a normal work shift. There is no absolute guarantee of seasonal workers becoming permanent workers, in most circumstances, I've heard and witnessed, this distribution center likes to layoff seasonals and call them back almost two months later for a permanent job offer. The only thing I appreciated from working in this grim place was one extremely charismatic, empathetic and intelligent Operations Manager that was in charge of me, arguably the coolest manager I've ever had; everyone else was easily forgettable."
bad,One of the worst places to work never work here management is terrible hours are terrible they demand too much and never appreciate. They don't care about what you have to say.
bad,"I do not at all miss target, they had horrible management, a raise depended on how much the manager liked you not on your work ethic.  I got a raise but only because I would sit and listen to my manager vent about her relationship struggles.  Terminations also were very unprofessional and shady."
bad,Target is going through too many changes. You don't know from day to day what is going to change in your role. Increased workload/ decreased hours. Management is not on same page and communication is obsolete.
bad,"horrible culture. Lots of discrimination in the workplace, favoritism and groupies. A lot of talking behind people's back. People are not trained properly and there is a lot of information been thrown at you"
bad,"I've worked for target for over 3yrs, sadly the title says it all! I've never worked anywhere where they hold you to such high expectations and without a seconds notice you're being shown the door. New Management seems more concerned about sales than staffing, causing more work loads per single person! Major tun-over ratio!"
bad,"one of the worst retail companies I have worked for. Long overnight hours, Store leadership treated you like dogs. Pay was horrible, sometimes didn't let you leave until the job was finished. While all the morning ETL,s drank coffee"
bad,Bad managment. They will lie cheat and steal to get more out of you. Being a corporate pawn is not a good thing. I hope to never work for this company again .
bad,"Really not people friendly, training well what training! Just want results from day 1, no help what so ever from management, The salary is not bad but trying to a big company but haven't quiet got there yet."
bad,"A typical work day includes"
bad,"the management gossips and talks bad about employees behind their back, target also mishandled a groping assault case involving myself and made me cry in doing so, overall very poorly run for such a big company. the workplace environment is terrible, the management is terrible, the treatment is terrible, the compensation is terrible; to sum it all up i felt very unappreciated and taken advantage of. it is also worth noting that after my groping assault case they began scheduling me terrible (outside of availability, 9 days straight or just not at all)."
bad,"In my time working for Target, I had many notable experiences. I often found that my availability needs were not met even though I was reassured that this would not be a problem when I was hired. I also had several issues when reaching out to the management for guidance. I often found that when I was in need of help, the superiors were not there to lend a hand. I always felt as though the management staff did not appreciate the hard work that the team members put into the job. The job was often rewarding in the sense of constantly being able to interact with new people and being surrounded by positive team members. While I did meet many wonderful people at Target, my time there was unsatisfactory."
bad,Terrible company. Look out for people they like and not the ones who deserve the job! Seniority doesn't exist even if you over qualify someone else. They go with who they are friends with. Management is terrible. No communication!
bad,"I've been working for Target for a little over 2 and 1/2 years now and for the majority of the time, I've been working in the Target Cafe area of the store. Target Cafe is often cast aside/not cared about at all by the Executive Team Leads of the store. I constantly ask for my breaks to be covered and since their is no one cross trained in the Cafe at my store, I often have to shut down and go on my breaks."
bad,"Target was a grueling place to work.  Management was constantly on  your back, nothing was every good enough or fast enough.  You were treated like a moron who could not be trusted to do their job.  This company is so afraid of a law suit they train their management people to be on you about trivial things like pushing a cart of items vs pulling and you were reprimanded on the sales floor if you didn't comply.  The daily huddle was a waste of time that could be better spent completing our assignments instead of being required to participate in a juvenile cheer at each huddle.  Fortunately my co-workers made it bearable to come to work as we all commiserated about how much we felt degraded in this company.  "
bad,"You're lucky to get any hours unless you sign people up for a credit card everyday, and people get fired all the time and nobody will tell us why. They just disappear overnight."
bad,South Main Target is trash.... I would never work there again. The managers are crazy and all they do is give there work to those under them.  There is so much drama in that story.  They talk behind your back and if you're not talking about someone they don't like you.
bad,Do not work at Target in J-Town. Management is horrible! Treat their employees terribly. Don't follow set availability. Not a good environment at all.
bad,I don't know too much about Target. I only did an intership here. I did not inter act with too many people while I was there. It is retail so I don't have much to say about it.
bad,"You don't get paid enough for all the work they expect out of you. I was a single person expected to keep all the bathrooms cleaned, all the shopping carts brought in, and run a register."
bad,"If you're open to spending your entire life working here with little to no days off, work here. Because Management doesn't care about your personal life or your well being. While working there I endured 2 horrific moments I had personally away from work. Management didn't care. They never said sorry for me, never had any compassion or consideration. They just got rid of me as fast as they could. I worked so many hours a week with minimum pay. I worked so hard I would go home sore and uncomfortable each day. My weekly schedule was different each week, and different hours each day. I worked on the floor, constantly moving, and always going up for backup at cashier when called. My coworkers usually never went up since they like to make the ""new"" ones go for them. I only liked working with 4 of the 15 or so people I worked with in my department daily. One woman I worked near 3 different shifts, constantly talked terribly about customers and other employees right to me. She judged everyone and everything, and accused people of things they ""did"" to other employees. I spoke to management about this, and they simply told me ""she's an old, tired woman who's been working here forever. You can't take what she says seriously."" I just had no words. Some co-workers there thought they were all that and a bag of chips. Like they ran the place. It's just Target. If you're shy, seriously don't even think about this place. You're around human contact all day, and you see hundreds of people. While working cashier I always felt like I had to rush or I wasn't good enough, almost always making me"
bad,"All my shifts at target made me second guess what i was doing. Only real skills i learned at target was knowing how to use a cash register, i think being a cashier was the best part about working there. All the gstls' and gsas' were extremely nice, anybody who worked the front of the store was very kind and nice. The supervisors for the sales floor were terrible. Only 2 supervisors out of about 10 were nice to me and answered any questions i asked and helped me when needed. All of the other supervisors treated me like dirt. I walked into the TSC office multiple times to hear supervisors talking about me in an inappropriate matter and throwing slander on my name. Also they like to stand in front of the store mid-day and at night by guest services and not only speaking badly about the employees but the customers as well. Only way i will ever go back to working at target is if i can be a cashier only."
bad,The managers wasn't very professional. Nobody was ever on the same page. Get in trouble for doing what one manager say is okay. They targeted mostly blacks coming into the store. NO HOURS just terrible place to work
bad,There is no communication and they don's take your personal life into consideration with certain decisions. It is not a job that I would stay at for a long period of time.
bad,Management constantly makes poor decisions when handling talent. Too many workers in the wrong positions lead to poor results. HR never focuses on worker accountability.
bad,I loved it until I realized higher up executives are bullies and if you mess up they will never let you live it down.  I dealt with the chaos of their high expectations with low or no recognition. There were few people in management I trusted to talk to about my concerns. Only with my direct coworkers did I feel like a team we had each others back even when management did not.
bad,"Too many cons to list for this location.  The management team at this location is very tight knit and they ""watch each others backs"".  Although I was management hired in for fast track promotion they failed to follow through.  It seemed they said what they said to get the position filled. Their turnover rate at this location is high due to the fact once hired in you realize it is not what they said.  They have a very old way of management.  Their management team is young and poorly trained/educated in proper management and it shows. There is always issues at any work place but please understand that this location is worst than most."
bad,"Very immature work environment , lack of discipline.  Favoritism is played in the work place. Very unprofessional. Hires anyone with 2arms and 2 legs and no common sense. Only looks out for the company's interest not the employees."
bad,I enjoyed working at target.......It was perfect hours I enjoyed.......just alot of ups n downs......they are pretty linenant with things as well.....
bad,Team leaders are very good at what they do but the executive leader are just lazy and like to talk about employs behind there backs. the only one who is professional is the store manager.
bad,"The Missouri City location's management is awful! Its a very unprofessional environment! Your mortality is constantly tested, and you'll find yourself in uneasy circumstances. They will drain you of your good energy!"
bad,"A typical day at the Bend, Oregon Store would consist of constantly trying to get my employees in the building and to their assigned positions on time and there is a lot of back stabbing and gossip that goes on behind the scenes and the management is a real piece of work. They sent me to training not even a week into my job and just kept throwing things at me at a break neck speed that I had no time to try to memorize and get the hang of the job. They just assume that you know how to do it all and be a one man band and that is not the case. I WILL NEVER WORK FOR THESE JERKS AGAIN"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone working here unless you want it to be your life. There is no loyalty and upper management is full of themselves. They don't care about their employees even though they say they do. You will constantly work hard only for upper management to conduct ""visits"" which consists of more criticizing than it does teaching. You could work for the company for years and be successful and if one bad boss doesn't like you they will set you up to fail so they can fire you. This company cares about nothing but sales and red cards and could care less that you exist. As a salaried manager they expect you to work way past your scheduled hours and can call you or text you anytime and expect you to show up. There is no work life balance and they could care less about your well being. Don't let them fool when they preach well being. I don't recommend anyone in any position working for this company."
bad,"The only upside to working here are the fellow team members, who are trying to make an honest living as well. Nothing more, nothing less. Management has been terrible: unorganized in terms of hourly distribution, lack of suitable amount of members in each department daily, leading to other people from other departments having to do other people's work, hindering them from getting their own work done, leading to a cycle of seemingly impossible objectives not being met, which is a problem, as micromanagement from supervisors are a part of the job culture."
bad,"I worked as a seasonal packer here. The job itself required no thought process but lots of energy. Even if you received ""bad freight"", you were still expected to ""make prod"". The prod numbers in most zones were almost impossible to make, even if you hauled butt all night. The trainer was the least helpful person ever. I survived purely for the fact that I had previous experience working in a distribution. The operations managers are only there to tell you if you managed to save the company money or you cost them money. That's what it all comes down to: money. They preach safety, but they could not care less. My husbandworks in Inbound and he is constantly working ""team lift"" trailers by himself. He has been injured a handful of times and refuses to report for fear of losing his job. The starting wage on the B2 shift is 11.50, and it's not worth it. I do not recommend this job for anybody. Human beings are worth more than this."
bad,"This is the worse retailer to work for.  You will meet lots of real nice people, your team members.  However, the company pays peanuts, doesn't support the culture  with the proper amount of hours to run the business properly.  Forget getting help out of any Etl's .  Most are brought fresh out of college, with little to no work experience nor work ethic. Expectations for a $12/ hr team lead is equivalent to what companies paying 50k would expect."
bad,"I was in a minimum wage position, so maybe it's different higherr up the chain. Target is a terrible place to work, liken it to slave labor. The management is terrible, no logic to decisions made. There is little to no advancement opportunity. And if you are injured on the job, God help you, because they will fight with everything they have to avoid treating and compensating any employee injured on the job."
bad,Target to me is a joke. They are immature and dont really know how to handle situations well because in the long run all they think about is how are they going to look rather then thinking of their employees.
bad,"Management has become a game of musical chairs. New management usually has no concept of how to operate the store or lead the team. New hires are becoming increasingly useless due to miserable HR. Scheduling is weak, cutting hours on busy weekends/holidays."
bad,"Hours are irregular, and it is unlikely to get full time hours. They claim they help out college students, but that's more on paper then in person. they mostly higher supervisors of all levels from other stores so advancement in your location is also unlikely. money is not worth stress."
bad,Developing with your co-workers is great until you realize there is nothing else to learn and grow there (well unless you like to kiss feet) and that most managers are incompetent and demoralizing to their subordinates.
bad,"There are a lot of us apolitical employees in my store that have just had it with the CEO and their bunch making decisions based on their political beliefs that create a terribly uncomfortable situation with our guests. I can't do anything, but I get flack from the guests for the actions of the corporate office. I have been a loyal team member throughout the past 7 years, but I can't get passed this latest ploy the company has decided to force us team member to deal with the public with no way to defend the decisions of corporate. I 'm sorry to leave my teammates, but I have no choice."
bad,It starts off good but the bosses expect too much and dont even bother to help. Most the ETLs stand around telling people what to do and dont see them help pushing cafs. Expectations are too high and the compenstation is too low. THey also keep scheduling against my availiability even though ive told them hundreds of times i cant work and end up having to call out or switch shift last minute.
bad,Good place to work only for Senior Leadership and not regular employees. All the tantrum makers and political leaders can survive in this company.
bad,If you are not a favorite of managers and team leads you are treated like a no body and given no hours.  The more money you make the less hours you are given.
bad,"I enjoyed the type of work I was doing for this company and my customers, but I wasn't paid properly and was well over worked."
bad,A very physically demanding high work environment. A lot is asked from you in a little bit of time. Most enjoyable part of the day was leaving work and the hardest part of the day was when the store was very busy.
bad,"I can only speak for the Enfield CT store in this review but I had such a bad experience I will not work for the Target Corporation again. THe executive management was incompetent and my direct boss ( ETL Logistics) had no moral, legal or ethical boundaries.  I would be asked to do things that were against my ethical limits.  When I moved away I gave a month's notice of my move and trained my replacement.  I requested transfer options (for financial security reasons, I didn't have a job to move to) but didn't receive information until a week before I moved.  The only option they presented me was a demotion and I rejected that offer.  They then tried to mark me as a bad termination because I ""didn't leave two weeks notice for leaving the company"".  Again this review is based only on my experience in the Enfield CT store but I was treated so poorly that I will not work for another Target Store again."
bad,"you need to be super fast for them but not good for them. you can do all the dirty work that no body want to do but they can fusse about it."
bad,"They seem great at first, but the longer you are there, the worse things get.  I feel like they try to make you feel trapped and then try to see how poorly you will accept being treated"
bad,"a typical day consisted of unloading the truck and stocking the floor. I really didn't learn much that I already didn't know. Management could have been better. My co-workers for the most part were good, hard workers. The hardest part of my job was dealing with my Team Lead and her condescending attitude plus constant power trips. The most enjoyable part of my job was....."
bad,"a typical day at work was worrying about shop lifters and if there was gonna be a fight in the store."
bad,"I worked for Target Starbucks. And what I had thought was Starbucks was its on corporation, but no the Starbucks inside target was owned by target and under target license. You don't get the same benefits and definitely not the same pay as a Starbucks corporation would. They fire you if you make your own drink even if it is one time without no write up or warning and its not in your contract either. I felt that the target in Clovis, CA was very discriminatory. Some of the management especially the HR was unprofessional."
bad,Most of the people at this particular location are really nice.  The expectations from corporate are a little out of reach for the most of us.
bad,"A typical day at work is always pretty stressful ,its never really organized . There is never any coverage or a extending hand that can really help you. Now on the good side we do have an awesome store manager but as far as the rest of the staff goes its always a lack of communication. I've learned that i can honestly be good a any task that is put in  front of me. My coworkers are cool i work well with all my coworkers ,some people slack on their work but mostly as a team there is never any issues. The hardest part is dealing with guest with no support and knowing their is never anyone who can help you with a line.The most enjoyable part of my job is helping a guest and making them smile ."
bad,"Target culture is non existant. Open door policy is false and misleading. Employees are told the no retaliation of any kind would occur. This is a lie. be very careful trusting any management leaders."
bad,"I was a sft now called pmt  for almost 6 yrs. Target is not the company it used to be. If you need a job take it but keep looking. This Co is a sinking ship.target declared bankruptcy just to make payroll two years ago. Sold their red card 5 yrs ago. Just sold the pharmacy to cvs. Pmt currently gets 40 hrs a week. That is the only plus. I doubt that will continue next year. Derrick Jones, your district  manager, look for no support, you will be the sacrificial lamb to save their own butt. You will find out that many many people have come and go. I kept hoping they would get it together but unfortunately  they keep finding more ways to keep screwing up. I still know alot of people that still work there but they are miserable and looking elsewhere. Alot of very good people that have,been with the company  for years have left."
bad,"Working for Target Mobile, I was never part of the team. I had electronic associates come up and tell me my job was to just sell cellphones. In reality, all thanks to the commission structure, I made money off any accessory for a sell phone under $80 and anything in the electronic department over $80 with the purchase of a prepaid. "
bad,"When I first started there I was excited about my future with Target. Overtime I realized that even with a degree in Business I would not be going anywhere. In fact when I started asking around about promotions I was given the run around. Eventually I began to look for jobs elsewhere. I made it clear that I still wanted to further my career at Target if possible but nothing happened until I was terminated on bogus accusations. Their were some great people that worked at that store but it was clear that management had an agenda and it certainly didn't involve me. I made mistakes that at worst could have involved a write up. I had a clean record at that store and worked there for over a year. When I was terminated I was treated like a criminal shown pictures of what I did wrong. I asked why didn't anyone tell me that I was messing up? They said they needed to create a case about me. If I was just told not to do what I was doing I would have corrected my mistakes, instead I was treated like a thief and let go."
bad,"Daily work consist of stocking shelves, pulling and stocking stockroom. A lot of mindless work, nothing challenging. Nothing difficult to learn."
bad,I was terminated for not applying coupons and discounts when that was our job. Communication is very bad. I was a cashier and the only communication we had with everyone was a phone. everyone else had walkie-talkies. I was trying to call my manager because someone was stealing a shirt and they came like 20 mins later. They need a soft padding for cashiers to stand on. Gift Cards promotions need to be detailed more or at least made a little more specific and able to read. The schedule was the worst. One day they would have me closing (1am) and expect me back in the next day at 8am.
bad,Management is right out of college in fields that have nothing to do with the job. work by numbers and if they don't got enough work for the employees its the employees fault.No accountability for managments actions.
bad,My typical day would be counting inventory. helping many guests. Getting my job done in a timely manner. I've been an employee at Target for 8 years.
bad,"Not a great place to work if you value your soul. Big corporation - hard to advance, revolving managers, too many layers of approval to accomplish much. No great for someone who just wants to get stuff done."
bad,"the management didn't know what they where doing, they where filled with empty promises that made the team hate working. "
bad,"Worse place I have ever worked for, managers are terrible and they have there heads so far up there butts they can't think straight, have the managers there just sit at there desk and expect everyone to work for them. There discount will only work with gift card, cash or the ""red card"""
bad,"boring job, mean employees no benefits, mean superiors bossy employees, low pay, I hated working for this company and would never work for them again"
bad,"I decided to try for a PT position at Target when we needed the money when I wasn't bringing in enough cash with my small business. Since I loved Target and was there most days I decided to apply as it was only 2 miles away from my home and afforded me the ability to keep my business and work PT. Unfortunately, working here was an unpleasant experience. Damaged products were encouraged to be placed out onto the shelves as the less stock sent to the back, the better. Same went with outdated merchandise: we never got a chance to check or properly move the old stock to the front and new to the back as it would require more time than allocated in the budget so we were ""PUSHED"" to get to the next row of boxes or section or area. If items were left without sensors, broken, in wrong places and you as an employee wanted to take pride in your space or store to make it look nicer, you were reprimanded and put on disciplinary action for acting out of line and could be terminated for doing so. During orientation they show a DVD in which portions are fast forwarded as to hide information from staff. It was during this time that they never showed me that you as an employee are required to used a Target standard box cutter and if you bring in an ergonomic box cutter that will clip on your belt to not fall off (which happens constantly and people get written up for and the store gets fined for) you can get terminated for. Started out in soft lines where you are taught to ""flex"" merchandise so when I was moved to other portions of the store I was never told not to stop and this was only for"
bad,"Work included doing pulls until 6pm, then zoning an area, then reshop (at times during the day). Add to this helping guests with their concerns. In between team members had to act as back-up cashiers when lines got long. Breaks consist of one 15 minute break, a 30 minute lunch and another 15. Depending on how many hours you work in a day, you get all three. For example, if one works 4-5 hours, they only get a 15. 6 or more, a 30 is given with another 15."
bad,"i learned how hard i can work here, the do push y ou really hard here and sometimes it works well, and sometimes it doesnt. they managemnt also picks favorites."
bad,"I hated the job"
bad,"Target was a victim of bad press.  Although this press was created by Target opening with great fan fare, and failing to deliver on expectations.  Once they did finally deliver on what the consumers wanted, the press was not ready to forgive them and deliver them  fair treatment.  This ensured them an inability to climb out of the hole they dug for themselves."
bad,"as a part time worker they didn't treat you like you were part of the team,  they didn't want to give you the hours because they didn't want to give you any benifits."
bad,"It depends on what my role for the day is as to what a typical workday is... If I am at Guest Services: I may be there a couple of hours or until a cashier that is trained can take over so that I can take over for the GSTL so that they can get certain projects done or go back and sit and play on the computer. If I am scheduled to be GSA then 9 times out of 10 I do not have anyone that can cover for me to get certain things done and I get reprimanded for them not getting done even when it wasn't my responsibility. I may close down the registers at night and put the till in for the next day with the exception of a few or I may open up the next day and bank the few registers that was not done the night before. Usually when I closed down I would get out of Target at about 11:30pm but would have to wait on who ever the closing LOD was and it may be 11:45pm or 12:00am before I got to leave and would have to be back at 7:30 am the next morning. Most of the time I did not even get my last 15 minute break that is required by law."
bad,"Slave labor, they micro-managed you to death, they treat you like your stupid, they are very discriminating, if your not in really good shape they try to get rid of you, all they care about are production numbers yet they will try to get rid of you if you get hurt, they typically hire young kids out of college to be group leaders with no real work experience or life experience, so they can brain wash them with their slogan (Best Company Ever) and (Be You, Be Target) videos for team members as well. It's very male dominated and they typically put the women in Packing because they don't think the women can handle the other departments where a really strong back is needed. There are a lot of guys that form clicks and like to compete with other clicks in a very critical manner. The pay is good, but everything else is bad, like the health insurance, $4,500 dollar deductibles, 70/30 coverage, ect."
bad,"As someone who has been involved in the industry for close to 10 years Target is one of the worst for most things. No opportunities for advancement, Not the best of benefits, NO communication with corporate ever (even if you try) no doubt the lowest paying job I've ever had in my life AND I was one of the managers ;p"
bad,"I would not recommend my worst enemy to work here. They are very unprofessional. For example, When I showed up to interview, no one was even aware I had one. Then it took over an hour to find someone willing to do it. I should have walked out right then in there but I didn't, so that's my fault. I accepted the job and was told that they would send me the date/time for orientation. I was sent 2 different times to show up. I decided to just go with the earlier time(good thing I did because that was the correct one). I was supposed to receive 40 hours of training (Starbucks rule) and I only received 16 before I was put on my own. After about a month I quickly realized that unless  you are some sort of management (TL, ETL, STL, GSA/GSTL) they will treat you like dirt. On a daily basis, multiple managers will tell you to do a million different things and they will expect you to have them all done at the same time, while they go sit in the office and chat about their weekends. They could not care any less about you getting your break or not. When approached about any issue whatsoever they will push it off, guaranteed. They will pull you out of your department to help another and then later ask why your department looks so bad. They'll mess up your schedule on purpose, they won't help you get your shift covered, and they will give you a very hard time if you ever call off, no matter the reason. Do yourself a favor, do not apply."
bad,"Pros - Allowed to use 10% discount with coupons, Bus pass program, discounts at the Starbucks location in the store."
bad,"I started working at Target in high school and stayed through the majority of college, simply because I needed a job that wasn't going to be too demanding with a full time school schedule.  I worked there for five years and never made it out of the $7 bracket, even though I always had amazing performance reviews.  Nepotism was rampant at my store, with people getting their kids hired on and making more money starting out than people who had been there for years.  The management ranged from extremely careless to wildly egotistical.  Human resources was the worst; you'd go to them with a problem and they would literally laugh in your face.  If you can help it, do NOT work here."
bad,Management is very demanding and not easy to work with. Human resources is very sexist and bigoted even though they put on a very friendly façade. Requested off Sundays for religious reasons denied request. Teenage high school supervisors are power-mad and take advantage of their position. Early morning unloading shift is over worked and workers in the trailer are not swapped out during the hot summer desert mornings. This is Arizona people! It gets hot as an oven in trailers and management expect only two people to handle and unload the entire truck shipment without rotation.
bad,They is a very poor store moral. The employees do not trust the management because they don't feel appreciated. The job turn around is hirer than any other retailer. Managers and HR staff are very unprofessional. The are several ties when management really doesn't know what's going on I the store and why thing are the way that they are. Employees are not able to express their personal concerns to management with getting retaliation or felling back lash from it. Promotions are given based on popularity not skills.
bad,"they talk about culture, team, oppurtunities but its a joke."
bad,"Working at Target was a very busy, fast pace environment.  I worked directly with General Managers, Department Managers and Supervisors.  My position was in the maintenance department.  I worked with mechanics and utility attendants too.  I ordered supplies, maintained all maintenance accounts and kept up with several computer programs specifically for the Target organization."
bad,"Management was awful. Manager acted as if this was  was the best job in the world, and also acted like the job was a god send from heaven. when getting hired they don't tell you that you will be working both Starbucks and target cashier, (mostly target cashier), when working on the target floor they forced you to sell there target cards and watch you do it and if they didn't like the way you pitched it they would let you know infront of everyone. Starbucks manager is an ....... , with short people syndrome, because he's always angry about something, you basically get paid little money for all the hard work that you do. I have worked at other Starbucks and I  never have done as much unnecessary work as I do here. best advice don't work at this target."
bad,"This a horrible company. Target only cares about making their money back that they lost. They do not care about staffing, staff wellbeing, culture at all. Whatever they say at the interview you will soon come to realize it's all a lie. I worked there since day 1 and it started out really great and slowly got worse and worse. There are other jobs that pay just as little at target so please if you are a decent worker don't do it."
bad,"Stocking fridges, filling lotto ticket trays, sweep, mop, fill fluids at gas pumps, organize, serve customers."
bad,"In my personal experience the management team like to ask to team members to push sales, trying to sell attachments with core items they can not guarantee my 15 minutes break and my lunch on time. I tried to follow up and call in for my break and lunch when I started working for greenfield target, soon I realized this is very annoying. I might have to call a few times to get a respond from lead on duty for my 15 minutes break or lunch. Some team members come over to cover my break and lunch had to drop their work, they are not happy about it. I have to deal with the attitude for what I deserve. This is ridiculous. I decided to only call in for lunch and giving up my 15 minutes break after one month or so. I ended up going home extremely tired everyday but compare with dealing potential drama and ugly looking face I am happy. "
bad,"unloading a truck pushing items to the floor"
bad,I was a cashier. Manag ement team was terrible and. Very rude and always wanted me top push red cards! Fir st off I was  hired for cashier which wasnt what I wanted and they made me push red cards!! Hated it ! If I wanted to be in sales I would have applied for a sales position somewhere elae. Management very rude and u put y our light o n and they dont come!! Horrible store in deerfield super target! Stay away from that one!!never went by mt availablity eit her!
bad,"Target management is poor - very young and inexperienced. Company also does not care about employees in the least. Management advances by who they like and not by credentials "
bad,"Target Canada, Needs improvement from headquarters on how the leadership team treats there employees and help make work more manageable outside of work."
bad,"From working at 2 different Target stores, management is horrible at every store!!"
bad,"Identified and reported merchandise or stock shortages.  Worked with local law enforcement as needed.  Implemented and recommended processes to reduce property and financial losses."
bad,"This is the worst working environment I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. During the two months of seasonal employment that I spent with this outfit, two separate people rage-quit, walking right off the job. I was tempted to do the same. Target is disingenuous, commanding that customers be referred to as 'guests' while simultaneously demanding that we extract more money from them. Pay was just barely above minimum, but sparse hours negated that and then some. Store leadership is opaque and management is highly computerized, making even small malfunctions into colossal disruptions of store functioning."
bad,They push the red car but when you get a good review they dont acknowledge you
bad,Enjoyed this job. Did not like the way management handled situations. Not very friendly.
bad,"Been working for Target for almost 6 months now, and I am not impressed. They have been gradually cutting my hours ever since I started there. How do they expect someone to live on 10.5 hours per week? I am not a student and I have bills to pay. As a part time employee you should be getting 24+ hours per week. Good luck getting that. They hire way too many people and then cut hours right off the bat. They keep it up they won't last long in Canada. "
bad,Too many people playing by their own rules makes the game difficult to play.
bad,"as security I was an over glorified greater. I got the impression that between corporate and regional security management nobody knew what they wanted their grunts to do. My responsibilities and focuses changed from week to week. "
bad,I enjoyed the people that i worked with.. did not get the correct pay for the work that i did for the company and all the positions i did to help them out. 
bad,Working at Target there isn't much of a work/life balance. Must be able to work with people that you cannot trust and that will make working very difficult. I would not recommend anyone to work at Target.
bad,"Like many consumers will say it is a great place to shop and I agree with them, however it is very far from a pleasant company to work for based on my experiences with the company."
bad,"I would check in and email the branch manager that the store was open. Check stock, talk to customers. Management was not the best. Meeting new people and making sales."
bad,They
bad,When I first started here I actually enjoyed the work and the position very much. All the team members were very amiable and the work environment was very pleasant. Things took a turn for the worst within the past year as a new store manager took over. From then on there has been a complete breakdown between leaders and team members. The work atmosphere has become tense and unpleasant. Hours have been cut for no reason other then selective process on who the store leader likes and dislikes. Team leaders do nothing other than dictate orders and threaten your job. Many employees are treated with a total lack of respect. There is no care for the team members as some members are given hours that no one can maintain a living with. In all I cannot suggest anyone work here.
bad,"The work is fairly mundane and tolerable, but when it becomes a necessity to interact with co-workers and managers headaches will ensue. The company doesn't treat it's employees well and that's putting it mildly. However, it is a job where you can have flexibility in scheduling so long as notification is provided in advance."
bad,"Just a stop by to make some money, while in school. It was great exercise, fast paced."
bad,"this place used to be a decent workplace,you were hired full time or part time with a fixed schedule and weekly pay but as with all major retailers in this country it went the way of the Dodo - slashed hours even to employees who been there the longest years,no job security, management is favoritist giving hours to their pet workers who stir dissent among employees and does whatever they please not respecting seniority or employees good track record."
bad,I experienced rude managers and customers on a daily basis.
bad,Dictatorship organization on the other hand the employees who work their are great but are blinded to the truth.
bad,People here were very caring. It is unfortunate my time here was short.
bad,supervisor was very immature and the co-workers were also. Poor hours and no respect give for your hard work. BAD environment
bad,"$20hr equates to a minimum wage. then again that's not their fault...its the overtaxed state of New York."
bad,They say they pay well but as of currently they only give work once a week and I have to beg for hours for the upcoming schedule. Mostly they tell you some rehearsed line about pay cuts but only a certain set of people experience the time cuts.
bad,This place is absolutely terrible. They do not treat their employees well AT ALL. The managers are selfish and don't do any work. They expect the lower employees to do ALL the work and act like their minions while they sit on their fat butts and socialize with each other. They are not sympathetic to ANYTHING and expect the employees to devote their lives to work. The pay is decent but not worth it.
bad,The pay is good but it’s a toxic work environment and if you aren’t a favorite you’ll get little to no hours. The Only time the care is when there’s a visit
bad,I didn't like working for target the management was not team orientated  the environment wasn't a team atmosphere  I wouldn't work for that establishment again
bad,Managers will schedule your time off at a certain time and expect you not to leave at that time (stay past your off time). They expect you to help others but you can’t be helped when you’re behind. They don’t take your personal life into consideration unless you kiss behinds greatly.
bad,"I’ve been at this target location for a few months and having previous retail experience, I can say the store is lousy. Management likes to treat workers like children and will often gossip about other employees. They like to sit in the office and talk and joke but are quick to point out when non-managerial workers are slow on a given task. They love to use their power for the most insignificant reasons and can make you feel belittled. They cling to certain workers and pick their favorites. For someone like me who is reserved, just does my work, and goes home, I feel disconnected from management because I’m not lazy or one for gossip about other workers. On top of this, the work I do is repetitive. Same thing everyday day with absolutely no variation, just mind numbing. Zero motivation, can’t listen to music (the store doesn’t play any music either), and the customers are awful as well. But that’s retail, baby."
bad,Could use better training the management skills. Not rely so much on computers to handle minor task. Better background checks. Starbucks was great Target was hard to work with.
bad,"Loss Prevention Manager at this location was vandictive,harrassed me, never trained me always micro managed me and treated other people in the same postion way better then me. He would rotate my fixed schedule to accmodate the other person time wise. Address a concearn and he would make you pay for it."
bad,"Target is a joke. The management just ridicules you and treats you like a slave. They don’t care about your well being, the air is always broke and they refuse to let you have water. They pile on your work load them threaten to fire you when it’s impossible to finish. An employee got hurt and the etl didn’t care and took her time to get to her. HR doesn’t keep anything you tell them confidential and spreads it around to other managers. They’re liars and they treat you like a dog. Don’t work for them."
bad,"No work life balance , workload too much. Senior management pays no attention to associates, managers not very hands on,  recognition lacks do nothing for team."
bad,"The work was decent and fairly easy but the lack of care in both standards  and effort was very off-putting. I was by myself most of the time had a total of three training days to learn the majority of the department, I was not given time to do computer training which a higher up manager told me to do but was given no time to complete them. I felt completely lost. Things I was told during my short training were also incorrect as the food side manager told me I was doing them incorrectly but that was the only thing I was told. The other people who worked on days where I was not there would not always coupon the expiring products correctly and would also not rotate the meats correctly, putting newer meats in the front. This was probably done to save time as the schedule for the department rarely left time, at least for me, unless corners were cut."
bad,Wanna feel like you don't matter and they'll replace you at the drop of a hat? WORK AT TARGET. The management is completely based upon favoritism and if you're management get ready to be micro managed
bad,12 hour shifts for new people every weekend tons of mandatory overtime racist supervisors that pretend to care about your well being. if you get hurt they build a case against you  to say that your unfit for work to have you fired. minorities are assigned all the hard aggressive work wile others with less sonority get the easy work. i had a review that showed i exceed all expectations however my super visor marked me as needs improvement. he told me if he gives exceeding to everyone who deserves it that our production rate will go up. but gave exceeding expectations to most of the Caucasian employees with less satisfactory production rates
bad,Once your injured or slow down slightly they push you out however they can find they don't care about how the supervisors treat the people under them nor do they care how the workers treat each other
bad,"The managers complained because I was at the clock a minute early and because I got water. I would never recommend that target to anyone, especially not with the way Management works."
bad,"Everyday was a uphill battle just to drive there. Every morning was a battle with managers. Everyday was an argument about policy or law. Everything was ""racist, sexist, or discriminatory, unless you were liked by managers. If you were hated you were under constant surveillance and they tried to get you in trouble everyday."
bad,"Target will hire “seasonal” employees with the promise that with hard work and good effort toward customer satisfaction they will hire you on as a full time employee. See the lure to bring in “seasonal” employees is with above minimum wage and this promise all the while they have already filled employees who are at minimum wage in those positions. So at the end of your contract they always find a reason to let you go and bring in another batch of “seasonal” employees thus keeping down their need to provide benefits to employees which would cost Target profits. Not to mention how back breaking the work is to begin with. You have to constantly move boxes from the back room to your aisle of responsibility, unpack items, sort them and make the aisles pretty and return customer items to aisles all day. The store aisles aren’t small and some of the items can weigh a ton. Believe me when I say they expect perfection. Oh, and when you have to take excess items to the back room for storage you have to carry it up a 30 foot ladder, often very heavy objects, to shove them into near nonexistent spots for storage which only slows you down even more. All this while smiling and having to stop and ask every customer if they can find everything they need. The job is he!! and this coming from a woman who was in the Army."
bad,"I worked at this target for 2 months until I decided to just walk out. Each and everyday it was more problems, I stayed for a 11 hour day on top of my regular shift to no appreciation. The managers will put up a facade for your first weeks there constantly telling you how great you're doing and switch up immediately when you go alone.  Each even being 7 months pregnant they actual you  without off days even being part time.  Do not trust hannah."
bad,The management team only helps the gm leads that they like if they do not like u for any reason they set u up to fail. Target has restructured it lower management to get rid of the higher priced employees and set up the schedule so employees can not get a second job
bad,They expect you make many things in a very very short time. Leaders are disrespectful and always treat team members with threats. At least this happens in Miami area.
bad,Don't work here unless you want to work for a company that brags about profits in the quarterly meetings but if you ask about any tech being updated you will get a politician's answer.  Things are fixed by wrapping them in electrical tape and aren't replaced until totally un-fixable.
bad,"I quit that job because they didn't care about their employees, availability or giving proper shift hours. They also hinder workers giving us less time to do more work. Like resetting two aisle in only five hours while also bothering us about if we are done yet the entire time."
bad,They suck and they want you to do way more then they pay like I mean a lot more if anyone reading this they will force you to work and then say you can’t go home but then when you go over hours they get mad at you for not going home but any other time you do that they get mad for you leaving without asking also they want you to do a 3 person job in 4hrs back stop put out and even do candy when that’s not your job it’s just crazy
bad,"Good place to work for a few months. Your body will start to break down after awhile, fit or not. Management is extremely lazy over paid and disrespectful. If its too cold they'll be in there office, if it's too hot they'll be in there office talking/texting on there phones and watching you on the cameras. Leaderships being with your team through whatever the situation "
bad,"Terrible management, not enough cashiers/gest service representatives, a messy front-end (check lanes are messy), bathrooms rarely checked up on, they handed me too much to get done with only two hands. I basically did my job AND other cashiers jobs for them even though I am not even a manager there. Corporate decided to ""demote"" GSA's to revise a ""better front-end"" but that just made everything worse. SO MANY PEOPLE are UPSET to come to work now! I love the genuinely nice coworkers/team members, but there's a severe lack of training that I have to answer the simplest of questions every shift! PLEASE do not work there, the $13 an hour ISN'T WORTH THE TIME!!"
bad,"When I first started in 2016, I loved it. Everything was great, people enjoyed their job, the atmosphere was nice. The last two years have been downright awful. Target has done nothing except major cost cutting by getting rid of an overnight team, cutting ridiculously hard on payroll, corporate refusal to fix/replace broken equipment in stores, and using cut rate companies when they do decide to spend a little money for something to be fixed. They have made changes to the system that worked perfectly fine before and now it barely works at all. Everyday there is some global issue that keeps you from doing your job and it’s beyond frustrating for the people that come in to actually work. Target cut a lot of pay grades this last January to generalize most team members and pay the people that work hard unloading and pushing truck the same as a cashier who stands/sits around their entire shift doing mindless work."
bad,I loved my main manager & my coworkers but the rest of the staff was awful.Treat you like garage & act like its your fault.Target=abusive relationship
bad,"Target goes through staff like a revolving door. It’s the same story... pay is too low. Work expectations are high, minimum breaks and very little pay."
bad,"After spending 3 years in the Target environment, I have lost more and more respect for the management and fellow team members that surrounded me. After about the first 6 months of my hiring, the store team leader at the time was relocated to another location. A new STL was hired in his place, I would say that after her hiring the work environment took a huge downturn. An average day at work for a standard general merchandise team member would include ""zoning', re-shop, guest service, and the more than occasional need for assistance at the registers. The hardest part of the job was closing the store after the previous mid-shift workers would do nothing, including such tasks as pushing freight and setting labels that the morning team failed to accomplish. The culture in the workplace was toxic, multiple team members would never be reprimanded for their wrongdoings while the quiet ""head down and work"" team members would be harassed by management to ""step it up or lose your job"". The management as a whole was lackluster and poorly behaved."
bad,Target managers dont care about your needs. They will replace you and use you until there is no tomorrow. So my opinion is you're better off doing something else.
bad,"Start work after high school in retail be there since 2008 work all over the store to stocking to cashing to bike building, ran my on team for two year. I'm always have good attendances and work well with other."
bad,"There is absolutely no communication between any of the leads on duty, work extreme hours out of your availability without even asking, human resources and the store manger gossip constantly."
bad,"I was very happy as a manager for years. They turned on me like rabid dogs after a juristic culture change following increased wages throughout the company. I watched many higher up ""lifers"" ""seek other opportunities"" and then I was also shown the door after 6 years."
bad,"i worked at target for over a year & i saw multiple managers come & go. the management  was terrible & very irresponsable, many times the store will run out of supplies making the store struggle to do anything."
bad,"Too many people coming up with different ideas that take time to implement, by the time you slowly get a process down a new one is introduced to do on top of the other one with no additional resources. Lazy upper management that spends most of the time in the office on their phones."
bad,"Alright, first I should make it known I was a seasonal employee there so I didn't have as much experience as others, however there is still some things I can say that make me never want to go back to working there. "
bad,Target hasn’t been the same since Harold left.  It went downhill after that.  Everyone that is still there is miserable.  Only good thing about the job is the pay.  It’s like a big high school & full of drama.  Management sucks.  I was discriminated against
bad,The job is  very stressful They don’t care about people just the next dollar they going to make. Target likes to add more and more work to team members. People are dropping like flys that’s why they are always   Hiring ! That’s why “ expect more Payless “  is there business model !
bad,"They did not work around sports schedules even when  you gave advance schedule.  The higher ups gave unfair expectations, and acted with superiority.  They did not train new people well and expected you to do tasks like chase and catch mice.  I would not recommend them at all."
bad,"Overall would not recommend. The environment is very stressful and quickly became toxic due to being severely understaffed (like 5 people on what should have been a team of 20 understaffed), while at the same time payroll is not being increased to accommodate the excessive work load with the staff we had."
bad,They simply don’t care about employees. They will watch you drown and walk away. The absolute worst job I’ve ever had. The only plus is the pay.......
bad,"Management sucks,is constantly trying to get rid of long term employees. Any thing they can find to hold against you they will. You get managers with no experience or guys straight out of the military, who unfortunately are yes men. Do not go to work here, you will hate it. The upper management does not care about anything beyond personal advancement for there self.  They lie they cheat they back stab"
bad,"Loved the people I worked with for the most part. Kept cutting hours, some people were getting 10 hours or even less. Very inconsistent weekly hours, when left was averaging 14 hours per week, even after talking with management. When first started was around holidays, was getting avg of 30 - 36 hours, started cutting during Thanksgiving, though kept hiring, was told hours would increase after holidays, instead they continued to get worse into summer."
bad,"Very rude security and racist discriminating HR! Security will just reject you coming in as a new hire saying that ""if you worked here before, you can't work here again"". Local HR not wanting to hire anyone again and say you can work at other Targets, while the Headquarter HR says ""there is no policy saying you can't work at the same Target again and are allowed to work at the same location"". They will give you the run around to pretend you will be hired and not hire you at all! "
bad,orientation for cashier consists of watching videos that don't tell what you actually need to know. You watch a cashier for 1 hour then your thrown on a machine and have to ask questions as things come up The GSA never relate to you things that have changed that would assist you in doing your job then when a problem arises you are blamed for not knowing  . One GSA  in particular is very degrading to you and really makes you feel stupid along with not helping you She is rude to you in front of customers. The cashiers that are there are a great group of people very helpful but as I said management and one GSA makes your life miscible. It does not need to be this way. I have spoken to other cashiers that have been there for a good amount of time and they say they are stressed and not supported by management and there is a lack of communication towards then for everyday .business and what is in the future for the store and their position
bad,"Work expectations sometimes unrealistic. You only get two breaks, in an ten hour it’s a thirty and a 15. In a twelve it’s 30 and a 20. Very exhausting work."
bad,"Wasn't trained very well they had me follow around employees for my first couple of shifts, and just expected me to know every part of my job. One of my duties was to unload trucks in the mornings, and I had no clue what I was doing ever and they just expected me to know all the details of unloading."
bad,"Awful Management, Expectations that are beyond fantasy.  Management and up the corporate ladder only cares about production and saving money.  If you start making too much, you'll be gone and replaced with cheaper labor.  If you dont mind being treated like dirt and just want a paycheck, go for it."
bad,"Do not... I repeat DO NOT work for this company. Me and 20+ others all over the country agree that this place of employment is very unprofessional. They rush you through training, management and HR are very unprofessional. Scheduling is not flexible and they show favoritism. One of my managers tried to steal out of my locker as well! I worked at the als Moana location 100% would not recommend to anyone, ever."
bad,"I was new to Target and been in retail over 20 years. The interview was complete opposite of actual job. No support in upper Management. Asking questions to certain leaders, they had attitudes I was basically a babysitter for cashiers. Horrible location Missouri City. Things happen in life unexpected and they only care about the business not the employees."
bad,You do not get enough hours and when you ask for more hours or that you need a certain amount of hours they do not give you them and continue to cut hours.
bad,"Management is a joke. We received a new LOD/ETL and she was completely unprofessional, rude, and degrading--yelled at multiple team members making accusations of them bullying their superiors or not treating Target as their priority, despite giving you 12 hours a week. New managers are from JcPenney, and are hiring new personnel from JcPenney and favoring them over Target employees who have been with the company for a long period of time. You will not be treated fairly, or like a valued individual. I will never recommend anyone work for Target, but I still love shopping there."
bad,"When I worked at target, I was there for multiple years and they were starting new hires at a higher wage then what I was receiving and a higher wage than what people that had been there a decade. Also, they just kept taking more and more hours away, leaving us to struggle with massive amounts of workload and not enough manpower or hours to get it done. Even most supervisors aren’t allowed to be full time."
bad,Terrible Management. Showed favoritism and you were basically shunned if you weren't fake/a kiss up and just wanted to do your work and go home. Expected 2 people to do a job on a team that required at the least 5 people and would actually expect you to finish around the entire store.
bad,"Bad management in the back where unloading the trucks the "
bad,"Only work here if you are just trying to acquire some entry-level job experience. Hours are alright, but pay sucks. You can definitely do better than this."
bad,"very fast paced , people only care about themselves they change policies daily and want you to know them all job security is nowhere to be found upper management only care about getting things done as fast as possible worked there for over 22 years and got fired for no real reason"
bad,"Although I was hired to work >24 hours per week and ALL of the part time employees wanted more hours, the HR manager continually hired more people. It was impossible to get more than a few hours per week. Target Corp. thinks paying workers $12 is decent pay yet will not allow employees more hours. Managers come and go as employees quit to gain employment where more hours are given like Walmart. Managers dance around the truth and cannot be trusted. Good employees are disposable, you are just a body like to the lazy ones."
bad,"management does not care about their employees, will do anything they can to save their job, even if it means loosing their best employees. if you dont kiss up to them, no matter how hard or dedicated a worker you are, to them youre useless. "
bad,"Terrible. I worked here for over a decade and I can easily say that Target doesn't really care for it's workers, especially lower level positions. The new process is horrible, they give you more work and less scheduled time to do it and of course no raise is given with the extra workload. I knew a lot of people here and most ""lifers"" employees felt the same way, it's pretty much a ""like it or leave it"" kind of attitude. You'll be in charge of a block in the store and you'll be expected to zone, do labels, set planos, do your pulls for the backroom, and backstock, it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that some of the leadership (ETL logistics) expect you to also push the truck, which can take hours, mind you, you only get scheduled 6 or so hours a day to complete all this. The only real cool part about this job was the people there, most were cool, some were not."
bad,"Had several managers that had 0 clue what they were doing.  While the company says they schedule around college hours, mine scheduled me every week at unavailable hours and then complained to me every week about missing hours."
bad,Depending on the person you were working with it could be fun. Some of the managers would sabotage you to get ahead but others would make sure you got the treatment you deserved.
bad,"Both my sister (for 3 years) and I (1 year) have worked for target (at two different stores) and we have both had horrible experiences working there. At first when I joined it was great. It had a team feel and was fun to work at. But slowly all the good people left and the management got WAY worse. The store leader was the creepiest, the managers didn't do anything but were rude and expected you to constantly work even if its not busy and even if they aren't doing anything. They are constantly hypocritical. There is no reward for putting in effort or working hard. The only way I can describe this work environment is soul sucking. Do not work here."
bad,"Most people come here because they are attracted to the pay and because Target recruiters talk about a great ""work culture"". That culture only exists at corporate; corporate looks down on the field operations and fires people at will. They demand 60 hour work weeks for 3 mos of the year, and 50 hour work weeks for another 3 months. Pays good...but either your health will suffer first or you will be fired. They have a safety guy whose job is to make you prove beyond a reasonable doubt you were injured at work."
bad,"From the outside seems nice happy place to work but working there makes you want to quit everyday "
bad,"Started working with 40 hrs per week now 6 years later it has been cut to 4 to 8 hrs per WEEK! No one can work with only 4 to 8 hours per week! New hires are given 40 hrs per week.Vacation hours are given by how many hours you work not by longevity which is not fair in my book as you can't dictate how many hours that you work.  Schedules are posted on the wall weekly but you have to check the computer daily because they change them all of the time which means you can't make any plans ie Drs appointments, 2nd job, etc."
bad,"I really want people to work for the market department, everywhere else is not all that bad but market is really stressful. Good luck you everyone who gets that job"
bad,"My manager was racist, the store culture presented a dichotomy between the managers and regular team members and I was one of the managers saying this."
bad,"Was a wonderful company when I first started. Usually worked between 24-30 hours per week. Company restructured their flow team in September, which increased our hours to 40+ hours. December before Christmas we were cut to 12 hours a week, never went back up. Job duties increased as now you answer phones, cash customers, do store audits, plus your normal stock duties, all in 4 hours. Literally have to run to get things done."
bad,"I have worked at target for around 4 years and am very dissatisfied with every part of it. I am 19 and started working there when I was in high school. Management is tough on teens and young adults to have a 100% flexible schedule and it is hard to get your availability changed or even change it at all to what one would want. Since I have worked there for so long and have experience in all areas of the store, they have never recognized my efforts or  expertise while older adults after working there a couple months already get the opportunity to train people while they never considered me. Also almost every shift I have had, I would have to do an unrealistic amount of work in the hours I was scheduled."
bad,"Team members do not get treated with an ethical amount of respect and is seen as replaceable, employees and are deemed inefficient when the expectations they regular put on us are outrageously high"
bad,Poor poor poor work environment.. Hot in summer 90 plus degrees in warehouse. Fired because I was 18 minutes late due to a fatal car accident on freeway
bad,worked here for about 9 months and it has been chaos the entire time. Moved around the store three different times and am not able to master my department because of always changing polices. company wants you to unload enormous amounts of freight but still go do back up on the register and carry out products. good job if you can split yourself into eight people at once.
bad,Managers are never on the same page. You are promised hours and may get them for a week to make you happy then they go right back to not enough. They tell you whatever they need to say to get what they need done then just throw you away when its complete. Terrible Managers!!!
bad,Worked a lot then out of nowhere hours get cut tremendously. Call the day of to be there within an hour sometimes after your hours have already been cut
bad,"I was hired in pricing and working 40 hours every week but it wasn’t long after that when they reduced my hours to 18hours a week. And yesterday I got tired of not having hours so I walked out. At the store I was working at, the managers cared more about making friends with the workers than actually being bosses and always staying in their offices than actually helping us on the floor"
bad,"It is easy to get done what you need to get done but management will hassle you if you aren’t moving as fast as sonic the hedgehog,  the pay is worth the poor management you have to put up with"
bad,"The team below you is generally great, however the company dictates everything you do and how to do it in order to make it idiot proof.  Any separation from this or innovating is no longer appreciated.  Leading the staff at a store manager level should be an independent practice, but it is also micro managed.  The company only promotes those with the right ""image"" who are on social media about their successes and does not care about those who are performing highly if they do not conform to the corporate image for a role.  It was a disappointing transition to see over the last year - the PA groups went from focusing on performance in all areas to focusing on how people fit the ""cute"" image and didn't cause ripples or oppose direction.  I think this company is going to be heading for a windfall soon by not focusing on the right type of leadership - stay away!"
bad,"I was with target only for a few months. It was easily one of the most poorly managed places I've ever worked at. They don't train you so you basically have to figure everything out by yourself. The scheduling was complete chaos. They expect their employees to come in early and stay late, but you're not allowed to hit overtime which makes zero sense. They want more from you than you can give. Overall, it was just super impersonal and stressful and I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,"This company has moved far away from it's morals when it comes to the front line work force, starting from the ETL (Executive Team Leader) level, all the way down to the team members, it is very unfortunate to see, but a necessary part for the company longevity. Definitely not a place to work for long term even if you are in desperate need, but ideal for a college student who needs a job for a few semesters. If you are a college graduate, please do not waste your talents, and potential with this company."
bad,"not even worth my time. i hate this place, and i will never have anything good to say about it, not now, not ever. SMD target, i will NEVER work or shop here again thx"
bad,Its all about metrics and being GREEN! Its beginning leadership for dummies. You do not learn about business acumen. Target is like survivor... You come in with a huge group of people and every month someone is gone. Long work week and 70hr expectation at holiday season. Target lacks diversity in the Chicago area.
bad,The management expect miracles but don't give you the time to accomplish anything. the hourly pay is nice but in the end its not worth it since they love to cut hours and make you do more with less time.
bad,The managers were very rude. I would get my work done at a good time. They would try to ask you to stay later. The pay could have been a little better for the type of work I was doing.
bad,"Toxic environment. Unrealistic goals. Rude patronizing bosses. No advancement unless in the clique, too much expected in too short of time to complete"
bad,"At Target most people are at a quick working pace, but a lot are very slow. I was at a quick pace always helping customers and it was okay. While being at Target I got to experience customer help and how to make customers feel welcomed."
bad,"New policies have recently been introduced that create more work per employee with no compensation and insufficient staff. Not great benefits, low vacation/ sick pay, biased management, and poor hours. Some managers were excellent at their jobs, but the same amount was some of the worst I've seen; the quality of management directly affects your quality of work life. Most positions are also very physically demanding, both lifting and being on your feet constantly. If you have a good team leader, it is much easier to enjoy your day-to-day job life much less stress-free. This is a good place to work as a seasonal employee, but not many benefits for being a permanent one."
bad,"I worked for Target for almost 5 years. Over the course of those years I endured 3 store managers and countless assistant store managers. When I first started I actually enjoyed being at work and it felt like a family, however, after they started boosting the minimum hourly pay, I noticed quite a significant shift in how employees were treated. Instead of using “coaching” as teaching moments to encourage and improve employees, they became a way to write people up until they could be fired. Some of the management also gossips to subordinates about who they are going to fire. They actually have a joke that goes “they’re about to be promoted...to guest..” hilarious right? "
bad,"I was ready to give Target a high rating when they announced, upon my hiring, that, as a company, they would be pushing for $15/hour minimum starting wages. And on the surface, this is great. But the one common refrain I've gotten from my fellow associates is that the hours they give are sparse and hardly anyone works 40 hours a week. Meanwhile, we were constantly pressed to do more, faster, necessitating sloppiness at every turn...which of course, created more complaints from management and more work for everyone involved."
bad,"Marketsource is a contractor of target that sells mobile devices. They are horrible, they promised me more money than I made. They never gave me a raise. I had one manager i could talk to face to face and even that was rarely, the next higher up was two states away, We didn't recieve pay stubs and i wasnt given access to the website to view mine until my 3rd month. Target is great, the pay is great, and the people are great, but marketsource is awful."
bad,"Terrible management from my former boss drove me as far away from this job as possible. He was so aggressive and unnerving that he sent my manager home with an anxiety attack. It's a wonder that he still has his job. Target also routinely ignores requests for days off or change in availability. Talking to HR does no good. They say they will look into it, and then never do."
bad,"Working there for years, and all of a sudden some 22 year old who never worked a say in their life is now your boss. What kind of sense does that make?"
bad,They let groups inside the company to have multiple managers and no workers who don't know how to manage anything and ultimately make multiple mistakes. Than they are allowed to lie or make stuff up so they don't lose contracts or other groups and easily scam people. When doing actual work they rather send the work off to other groups instead of working on it themselves saying they can't fix it and do little documentation for said issue. They also hire people who don't have any experience in their field and their degrees are not applicable to the fields they work in.
bad,"When I got the job, I was excited. Co-Workers were very friendly.  A couple weeks into the job LODs were beginning to be a bit rude. I never got the credit I deserved, customers would admire my help and LODs would tell me my customer service was horrible. It was very stressful. The pay and hours were horrible. The favoritism in that place was unfair. I only got 8-20 hrs a week. My raise was disappointing because of all my unnoticed hard work. I never got a good compliment from them, which is why I left..."
bad,"This was only seasonal, and I would never do it again. There were too many positions for equipment, I got yelled at because I didn't know what to do, and the person I shadowed left to go on break. I was given three days of training, where the most I learned about was on the register."
bad,"The work environment at target is horrible. There are impossible objectives and a serious lack of staff. They will schedule around 5 people to zone the entire store. And the STL at this location is horrendous. She makes up rules specific to this store, enforces them and then blames employees when guests are upset by the rules. Also, she berates staff members over the walkies to try to embarrass them. If you feel the need to work at a big box store, don’t choose this one. Also, they will trick you into signing up for a credit card and show you how to trick guests. BEWARE."
bad,"The Glenview store is the worst. "
bad,There was no flexibility in my position at Target. I was promised full-time employment but hardly ever received thirty hours per week. Management not enthusiastic to promote a healthy work-life balance.
bad,"Used to be a good place to work.  Now policy coming down have put everyone on edge.  No longer nice, just a grindstone where everyone is on eggshells and even the nicest people have turned sour.  Sucks the life and energy out of good people."
bad,"I liked several of the people that i worked with here and that was really the ONLY reason that i stayed there as long as i did. In my time there, i watched 3 managers cycle in and out, 15+ employees cycle in and out, and 1 HR person just up and leave due to poor management, stressful work environment, and overall poor-pay per what you were doing. You would start out doing basic things, then gradually learn more and more, then when you would ask about a raise for all the extra work you put in, they would tell you ""you get a fair wage & will receive yearly raises"" I was asked to start staying after my shifts to assemble bikes, furniture, etc & when i asked for a raise for the extra work & hours, they told me no, nad offered me 1/2 off discounts for the food-court instead. Managers were OVERLY fast paced here, mean, and if you couldn't keep up because were tired, sick, or in one girls case, pregnant, they would send you to another area where you could be ""slow"" or they would send you home. They have ""personal lockers"" there for you to store your personal belongings while at work, but you have to pay 25c daily to lock them up. "
bad,"I used to love Target and thought a job with them would be great. That quickly changed when I was hired and saw how horrible the management was. Micro-managing everything, breathing down my neck, belittling me, and many more unnecessary management issues. Never complied with my availability. The managers are basically corporate slaves that don't care about the well-being of their employees. Horrible job experience and I now have a completely negative outlook on Target."
bad,They cut hours a lot. They don't pay much. the management is horrible. They don't know what they are doing. They have pressure on you to make sure everything is packed. So THERE number is not affected. INF's (canceling orders don't have in stock) They give you attitude and make you look for the item even if it was not in the store.
bad,I feel like I just started working at Target and I felt unappreciated when I first started. I never got a name tag like the rest of my coworkers (not even a temporary one just a random one with someone else's name). The management just simply didn't care and just because they have a four-year degree (in anything) they think they're so important. None of the LOD's have any consideration for how long things take or how much work we already have when they tell us to do 5 other things before the day ends. It's a stressful job especially when you're working E&F making 12 and the electronics dept makes 13 and they just stand there and sort of help with E&F. Not fair especially when they leave you to cover electronics without any training expecting you to know what to do.
bad,I was alone at nights in my department.  Not even the manager's would help me.  Not worth the time of applying.  Plus the managers play favorites.  Was treated very unfairly.
bad,"out of a team of ten, eight had excuses for why they couldn't work in the freezers, ranging from its not good for me to i don't want too. Managers not only accepted these but enforced them."
bad,"I have worked for Target for 8 years and i have some good and some bad memories. I would say the current Target is very anti worker. They have the attitude that it is better to have 40 people working 20 hours a week rather than having 20 people work 40 hours a week. The problem with this mindset is that you create disenfranchised workers who depend on those hours to pay bills. When you start screwing with peoples hours, any loyalty they have for the company vanishes. Worker begin to care less about the job they are doing and more about looking for something else. This also hurts your customer base because the first people to buy your products are the people closest to you, and if you have pushed them to hating the target product, you are sending a message to the masses that you have a bad product. Management will also find people that are hard workers and start floating the idea that they are looking to move that worker up to get even more out of them with no intention of ever moving them up. Target is cheap and doesn't care about their employees."
bad,Stl acts as if everyone is below him. He hides in his office unless his boss comes in to visit. The TLs have too many personal problems and takes it out on their employees (reasons why everyone leaves)
bad,"Come here to make a quick couple grand and pay off debts, then find a new job. That's literally the only thing this place is good for."
bad,don't believe what they tell you in orientation. mostly everything is a lie. especially about the heirchy system they claim to not have. also they do a lot of wrong things and when corporate comes we have to scramble to make it right.
bad,"I thought when I got my diploma I was done with high school. The managers are jocks who peaked in high school and have nothing better to do than hit on teenagers. If you have any self esteem, get a different job. It seems okay at first but it's a trap."
bad,"Sadly, this was my first job out of college. I was recruited into a management position that I wasn't ready for. Instead of helping me grow, the other women in management roles bullied and harassed me (including one who was in an HR role). I am so lucky to have realized this early in my career. I am also fortunate to have moved on to a position with a different company and a supervisor who respected me and helped me grow as a person/leader."
bad,"I regretfully worked here seasonally for the holidays. My manager for my department was unbelievably condescending and rude. Training was non existent, my trainer actually left 20 minutes after being assigned to train. Asking questions from others was clearly a burden. There was so much tension and hostility towards seasonal team members. I look back and wonder if it was me, but the team at this store is/was sickening to deal with."
bad,I don't recommend working here because job security isn't guaranteed. Sometimes hours are very inconsitent and you'll work 25 hours one week and 9 hours the next.
bad,"Worked 10 years for this company. Some of the time I enjoyed, I worked between 3 different stored. 2 I loved, the one I am looking to leave disliked from day 1. Leadership is not up to the standards I was used to. Communications between peers is extremely extremely poor. Given multiple different directions because the executive team leads do not communicate before allocating task to their department leads.  Store I originally started with was great. Training was always available, communication was consistent, team in general had a helpful attitude. I enjoyed my time there for the 5 years I was there."
bad,It is a job for students or individuals who don't necessarily need to work or need money. It is difficult to survive with children or pay any major bills or support yourself. The management always reduces hours for people who have tenure and give them to new hires. They hire roughly 4 employees a month.
bad,"I had one of the worst experiences at target, not to mention all of my coworkers would quit because of how horrible it was."
bad,"The current job culture has changed from a huge emphasis on team effort, to every man for himself. There are too many responsibilities for just one person to complete in a day and when you're behind there isn't anyone who can help you get caught up. With the increased starting salary at this company, I make $0.30 more than someone who just go hired yesterday and I started 5 years ago."
bad,"When I started, they offered me 40-50 hours weekly then cut me back to 20-30, and I would be into work by 4am to unload trucks. The hours were making me sick but unfortunately, there wasn’t a resolution."
bad,"I worked at Target for almost three years up until recently.  When I started, it was pretty good.  You could sign up for other shifts to get more hours and I felt like the company culture actually cared.  As time progressed, I took their bench project and passed with flying colors.  I felt really accomplished and after awhile, a team lead position opened."
bad,"Gerente Andreia da Target Rj tratava mal,assédio moral com os funcionários tive  a tristeza de trabalhar em 2014 com esse ser sem luz e péssima profissional!Nota 0 pq a empresa encobria tudo que ela fazia"
bad,Target's management is just as bad as wal-marts. they sit on their butts doing nothing and can't get real life and their expectations on the same page.
bad,"I was recruited by Target earlier this year for an ETL salesfloor role.  As soon as I started I realized the store culture was much different from what I expected.  My executive peers along with my store leader had their own sub-culture clique.  As I know culture is important I tried to develop relationships with them with no success. I focused on my training and doing what I was hired to do which was manage and master the business.  I soon realized that I was in high school again. Management gossips, management whispers, and your work ethic or experience is irrelevant, as long as you're ""accepted"" and considered ""cool"" you can be a lazy sack of dung.  I met a lot of cool people in the store I was at on lower management, but the company culture is no where near what is advertised and you're days are long. You work 10+ hour days on salary and to me it's definitely not worth it.  It was a terrible experience for me.  PLEASE BE WARNED BEFORE YOU WORK FOR THIS COMPANY. I heard that every Target has a terrible culture like the one I was at."
bad,"While the company itself boasts encompassing their employees health and well being, certain store management teams lack the follow through. When you start they'll give you the speech about not wanting you to be there if you are contagious, have a fever, or are unable to control certain bodily functions. However, when these illnesses actually occur and you have to call off, your job is threatened. I worked with several people who were forced to come in with the flu. One guy had a temp of 102.7, he was told to come in or resign. A strong work ethic and reliability get you nowhere, as only those in high favor receive recognition. The harder you work, the more they keep you at the lowest possible hourly pay rate, so don't count on good raises. Some of the management team were bullies, and the rest were forced to look the other way."
bad,"My experience with Target was less than enjoyable. There were a few coworkers that made the early mornings and late nights bearable, but for the most part, the team leads and LOD's weren't at all helpful or friendly. Having to try to sell the Red Cards to every guest that came through the door made each day an unnecessary competition, for which there was no prize. They never hired any employees full-time, therefore no one was offered any benefits. Raises and promotions were next to impossible to achieve. Overall, I wouldn't recommend taking a job with Target unless you need a little extra spending money, because a little is all you will get."
bad,"rapid management turn over means constant change and potential conflict with over zealous managers who don't understand business. Job is repetitive and therefore caustic to joints. Many injuries that are not protected by law. Lower back, rotator cuffs, wrists, elbows, ankles, knees, and feet. Management inconsistent and arbitrary. Training inadequate, Safety training inadequate"
bad,"Easy work, laid back approach. Competitive credit card gains. Competitive sales floor incentives. Percentage off when shopping online or in the store at all times. Management is lazy and often times blames employees for not finishing tasks in the few hours they get to work. They do not  work well with scheduling time off or working with your hours."
bad,"I only speak from  my 8 years of working there.  The reviews seem rigged.  Management changed every 3-6 months.   8 years working and my pay went from $8 to $10, then my hours depleted to the point I had to file unemployment. And sneaky - while receiving unemployment they snuck me back unto the schedule without my knowledge to have it seem like I quit so I had to go back to work with JUST ENOUGH to legitly keep me from unemployment.  They say advancement through the company but outsource for management.   I'd never go back unless the pay was right."
bad,"This target has the most miserable management that I have ever seen. One would tell you one thing another would tell you something different. I worked hard but I never appreciated being yelled at. All the managers are females. Most of them were fine to work with but at least 2 made my life miserable. Unless you happen to be part of their little group, you’re screwed. Most unorganized place I’ve worked at. I couldn’t take anymore and took a job that I love. Professional people instead of miserable, hateful people, who called themselves leads or managers."
bad,"Not a place for hard work or original thought. If your ideas aren't in line with management you won't receive any hours."
bad,"A typical day at work starts with a checklist of things to do, and the expectation that you help customers to the best of your ability. While this is fine, when you don't finish your tasks on time, managers are not understanding about the fact that helping customers takes up time."
bad,I work at Brooklyn Junction store 2212 this place is trash. Day Side does what they want meanwhile overnight has to constantly do double work. We leave thee stockrooms clean only to come back to pure mess.
bad,"Worked at Target for 3 1/2 years. When I first started, their minimum wage was at $9. Okay, sure, Thats great for some 18 year old kid. 3 years later, I am making the same exact amount of anyone walking in the door. My store team lead constantly kept telling us that we did not have what it takes to progress in the store, but constantly looked to us when they were in trouble. Could not wait to leave."
bad,The management is awful!!!! My managers treated me horribly and with no respect at all. I highly recommend not working for this company.  I worked for target for over a year and will not even shop there anymore because I don't want to give a company that treats their employees badly any of my money.
bad,pull merchandise from the back room .I learned hard work. The management was incompetent and lackadaisical. The workplace was fast paced and sometimes doing more than one job at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the people I worked with.
bad,"The work environment had changed immensely while I was there. The new manager we had gotten, was very closed minded and had a ""it's my way or the highway"" management style."
bad,"Not sure that it pertains to all Target stores, but the one in Rossford, is hostile culture. Management that treats you like an animal  and you never know what mood you are going to walk in to everyday. Best part of the job is your coworkers. Just do your job and keep anything to yourself. Don't call the hotline to complain. It is a waste of time."
bad,"They promise a lot, but have lack of deliver. Hard work and perfect attendance isn't always enough here. The smallest things can cost you your job. They don't give warnings they just fire you the first chance they get. Extremely strict about everything. You see very many come and go, more then your usual job."
bad,"In short, it's not uncommon for the management to be inexperienced or totally lacking in the skills necessary for success to run a department. For example, our manager who's in charge of the engineering and facilities division has a degree in Business, he doesn't actually know anything about the work we do, and is incapable of assisting us in any matters relating to our actual work.  I say this with as much respect as I'm able to muster, he's simply a warm body."
bad,The management at the Waterford lakes location is horrible. They do not try to work with your school schedule. their job comes before anything else in your life.
bad,"If you don't conform to their personality and change yours you're out. Forget about being yourself and keeping personal life private, they will dig to find anything on you"
bad,"You worked hard all day long, and its not bad once you get in your groove. I learned a lot about a Distribution Center, and how it works. How people order and reiceve things threw them, which I found very facinating. The management isn't very good, they tell you multiple diffent things, nobody is on the same page. There is no communication between teams. The hardest part was standing on concrete for 12 hours at a time, but it was always worth it for the pay."
bad,"I handled cash register, and customer service desk, and gave Target cafe their breaks. I trained many employees and someone I trained got the team lead position I was up for. I learned that there is favoritism in the workplace. management was very unprofessional. the hardest part of the job was knowing how to do everything in the front of the store and training people with no power to help when they needed change or if they needed a break and the current team lead was no where to be found. the best part  of the job was the discount."
bad,Target work environment sucked they did not ever address any issues and would brush drama under the rug unless it involved a manager and fired and demoted Associates unfairly.
bad,I've worked for Target for years and the one thing I can say for sure is if you kiss the right you know what your gonna be fine but if your just a day to day worker get ready to work your butt off while you watch the members of management hang out in the lunch room for a good hour or two daily. Watch managements fav team members call out every other week but if your not a best friend and you call out you best have a good reason or get ready for an ear full over the phone....
bad,"You will hate working in retail at Target in Tinley Park. They'll give you the hours during seasonal, however, they can careless about your well being as an employee. They may act like they care, but they don't. They highly recommend that you come to work on time also."
bad,"No one recognizes the good work you do, but every mistake is repeatedly harped on by countless managers. They cut hours dramatically and still expect you to be able to get more and more work done."
bad,This was a seasonal position during the Christmas holidays. It was extremely fast paced and stressful. I found it very difficult to stand on my feet for long periods of time and it was hard on my back lifting heavy items to be purchased.
bad,I worked there for several years but the new managment is running the store into the ground. If you get a backroom position prepare to work in a messy environment because management doesn't care. Lack of hours and coverage.
bad,"There wasn't much to this job. At first I worked at a store that was good but moved to a different store and realized just how bad this company is. They would not give me more than 20 hours a week. I was constantly criticized on how I did my job. I was disrespected on my first day at my new store. Management had no idea what they were doing. Everything was a disorganized mess. I had put in my two weeks notice after finding a better job and had to deal with a family matter on my final week. I called to let them know that I would not be able to make it due to this matter. I was then told I would be marked as unhireable and would not be able to work for Target again, All of that for nearly two years of working as hard as I could and doing everything they ask. I know understand why there is the ""We Hate Target"" website."
bad,"I was on the grocery team and it always seemed like we weren't a team most members ended up doing more work than others. Management doesn't know what they wanna do too many hands in the management cookie jar. Management never showed any appreciation or recognition unless you were a pet they played favorites. Never enough hours, no consistency schedule wise. Management always had snide unprofessional comments never recognized you for what you did they always attacked what you didn't do."
bad,"it was terrible i have giant work loads squeezed into tiny 4 or 5 hour shifts, they never have hours and i usually end up doing work outside my department and pay rate because people are either under trained or they didnt schedule enough workers. Also most of the management doesnt know what theyre doing or just doesnt care."
bad,"But once, you've reached a certain age and salary, you're a liability. Target expects more every year, while giving less. Payroll restrictions over the past few years have been ludicrous. Management turnover at the store level is high because they hire kids out of college with no experience and expect them to be experts immediately."
bad,"Generally, don't plan on working here as a career. more as a stepping off point. It has some great balance of work/life but promotes from outside and has a toxic culture."
bad,"Inbound trainer for 4 years at Stuarts Draft D.C. Always busy was a plus. Never got the training hours alouded to get my new hires ramped up to speed in their 90 day probation period before them being scrutinized over and over for there numbers and production not being up to par for targets standards and eventually terminated. One trainer per 35-40 people with pay equal to a regular team member. Taking work home with me after work hours. And still expected to make my numbers (prod) with me spending half of my 10-12 hour shift away from my trainees helping warehouses problems. Impossible to get my new hires ramped up when I'm getting called all throughout the warehouse leaving my new hires stranded and clueless with questions with their trainer no where in sight. Management is an absolute joke. Any regular team member knew twice as much as the operations manager. 5 times a day they'd come to the trainer asking questions about what they should do next. And there the ""20"" year olds with a college degree. Management can't manage their way out of a paper bag :( so sad to say. Expected to make production when you standing there with your hands in your pocket waiting 15+ min on a piece of equipment your sharing per 5 people then they coach  you about why your numbers are so bad because you literally couldn't do anything until that equipment freed up. But they don't care nor realize what's really going on from their lap top they sit at for 10-12 hours a day. All I can speak for is Stuarts Draft D.C but if you like being a grunt and very expendable then this IS the job for you. Pay and"
bad,No advancement. Can't share your ideas. Unsafe work environment. Treat you very poorly. Worst work experience I've ever had. But pay and benefits are great.
bad,It use to be fast fun and friendly place to work. But now half the employees have quit or are trying to leave. Times have changed and I would definitely recommend not working here.
bad,I worked at the Target little over a year. After the Internet breach on their system they were firing people left and right and who ever the management their at that time pushing people to work extra. They were complaining about why we not selling and making money. People don't want to do business with you after the breach.
bad,"Target Distribution was my workplace for 91 days. The entire time I was there, everyone had trouble hitting numbers, as they were changing all their processes around. I was, on average, 5% below people that had been there 2+ years. Since they were already past their 90 days, they had job security that I did not. Every day I'd be at 90% until one of the managers would stop me for 45 minutes and make me wait for work. They ended up firing me, even though it was them that made me wait for work every day. Decent pay, but absolutely terrible management, safety, and human resources."
bad,"This company doesn't offer any kind of benefits until you have been employed for a year. They ask you to do things that are not right, like putting in training for employees and they haven't even completed it."
bad,"Personal Boss was fantastic but upper management was absent or ridiculed all of your work.  If you spent 80 hours a week helping the team and working extra hard in an attempt to further the company, management would still find a way to state that you werent working hard enough."
bad,Worked 3 a.m. shift to 7a.m.putting stock out. Not enough hours. Management was okay.  The hardest part was the time I had to arrive to work and wanted to work over wasn't allowed
bad,"Working in the backroom you're timed (like a race horse) for multiple tasks at once while staffed all alone, ESPECIALLY on busy holiday weekends. Expect to manage inventory, fulfill online orders, retrieve customer items, locate back stock, and much more simultaneously under a time limit. Even if you communicate all issues to management with an action plan, you'll still be written up because the store computer trumps all humanitarian logic. Every other employee across all departments are often very stressed and unable to finish their own workloads. This is because hours and scheduling has been dramatically slashed quarter after quarter until all associates work an average of 12 hours per week, unless you brown nose and focus more on flattering your manager, rather than actually working and staying on task. Management is both unsympathetic and oblivious to help with the workload or even understand whatever issue is at hand because they are also direly understaffed and overworked. The a stage annual raise at my store is ¢15 or less. Benefits are almost non existent and often times those employed in management positions are unfit because they lack maturity, leadership, and communication."
bad,Target always cuts your hours and expects you to do the same amount of work not caring if you have bills to pay. They always hurry you up even if you are going fast. I got a 30 cent raise after a year and a half even tho they tell me I am a hard worker and super fast. This place is a joke it helps if u got no other opinions other than thathat it's bad
bad,"I worked for this company a long time and thing have changed for the worst. Target lives up to it motto ""expect more pay less"". Not only do they expect you to do maintenance but also help the store team make sales. Their expectations are a set up for you to fail. You will find your self doing more housekeeping than anything else. Management is very demanding and most of the time you fing your self getting orders from people that are not even your direct manger. Very, very stressful during Holiday season. They want their buildings to be perfect for the holidays even though the buildings are old. One person to do all the work and 10 supervisors telling you to do 40 different things. Absolutely no overtime is allowed. You get coached if you you go over 5 min. When having district manager visits (which are almost every week) anything they find wrong is your fault, even when it's not your responsibility. You are the escape goat. Would not recommend this company. Not worth the stress."
bad,"The job it self is good, mon-Fri 6 to 230pm. Work can be challenging but depends on how good you are trained. Biggest down fall is Management. They do not care about the team members, they preach about development but it's all talk. They tend to promote a pretty faces over experince, exact words from HR-ETL, which hurts the moral of the team. They talk about fairness but they pick and choose who they reprimand I'm order to get the results they want.  No one is happy that works there, they Work hard for poor yearly compensation and a note that says you did good. Hours for normal team members are always cut back. The place is a joke."
bad,"This was the third time I have worked for Target in general. The stores were pretty good work environments with friendly employees and management. That would be why I applied for a third time, but to the Distribution Center this time. From the moment I started I knew it would be difficult at best. I was put on the week night shift (which was one of my least workable options) so I worked from the odd hour of 4:30 pm to 3 am. The trainer who trained me did not want to train at all, so I was left to either make up the information or find someone else willing to answer questions and not completely ignore me. After the training period they say they will ""work with you"" to get you to where they want you to be. By ""work with you"" I believe they meant threaten and warn you about speeding up or loosing your job. They say they have ""flexible scheduling,"" and it is if you count that it only flexes in their favor. By this I mean if they want you to work over time you work over time, if they don't need you, you get time off. If it is something you want or need, then forget it. Very few people make it through their initial 90 days, much less the 6 month seasonal period. If you choose to apply, I wish you luck."
bad,"Company is very focused on sales, not their workers. They have a great business ethic but being a 3rd party company. One that is partnered with Target can create communication issues in the store due to different ways of handling business."
bad,"Extremely poor management!!!  Group leaders were hired right out of college with no experience.  They would use Target as a place to gain experience/boost their resumes and then move on to a better paying job, usually, in about 2 yrs. That lead to a high turn over rate amongst management; leaving no strong pillars for the workers beneath them to lean on. (Look on LinkedIn for some of the management's years of experience at Target DC- not many have been there longer than 3 yrs.)"
bad,"Did not really care for this company one bit. Management was expecting a well performed job, when the pay was very underpaid"
bad,"I dislike the management, I dislike the hours that they gave me, and I don't like how they favor other people than those that have the potential and skills."
bad,"The Target I worked at was awful, managers were rude and hateful (mostly in their 20's and punks), they would never work around a schedule and they fired me 1 hour before my shift for legit no reason (I was seasonal hire but they just immediately dropped me without a heads up)."
bad,poor management hope leads to changes at  this store in a hurry. In need of a lot of direction guess that is why district manager is now here everday.
bad,"Target will expect you to work horrendous hours. You will get brainwashed into ""vibe and guest service"". Anything wrong will get you ""coached"" which is a manager telling you that you suck. They fire for reasons other than stated. Wouldn't recommend unless you desperately need rent money"
bad,For the most part it was pretty cool until new ppl came and made it a living h e double hockey stick it's just target they took it wayyyyy to serious talk to you and treat you like nothing cut hours over work for very little pay when they de ice to get rid of ambreia and a couple other bad apples then it would be a book job to have... discounts suck and can only use it if u have a target debit or credit card or cash. Uniform policy was the best until ppl started changing things just because smh
bad,"Years ago Target was a great place to work, and I'm sure it'll soon resume the previous standard. There's currently a huge focus in revamping stores organizational structure, and aspects like work place culture, overall employee satisfaction, and personal development initiatives have been placed on the back burner. This is a great job for recent graduates, as you gain meaningful experiences and grow as a person and leader. However, many managers quickly burn out, and turn over for the company is high."
bad,"This was a terrible job. They wouldn't let me have water to drink by my work station, the amount of work given to me was too much for one person, and they didn't take my complaints seriously. Management doesn't know what they're doing."
bad,"Management likes to push extremely hard for sales. If you are not a sales person this is not the place for you. A typical day is extremely fast paced as the store is busy 95% of the time. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with nice customers. Co-workers are nice, but there is a lot of gossip."
bad,"When i first started working for target i was positive and even a little bit determined to move up in this company but as the years passed it has made me miserable, depressive, pathetic and angry. The only thing i got from this company is the ability to transfer that's how i met my friends. Other than that management sucks they're, incompeted, lazy, brat-like, ignorant people. Who only care for they're paychecks and being able to sit in an office not do anything not even pay attention to the store and go home."
bad,"Target SUCKS!!!"
bad,It was difficult to work for a company that lost its way. The Manager and Group Manager layer needs replacement. I hope the changes that they are starting can change the entrenched management culture and not just right-size corporate staffing
bad,"I worked here for just about a year, and I was miserable. The pay was terrible, there were no raises, no advancement, and the management for the pharmacy was terrible, and the prescription system was old, confusing, slow, & outdated. The only good things about working there was the diversity, as in tattoos, bright hair colors, & piercings were accepted, and I enjoyed the patients that I interacted with. I do miss the pharmacists I worked with as well. I never worked above 25 hours a week. Target is known not to support the military, and that was just such a bummer to me."
bad,"A working day at Target is basically; I work with no assistance at the Target Café until my next team member comes in at 11:45am; and that's without any break.  I have learned the ups and downs of retail; and that Target does not care about their team members well being.  My co-workers are under a lot of stress as well to make sure that all their departments are taken care of without little or no help; due to the store cutting of hours. The hardest part for me to swallow is that they tell new employees that this is a fast, fun, and friendly store; whereas; employees come in and they are gone within a week or two. This is due to the dishonesty of the company giving false promises.  I will say the best part of going to work is being able to see, interact and have conversation with the guests that come into the store as well as my peers.  We lift each other up everyday."
bad,This is indeed a retail place of work. Ilike the location and my co workers. As far as the daily tasks that myself and the other co workers that I work with is too tasky and not do-able within the amount of time we are there working. I have to do my workcenter after I have done the truck process already for 2 hours and 15 minutes every day.
bad,The company prioritizes money above the well-being of it's employees. Management has no idea what they are doing. Minimal job security.
bad,"The work isn't that bad, but management decides to hire a bunch of people for three months then they fire them so they can repeat the process. They ended up keeping only one employee who was overworked with no assistance, out of a large group, . The co workers were mostly good people with a couple oddballs in between. I don't trust corporate stores like target anymore."
bad,"If you are looking to join Target as an Executive Team Leader, be sure you are ready to devote 55-60 hours a week minimum,which is the requirement. Although, during the recruiting process they preach work life balance which is none existent.The turnover in this position as unreal."
bad,I worked at Target for 3 years and although I have learned a lot about procedural structures.Target continued to actively block venues for advancement and inhibit job growth potential with subversive tactics and outright lying
bad,I've never seen a place so micromanaged in all my life. It was a monotonous job that showed no room for growth. I worked with people who had been doing it for years with  no moving up.
bad,"stocking the shelves "
bad,"They wouldn't hire any full time employees , so I quit when I moved up to Vancouver Washington."
bad,"2008-2010"
bad,"Management was very biased and didn't seem to care about their employees.  Your schedule was all over the place so it was hard to know when your off plus the Team Leads always got the shifts they wanted. "
bad,Target was a decent place to work as far as retail is concerned. But now the company is in trouble. Lots of good managers leaving for other opportunities leaving a vacuum that the company is filling with college grads with little or no retail experience. Hours are being cut by corporate so they can get everyone's average hours down below the threshold where your considered full time and eligible for health benefits. They did away with giving part time team members benefits starting in 2014 and their new goal is to get as many team members down to part time status. They say there is not enough hours to give us because they are not meeting sales goals yet they keep hiring and increasing the size of the workforce. So instead of having enough employees to run the store that work 35-40 hours per week they have way too many working under 30 hours per week. Compensation is woeful and annual raises are less then a dollar an hour. I started in 2011 making $8 and have received the best performance reviews possible and I'm making just over $9 now after almost 3 years. Target is best suited for young adults as a part time job while pursuing education or other career goals.
bad,"very busy, learning new thing each and every day, the management has drop down very poorly, i get along with all of my co-workers, I have a hard time with co-workers not seeing how I solve problems that they can not solve, I love the one on one with the guest"
bad,"good place to work if you get a manager that is willing to give you more then 4 hours per week, and let students go home for christmas. some of the management is AWFUL"
bad,"Unfortunately the hardships the company has had recently, has leaked into the basic store level. When I first joined the company, six years ago, things were fairly reasonable and management wanted to work with you."
bad,The management isn't very productive and its quite difficult to develop into manage. I've learned how to communicate better with my social skills and customer service skills
bad,My typical day at work is helping customers who want to exchange or return items some may have a receipt while others dont
bad,This job was a challenging job in a good way. It pushed me to strive and work harder to meet weekly quota. Friendly work place and everyone looked out for each other
bad,"Some of the ""Team Leader"" staff was outstanding. However some was not. Under Employee purchasing confrontations (under promotions - playstation 4), I found myself in a situation where I was placed under duress. Ultimately resulting in myself feeling as if I must quit my job in order to leave the store with my purchase."
bad,Terrible place to work please if considereding this company to work please don't I use to work at Distribution center in Midlothian first of all I had continue to have poor management or group leaders how they called them they pretty much ran by fear like slave plantation and the crazy part it half of the so called group leaders don't even what they doing the only reason the the job because they went to college. If you get employed by them u will see real soon why they hi turnover at the company yea the pay is good but that's not company were u will have long jeopardy and only people that last is the that kiss up  I just hope this touch someone from making a dession to work there
bad,There are way too many bosses. There is one who in particular who was rude and made many racially offensive  remarks. When I reported nothing was done.  Also to back up the too many bosses I have like three! One will tell me one thing and another would tell me something else which goes to a lack of communication. They do not work with you schedule which is important because I am a student. The wages are so LOW as well.
bad,"Coworkers and immediate managers were fine, but upper management like district, regional and corporate managers were not a pleasure to be around."
bad,"We picked orders all night long to go out to stores. Management harrassed the ""older"" workers when the younger workers were doing less than or equivalent to the older ones."
bad,"When I first started I was gung-ho and ""loved"" my job, however than I got sick, had to miss work but had medical documentation. I have been threatened that if anything happens I will lose my job. I don't think it's fair that while I haven't had a ""perfect"" attendance record thus far, it's not because I was playing ""hookie"" I was actually sick. I know they have to be ""strict"" with everyone, but when someone says she's going to vomit, don't you think that's a clear reason for them to NOT go to work."
bad,"Don't waste your time.  Kindergarten management at all levels.  Pay is at or below average levels.  Follows motto, expect more, get less."
bad,Target will not care about you no matter how long you have been there. You are just a number. Anyone can say anything about you and if they get to HR first that is who they believe.
bad,"I was a cashier at Target, so there wasn't much learning new skills. It was more about perfecting people skills which I believe I did very well at. I did not like playing the part of a salesman by asking every customer to apply for a Target credit card, but I still listened to my superiors and did the job that I did not particularly enjoy."
bad,Just an awful experience from start to finish. Management doesn't care that people have lives outside of work.
bad,I think this place has too many people working and getting hired and re-hired. There is not enough management for the workplace to have enough control. There are alot of chiefs and no indians. There are no reasons why people do get fired and there are no reasons why people get fired over the dumbest things like no communication or not smiling and not enough customers wanting to apply for a target redcard which is a credit card. This is a place where I don't recommend people to apply. This place is a big revolving door.
bad,"Help stock the store and maintain property. When you asked for help from management, they promised and never delivered. The coworkers were fun to work with and the hardest thing was dealing with an unhappy customers."
bad,management at the target I worked at is terrible.
bad,Management were egotistical fools !! So unfair and dishonest!
bad,They tell you how great of a company they are and how lucky you are to work there. This place is full of it they don't care about you or your needs just quota! The managers harass you and just don't care at all. DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME WITH THESE PEOPLE
bad,"As a pharmacist, there were a number of expectations that were levied against pharmacists that really challenged the ability to practice professionally. One of the greatest aspects of my experience was the opportunity to bond with technicians and other members of the sales floor. Some of my patients were absolutely wonderful, as well. The main problem that I experienced while working for Target was the fact that management kept pushing policies and practices that had no real beneficial impact on the practice of pharmacy. Unfortunately, they were after money and image, and the profession sometimes paid the price. Speaking reasonably with management about these things could not happen as they seemed only interested in making the policy happen. I felt a lot of backlash when I questioned the legitimacy of the practices, so be advised if you want to work for Target, you're going to have to take the practices hook, line, and sinker so to speak. On a more positive note, you did get 30 minutes for lunch as a pharmacist, but that really didn't seem to make a dent in the 12.5 hour workday I had. Rarely was my workday less than 9 hours. Target also should not allow new pharmacists to occupy the position of Pharmacist In Charge as that is an overwhelming post to start out, and for pharmacists who have no practical experience, their subordinates will suffer from their learning curve."
bad,"It was ok but they always seemed to be short staffed. In my experience, they do place any vaue on their team members. If you are over 50 yrs- forget about moving up."
bad,Their quota is overly rediculous. You only have two twenty minute breaks per 12 hour shift.
bad,"Outbound associates are worked hard and expected to do even more. Very physical and monotonous work. Only way to become a group leader is with a 4yr degree, past supervisory experience is meaningless unless you have the degree. Turnover rate is huge."
bad,was the worst job experience i have had. grumpy employees who caused endless drama. Would get multiple orders from multiple managers. Was going to start full time in shipping but the employees who had been there for decades complained constantly about me advancing in the store.
bad,Do not work here unless you need the money. The management is the worst and the pay is not good. I do no enjoy working here and I am looking for any opportunity to move.
bad,"can be creative with the uniform, colorful environment, working with diverse people, 30 min unpaid lunch break, long shifts, no career advancement in the beauty department, $13 per hr is low for the job duties required, management guidance is almost non existent, work independently about 85% of the time."
bad,Target was a great place to get a first job and it started well but the store i worked at was vicious and manipulative. I like shopping at Target and it can be a great place to work but make sure you find a store right for you.
bad,"Don't know where to start.  There was ZERO teamwork within the departments, my manager usually called me the wrong name, two members had set schedules despite everyone being told that was not possible."
bad,During my training days I was only trained one day after that one day I was left to figure everything out on my own my manager or team leader didn’t check to make sure I was comfortable or needed any help which made me frustrated it was hard for me to locate things and do a good job because I wasn’t trained properly and the managers were unorganized and unprofessional
bad,You do get good pay but the management/ Human Resources are insanely bad. The manager/supervisors micro manage and walk around with a pen and pad of paper looking for anything possible to flag you for doing something “not the target way” or “safely”  or more than 1 bathroom break a shift and the bathroom break has to be less than 3-5 minutes “MAX”. They do these type  of things to just be able to give you a bad review when it comes time for a raise. Don’t get me wrong not all of them are like that but I’d say %95 of them are. Also they have a very high turnover rate and are against you helping each other or talking
bad,"everybody messes with everybody, very unprofessional, a lot of drama, only gives hours to the team leads and they love to gossip or get you into nonsense."
bad,I was a former employee for a target in the Maryland area. My experience started off horrible and ended horrible. I was definitely looking forward to building and moving up in the company but the location was horrible.
bad,"It has such a negative atmosphere, employees always felt like they are walking on eggshells and we did our best to avoid or store manager and when we heard there was going to be a store visit from the district and regional managers everyone would freak out and we wouldn't leave work that night until hours well after closing."
bad,"The managers didn't know apples,etc!! The managers were rude!! Grocery line ...Nooo!!! I will walk 24 miles a day with my headphones and downhill ski all day!!!!!!! Shalom!"
bad,"I have been working as a General Merchandiser since March. During my interview they begged me to work at 4AM and I said YES little do I know that was a huge mistake. They work you so hard working early morning truck and you don't get paid good to do so. They will not even give you days off you need yet they have over 300 PEOPLE WORKING THERE along with seasonal people. Its like they don't even acknowledge your time off request. I'm always on time, never miss a shift or call in and they can't even give a weekend off. The only ""good"" thing about this job is how they practically shove the ""benefits"" down your throat that are given to you."
bad,You give them 60hours of your time for years yet in the end it pointless to them you’re always replaceable no matter how hard you worked they just don’t care
bad,"No room for growth unless your best friends with the managers/family members/ boyfriend/girlfriend, not based off how good you work or perform you're tasks,"
bad,Made to feel like you're a failure when struggling and you're made to feel like you'll lose your job every day when you arrive if you struggle. Bad working culture.
bad,"The management was very bad, I only had  one trainer out of the 4 days they had me working. They only want employees that work long hours and when i had a family emergency and was in the hospital, i called out of work they didn’t seem to care and because of that and asking to change my hours week before my next shift for my schooling (I talked to the head manager still didn’t help me) forced to quit"
bad,"I've worked at a few different Target locations and this one is by far the worst! 4 managers in a 4 year period, no team work, rude/unintelligent hr/team lead staff. They don't hold bad employees accountable and don't care about the people that actually care about their job. They treat every employee as a number instead of "
bad,"Worked grocery but had to do online orders ALOT and they expected you to help the customers and then nag on the walkie as to why you weren't done with the order yet..then the truck wouldn't get done before my shift was over most days because we had to do online orders at the busiest time of day..and they wouldn't stop. You get exercise because you walk all over the store. entitled looking for stuff but some of stuff would not be in location so you had to magically find it even though it isnt your dept. If you like retail, great! Go for it! If you are a college student you will like it."
bad,"Working for this company is very stressful. Management expects too much of you all at once and they never communicate. Manager 1 will tell you to do one thing and then five minutes later manager 2 will tell you to go do something else, and then manager 1 will get mad because the task they told you to do wasn't being done quick enough."
bad,Work life balance is nonexistent and there is little to no support on the job. The amount of work needed vs resources provided makes the job impossible.
bad,"Management (from direct supervisor upward) has no idea how employees efficiently perform their tasks.  When I left, there was no formal training program (though most positions require the operation of heavy equipment).  Employees that excel are those who are willing to find ways to cut corners and sacrifice quality, making the the job more difficult and unsafe for others.  The only communication between supervisors and staff is negative.  I got the sense that, behind closed doors, supervisors spent all their time defending their role or getting yelled at for poor performance in their department.  This hostility has created a culture of negativity and defensiveness.  Any attempts at cooperation between the workforce was perceived as loafing.  Job functions are all perceived as individual functions, and the assumption is that all factors when performing the job are equal (so, when performance is less than the best possible, then you must not be working hard enough).  I worked at Target for 19 years.  I was trained in every operational department.  I performed at the expected pace; but the hostility of the culture and the unwillingness to properly train new employees was more than I could bear to be a part of."
bad,"As a leader here, you will be expected to make up write ups, to disrespect your team, and get reprimanded or ignored when you contact HR. Store management laughs about firing people within earshot of other team members, and has no issue saying disrespectful things about the team, which creates a toxic and uncomfortable work environment. As a team member, you will only be valued for how quickly you can get things done in a short amount of time. Don’t expect hours though, unless you work multiple areas and want no work life balance. Team members at this location that have been here for years are treated like throw always, getting hours cut down to nothing so they can barely afford living expenses. Age discrimination is rampant  and thinly veiled under the guise of writing team members up for hear say reasons. This is sad because target as a company really tries to be great retail career. Sadly, so many team members have left this location due to disrespect from management, and added stress from these unethical practices. Unless they change out store management, I would not recommend working at this location."
bad,"Terrible management. Allowed the lazy to get away with wasting company time like being on personal phone near food not washing hands after use If you have a problem HR never helps, supervisor  never help  they look at you like the problem."
bad,The store Manager is rude and not a nice person to work with. It is a very hostile environment working for the store manager..The rudeness to the employees as well as the guest is very unacceptable.
bad,"Unless you are very close with leads or managers, you will get nothing. The company hires management with zero experience in the company and no business being in those positions. after years of covering shifts and backing up electronics I finally got the position but not until 2 or 3 people left and a lead supported it. The job is not the problem, it's all the bs and nonsense that you have to deal with. I've seen some of the biggest jerks get lead positions and systematically alienate everyone with their horrid way of dealing with people."
bad,I was alright in the beginning but then management showed they didn’t care it was about them and only them so I couldn’t last there much longer it sucked that they did that but I couldn’t deal with it any longer.
bad,"Atleast in my experience the management at target was really not good. the back room was a mess, there was never enough cashiers causing people working hard to have to come up and help slowing down their work"
bad,"Target used to be a decent place to work. Then they were going to pay their employees $15 minimum and started condensing down all the support/specialty teams. Training is nonexistent, leaders are all new hires or managers who don't work or help their teams. Store, district, and regional leads treat you like overpaid trashgarbage and if you need help the answer will be ""just figure it out"" then they'll fire you for not doing something righ"
bad,"the managers lack in communication when it comes down to a serious situation, managers have favoritism. No matter how hard you work, it will never get recognized how it should."
bad,"Target works or for some people and will not work out for others. They do not base promotions off performance, leading to incompetence in many positions."
bad,It was great when I started. I was hired on full time but I do not receive full time hours. I had been promised that a change would happen and hours would go up but this never happened and has been a year. There are some great people there. Our ETL's are great and my coworkers work very hard. I do not wish to paint a bad picture of the whole company. It's just changed as all things do.
bad,"I used to enjoy working at this store, the Trueman Blvd location. However, after ""modernization"" and a shift in store management it has made it an unbearable job. Managers go around the store harassing employees, timing their truck push, and belittling them over the walkie talkies. 13 dollars an hour is not enough to convince people to stay in an environment like this."
bad,I dislike working at Target...I appreciate  having a job but the management is unfair They think because they pay $13 a hour we have to put up with their attitudes while they just stand around and give orders.
bad,It was cool at first then you started to see favoritism  the team members are lazy and the guest are rude the hours are ok but at the end of the month schedules are cut to make management bonuses
bad,"very toxic environment. Starts off exciting but quickly became negative. Constantly told what you're doing wrong, no praises, always being threaten with termination. Many changes daily, and no communication. Store is always out of compliance due to in adequate upper management. Target has a very high turnover. They assure you 40 hrs but you are never scheduled 40 hrs. Hours are about 12 to 23 hours a week!"
bad,"The leaders and managers are rude if your a minor, on top of that they are unprofessional and don’t know the meaning of what it is to be a leader. The work environment is so negative and hostile that you don’t even want to go half the time. Most coworkers are cool and you get along great with but others just throw anyone and everyone under the bus. The work load is huge but with each each leader and manager they have different expectations so your never doing anything right. They’re lack of technology and training in technology is horrible."
bad,It was one of the best places to work train learn and be excited a to work with and for them they went through I complete change now you get in trouble for any little thing and everything you must break the sound bearer with your speed (not kidding) you must learn everything about your job in the first month or they will consider firing you next week they will tell you to your face that's ok it happens and stab you in the back later
bad,There is no communication within the company...if your direct manager tells you something and you go against them because their manager states otherwise...your direct manager writes you up and their manager presents you w/the write up like they didn’t direct you to do this action.
bad,The other Employees were great it was just the management that wasn't so great. They did not take into account if you had a family emergency and had to leave. They hold it against you and use it as an excuse to fire you.
bad,"Not really much opportunity to apply for a new position, until you work there for a certain number of years. They care more about selling credit cards than customer service. To me"
bad,i hated working at target. corporate does so much stupid stuff and the managers just eat it up and watch as their employees flounder around. managers expected you to do what you did in an 8 hour shift even in a 5 hour one. it was horrendous.
bad,I don't like the work ethic they like a bunch of work on you as soon as you come in and there is no training what so ever I am currently living in Yonkers and without asking your availability they throw you on the schedule the hours are good yes but not for a mother who has kids they will not change your shift if ask
bad,mostly all of the managers only care for themselves. Security does not care for the well being of the employees there! when you bring issues to HR they are not confidential and most of the time issues are not properly investigated. Its hard to learn anything there because no one is willing to to teach you how to do your job properly. Its horrifyingly unprofessional and the store manager is the worst.
bad,"Target used to be an amazing place to work,  until they did the modernization.  They took away hours and added extra work. The managers are very temperamental and will not take no for an answer.  The newest manager has had more than 20 people quit because of his abrasive behavior.  They claim to give you hours based on availability,  but it is really just a popularity contest."
bad,"Because I’m to slow I’m being singled out and  harassed  By my team leader and other team leaders turn a blind eye, the   Employees I work with are noticing how I’m being treated and think I should get a  lawyer or go to the head quarters. I thought target was a good place to work, the one in Petaluma, ca is by far the worse work place to work at. Just FYI"
bad,"drew vedik LOD at Caledonia target, Michigan is highly disrespectful making my last days there take a toll in my anxiety and depression. would not recommend to anyone that likes to be treated with dignity and respect."
bad,"Target was not my favorite place to work.  Management was very controlling and was not open to any new ideas or procedures.  Compensation was good, but the overall atmosphere of the building was unfavorable."
bad,These people dont care about there workers..they dont like black people and it shows..nothing more to add..if your looking for job security..dont bother
bad,"Target Manhattan Beach  Working at target they hate the great people who really like working at target And if your a employee who hates there  job at target.As a employee Guest Service  Team Member and  cart Attendant and On the Floor and on the FLOW Team or the Stockers on the floor they LOVE You when you can keep.tabs  on people as employess they be"
bad,"Useless District Facility Manager, no support and treat you like trash. If you ask for support he will get you in trouble. If he make a mistake, he'll put the blame on you."
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be to walk into a bunch of rollover stuff from the day before, and then I would be pressured and constantly reminded of all the work I had while trying to get the work I had to get done that day. It was a very stressful work place only due to the managers. The managers would try to fix a problem by only making the problem worse and blaming it on the team members. A mentally and physically exhausting job, wouldn't recommend to a friend."
bad,"Hired on as seasonal and promised a position once season was over. I had glowing recommendations from my peers. There was no specific management for my department after 2pm. I trained a majority of the other seasonal workers. I ended up acting like a department manager without the title. However, regardless of this one day I was 10 mins late during a snow storm. The HR woman was furious. I apologized and promised it wouldn't happen again and it didn't. Regardless I now have a mark on my profile and can not get another job with target."
bad,"For as much as you get there, it definitely isn’t worth the hassle and aggravation. I was there for a year and a half and I was still averaging 20 hours a week. When you ask for more hours, they never have it. They can’t budget their payroll and certain people get great hours while I was stuck with 9. No one can live off of that. They have favorites and it’s isn’t a place anyone should working for a long period of time. They don’t take care of their employees."
bad,"I was working a full time job and also worked at Target in the evenings. My schedule was never right and they had my shift starting when I got off from my full time job and had the nerve to coach me for being late when I specifically told 4 members of management more than once  when I can work and to change my schedule. After being accused of breaking company policies, I just quit. I realized that I would do just fine without them.realized gta"
bad,"Mixed messages from management that contradict each other in addition to having different standards for different people.  You are supposed to be in training yet they stop the training after 2-3 weeks and then wait until you are 9 days away from your 90 day probationary period to decide you haven’t improved enough and they are terminating your employment.  I loved the job but apparently was not up to par according to the supervisors who all had different issues...don’t pull the label, don’t stand behind the labeler, stack caddies safely with strong solid corners, spine, and banding. Which of course has different standards for each different zone you work in."
bad,"Was not allowed to balance two jobs despite that being a condition of my employment. Management gave me my desired hours for about a week before abandoning that idea. Further, working past your agreed-upon hours is expected daily. Myself and coworkers were subject to verbal abuse from a supervisor for following the schedule."
bad,"I worked at Target as a Front of Store Attendant (Cart Attendant) and Guest Advocate (Cashier) for a small amount of time. The Target that I worked at was in the red for sales and because of that every employee was cut to part time hours and had to do things we weren't trained how to do/couldn't do daily. "
bad,Coming into this job is probably the worst part of my day. I hate it with a passion and the management is the absolute worst. They don’t care at all about their employees and they believe their team members are 100% disposable and replaceable.
bad,"Poor work conditions, management doesn’t know the job nor are the able to help. Say they care about your well being but moving the product is more important."
bad,"Really racist, pick kind of people to work with or help forward those needed help most. Not hearing team member out if needed help. Leader was ignorant, aggressive per say.  And the paid is cheap, way to cheap for the amount of stand for over 7-8 of work, and only get a dang 30 minutes break."
bad,It was poor management. I was pregnant. And i didnt get treated fairly. I feel as if i got picked on. They didn't explain the rules and regulations. So i had a huge problem and called corporate because around Christmas season a customer bought a gift for me. I reported it to the boss cause i wanted to show i had a receipt. They took it with no explanations. And then tried find any reasons afterwards to terminate me.
bad,"Typical retail job, just so happens to be the worst one I have worked. The pay is good but the the amount of hours they give is nothing, can't live on 18 when I need 40. Was hired and told it would be 40 hours a week and would have every other weekend off. I have no weekends off and only get about 18 hours a week would not apply unless you are desperate."
bad,"Expect to go in and get to work, very stressful workloads every shift, always understaffed as well so I'd expect to go in and be ovetwhelmed from start to end of shift. Most members of management are great, they'll help with pretty much anything but they have impossible expectations. Things out of my control I feel guilty for even though it's out of my control"
bad,"The management here is terrible. They don't care about you or your feelings. One time I got sick at work and needed to leave early and my manager caught an attitude. The management is very disrespectful and they love to catch attitudes. The amount of work you do and what they expect you to do is impossible. They set their standards way too high. Co-workers are very disrespectful and like to be in ""groups"" like its high school. They like to talk behind your back and it's very childish. If they decide they don't like you, they will try and make you look bad every time the manager pops up. It's ridiculous. The work environment is overall very toxic. I would not recommend working here at all. Save yourself the stress and the trouble. It's also hard to advance here. The only way really is to switch to a different area and learn everything all over again."
bad,"Didn't really get to know any other employees.  Had no idea how to meet with my bosses if I had questions or concerns.  Received literally 20 minutes of training before I was on my own.  Way too much pressure to push those Red Cards onto customers, with no training on how to do so without being overbearing.  I did sell some, but pressure was always very high.  Job was extremely stressful during busy days, with little guidance on how to manage a lot of customers.  I would highly not recommend this job."
bad,"I tried and tried and tried for a job other than food or cashier. Yet I ended up in food cause they said they could not give me anything else cause I was 17 (lie). I told them i wanted to work 40 hours a week, they said no problem. They lied again cause I wasn't even getting half that. I could not pay my insurance or gas to get there and back. I would be the only one working the food counter and they would get mad at me cause I didnt take a 15 min brake. Then they wondered why I left after 2 weeks."
bad,"Target has great pay for this area, with a starting rate of 18/19 an hr! But unfortunately the cons outweighs the pros. "
bad,Depending on the store and management. Management is horrible. They do not care about you at all. That’s why there’s a high turnover rate bc of Management. But the Coworkers helped me make it through the day.
bad,"Over the past few years, Target has been on a self-proclaimed “modernization journey.” This has made many long-tenured team members reconsider their involvement with the company. Expectations are now at an absurd level. Team members are pushed to their limits by being expected to both acquiesce to any quest request and work obscene amounts of freight in short shifts. As a result, work doesn’t get done and guests are angry about empty shelves. Newer managers are instructed to micromanage every single aspect of day-to-day operations, and there’s little if any communication about upcoming changes. In short, I would never working for the company that Target has become."
bad,"Target as a whole is a wonderful company to work for. However, the company needs to do better about their retail level management teams. From the time I started to the day I left I watched management continuously suffocate the team's morale with bad attitudes, impossible expectations, and a disregard for the well-being of team members. Hours cut to the single digits, sometimes between 4-15 hours per week, for whole departments for months at a time, yet nobody in the store could tell us why we were left unable to pay our bills at a job that promised good pay and good hours at the interview. Management would make promises to gain new employees that they would then pretend were never offered at all (i.e. a reliable schedule). Terrible communication between managers would leave team members anxious when doing what they were TOLD to do, because there was no doubt another manager would come by and yell at them for not doing something nobody had even asked them to do yet. Cross-trained me at Starbucks because of my previous barista experience, but would punish me for assisting an understaffed Starbucks team when they needed it (our Starbucks team consisted of four people the entire time I was employed at Target). Managers disappeared for hours for their 30 min. lunch break. At Starbucks, we would be scheduled alone through our busiest days and ignored when we asked for help (which we were told to do) - I was alone for four hours on black Friday 2018 and was punished for shutting down for 10 minutes to restock, only after an hour of asking for assistance and when my fridges were all"
bad,"Was great in the beginning, they make you feel awesome and loved and then once you get new managers they treat you like you don't matter. They give you ten hours a week and still hire more people so they don't have to give people benefits. They will make you tired and run you ragged and still tell you your doing horrible."
bad,"The 4 am shifts were the worst being that I am a student. Very fast paced, quota to be met. The pay wasn't worth the work even for the  seasonal pay rate which is higher than the average pay."
bad,Lots of unprofessional people lots of drama and very little hours to go around. Mangers act like ur friend but will throw u under the bus to save themselves. Lots of hooking up. Alot like highschool but more mean girls. Mangers give out hours as a reward so got to kill yourself just to get 30 hours. Mangers lie about hour availability so they can offer favorites more hours.
bad,"Requires a lot of lifting heavy above your head, sorting, cleaning, not enough hours, no benefits,  not enough tools to accomplish what's asked of you"
bad,"working at highland park , illinois i regret  but love it same time i hate it every day small pay but willing work more hours  bad boss .    if i had to leave due to my kids was sick  it’s hard to leave  i got called in from home . no can’t tell the boss  wow  that’s where i had to walk away and leave my kids comes first before my job i’m sorry but geez ."
bad,"Management system is broken and in need of racial and sensitivity training. Human Resources is for the company and not the employees. Sadly this goes all the way up to corporate. Workplace culture is okay, very friendly team members and help is not hard to come by."
bad,Staff and managers are awesome as far as hr and store manager get on their bad side they’ll bully you into quitting or wrongfully terminate you. It’s good hours and great pay but it’s not worth the stress or pressure
bad,My managers were mostly alright. However hours are unreliable as they can never promise them... Pay is competitive and yet subpar as my management position required more work a double yet paid the lowest starting wage.
bad,we went to the back unloaded the truck downstacked everything on the floor stocked individually in different sections throught the store sorted repacks and Softlines then we went home worked super hard for low pay but its only four hours
bad,"Target was a great place to work when I first started but it's been on a speeding train into oblivion the past several months.  They increased the hourly pay, but decreased the average hours so we were actually making LESS after getting raises.  "
bad,Target made me feel unappreciated and invisible.  Pay raises were non-existent.  Typical day at work was fast-paced.  Benefits were non-existent.  Most enjoyable part of job was the friendly customers.
bad,"Becareful working here, if you voice your opinion you will be forced out by corporate higher ups. Your just a number, unrealistic goals, and finds a reason to get rid of unpopular voiced employees."
bad,"It's an ok place to work if you are under the age of 21. If you have a Serious bills to pay, and real responsibilities, you would need another job to make ends meet, depending on your state and cost of living."
bad,"This is a mediocre place to work at. Specifically the one i work for. Through 1 year, team leader of mine was replaced 4 times and there were long stints in which my department had to manager. Half the management does not actually work, case and point being previous STL of this site was fired for having skimmed hours of employees schedule so they can have larger checks."
bad,"Working at Target started out decently with what seemed to be a good foundation for career advancement and a stable work environment. That all changed with Target's staff and process restructuring otherwise known as ""Modernization"". From the moment this was introduced, the workloads increased drastically while payroll hours were cut across the board. Many teams that specialized in certain processes were completely eradicated and their work was dropped onto the remaining teams who got no extra hours to do the work, they were simply asked to work faster and more efficiently with the same amount of time to do three times the work. As a GM Lead, I saw how unrealistic these expectations were firsthand. I was expected to do my normal salesfloor tasks such as team management, salesplanners, floor fill, etc, but when our backroom/flow/planogram teams were dissolved I was also expected to do the work of the leaders that were in those positions as well without any increase in hours or people for my team. This led to an overall decrease in morale across my entire store and we lost leaders and team members one after another as ""Modernization"" continued. The store I currently work at obviously has too many leaders on the salesfloor for our Hardlines department as a Super Target has less than half of what we do, but our Store Director won't come out and say leaders will have to be laid off. Instead they are targeting leaders for ""poor performance"" to be rid of them without paying unemployment. All in all, Target has become a very shady business that I no longer would work for or recommend"
bad,"Everyone who worked there was friendly, however management is severely lacking and there are always mis communications. Its is very lonely on the sales floor and you are not allowed to work with others. They never schedule enough cashiers, so you will have to go up and help a few times a day, while the managers will still wonder why you never finished your task. Also you won't get scheduled enough hours and they often ignore availability."
bad,Don't take this job lightly you are there to work and hard . I enjoyed the work not the pain upper management gave me for reporting a injury. Oh yea don't get hurt you will be harassed.
bad,"At first, this job was easy. Actually had fun the first couple months..."
bad,Working at target isn't the best. There is never hours but they are salty hiring more people. 8 hours a week doesn't help me accomplish anything. Working t target causes you to live from one paycheck to another. After paying bills there really isn't any money that i can put side for savings. They expect you to go above and beyond but don't want to raise your pay
bad,"Enjoy the job. Very easy. Management is terrible. No organization. Not allowed to ask questions, voice opinion or give an idea. Treated like a robot and monitored for productivity hourly. If not up to manager standards taken aside and spoken to constantly. Very poor treatment of employees."
bad,"I was hired as a fulfillment associate. It was ok at first, I averaged around 16 hours a week and the pay was decent. But after black friday they only gave me four hours a week for the next couple of weeks which is not acceptable. I was told that I would at least get 15 hours but that was a lie. I would not recommend working here."
bad,"Target is a great place. The management and lack of leadership from management is what brings the company down. On top of the changes Target is making, they are forcing members and leaders, that has been there many years, to quit because they cant work with their schedule anymore! A typical work day is ok at times. But now I am forced to find another job because I don't have anyone to take care of my child in the evenings and they say it's mandatory I work the schedule or quit!"
bad,"The management is 100% corrupt. They will switch channels on the walkie talkie and talk about their employees in a negative manner. Also scheduling always goes wrong because HR just puts names into a machine in the computer and that’s how you’re scheduled. I was already planning on leaving because I was miserable there but I walked out because one of the newer managers (ETL) who had been there for a month or so, went to the backroom and started screaming at me and 2 other team members about how we weren’t working when I was training a brand new team member and the other was finishing up backstocking. Wouldn’t listen to us just yelled at us and threatened me when I tried to stand up for my team members. Horrible, horrible place. They will tell you, you can become a team lead and then tell you, you’re doing everything wrong and contradict themselves. Managers do “laps” around the store and don’t help out struggling areas."
bad,"I've worked for target for a while now and with the new management, and modernization this store has just gone down hill. More callouts each day than I've ever seen. Threats to take away your hours if you dont change your availability. It was once an awesome place to work but now it's just pathetic."
bad,"entry-level was most boring, tedious job I ever had. stocking, fronting. repeat ad infinitum. no hope of advancement (2 years average to achieve next level.  No training or advancement plan for associates. If you want to learn something, you must do so on your own. No leadership."
bad,the place i worked the managers were the laziest people that earned a high paycheck.  Only when the top officials were coming thru is when you actually see them on the floor doing work.  After that they were stuck in the office fooling around and doing nothing.  You would see them joking around in the store. Definitely not someone I would want to be. It was a fun place to work.
bad,"terrible like most corporations. The pay was pretty good, but they kept bumping up production requirements at a much higher percentage than any pay raises. They even lowered the starting pay for new hires after I left. Target is more concerned about diversity than quality."
bad,The particular store that I’m at it’s horrible they do not treat the veteran works well. We have had 4 different managers in the span of 4 years and each manager has a different way to run the store. And each manager we get seems more cut thoart then the other one.
bad,"Hated it. THE worst 2 years of my life, that I can never get back. Can't tell you how terrible it was to work here. Long hours and while they hire you for a management position, they'll hire another stores Supervisor's wife to be your 'manager', even though she has zero experience"
bad,Targets pay is undeniable I’ll give them that but they do not train you properly and will fire you on your second day if you do something wrong everyone seems friendly but will really get you fired they just play nice especially the managers ! Or OM’s they’re very unhonest when they offer you the job they make it seem like they make sure you get the proper training no if’s and or buts ! They don’t give a hoot about you being trained they throw you out there and if you screw up you fired !!!!! NOBODY TRAINS YOU !
bad,Negative environment. A lot of favoritism . Inconsistent work hours. The store was often messy and dirty. Many of my coworkers had very poor customer service skills and were never addressed.
bad,"There was not enough structure for someone as their first job.  There was no clear ""definition of success,"" so I felt lost a lot of the time.  Training program was thorough, but not thorough enough to actually learn how to complete the job"
bad,nothing here is good unless your comparing it to all bottom of the barrel jobs. Typical work day is me doing an overwhelming amount of work mostly by myself.
bad,"I worked for two different Target locations during about a two year span. There were some great people I worked with, which helped me get through some very long days. I worked on the Sales Floor primarily working in Electronics, but also worked as a cashier. I also assisted with the Sunday morning signage team (at 6am) and did that for quite some time. I briefly worked on the Plano team but found that wasn't a good fit for me. I learned how to  I found the job to be extremely stressful at times, and I felt underworked and underappreciated. I was not a full time employee usually working between 30-35 hours a week, but always felt like management was very impersonal with me when I worked there. There was one HR Manager in particular who was incredibly rude and never seemed to give me more than a minute of her time if I had a question about something. The work was very repetitive, and the job  became nothing more than a paycheck. I would STRONGLY recommend not working here unless you have no other options for employment."
bad,"Target is corrupt at its core. A person is not rewarded for competency and diligence. To rise the ranks at Target is to become as conniving and mischievous as those already appointed above you. People who don't want to become the monster they see in others should avoid working there, and customers should spend their money at smaller local businesses."
bad,I wouldn't send anyone with half a brain to the management cultural diversity running this warehouse. Telling an employee who was only holding a phone in their hand while not working around a piece of equipment and then firing them two weeks after the fact is just unAmerican and I wouldn't send a flee to work there.
bad,"Working at Target started out really fun. The pay is great and I love 95% of my coworkers and even some of my leads. But the high up management made me and several other workers have actual breakdowns ever other week.  "
bad,"Well, I wish i could say good things but unfortunately, they have some cons to work on. They should be more flexible on their hours. I remember telling them not to schedule me on a certain day and when i noticed i was scheduled, they told me find someone to cover it or i get written up. Same scenario happened to a coworker of mine. The management taught me a lot how not to be at an establishment. Instead of giving their current employees a chance to grow in the company and move up, they hired new people that really didn't know what they were doing. It isn't a terrible company overall, it just depends on location, in all honesty. The managers would hide in the office, eat, play on their phones, but yell at the employees for not getting something done in a certain amount of time. if they have time to stand around and swing their keys to the office, they have time to help unload a truck."
bad,"They pay you well cause you will be working in a toxic environment with an extremely high turn over rate. They do not care about your life outside of target or anything to do with your schedule. If you are looking to move up just forget it unless you are in the ""LOD CLICK"" people have been told they would get promoted for years being treated as leaders without pay or compensation or even appreciation."
bad,"My experience with this company was ok, it was a paycheck. The executives are miserable and seem to hate there lives. They are unprofessional and lazy!  The executives & team leads do not know how to balance the workloads with hours and team members. So to sum it up. When you work for a company and your executives/team leaders get pleasure from trying to ruin your own happiness it’s not a healthy place to be. "
bad,My overall experience with target distribution was horrible! The manager didnt care that i smashed my foot and said it would be to much work for him to do a claim. The people working there weren't friendly and honestly i would never recommend someone to work here.
bad,Worked for target for about a year now. Raises are insignificant based on performance advancement opportunities are nil. Management has lied to me and called out on it on several occasions. Incompetence runs rampant from a lack of training
bad,"running like______ if i didn't finish my job the management will be angry....don't anger the management, fast paced, alot of stuff to do, no time, customers to satisfy and not enough paid to be worth of a job."
bad,"When you find out that new employees were coming in and you only made $.80 more than them it’s kind of hurtful that’s why start looking for another job I’ve been there for 10 years. "
bad,Typical.  Very Underpaid for what i do...  Hard work gets you nowhere.  They are only looking for warm bodies to take up space.  If you are female dont bother.  You will go  nowhere.
bad,"I love shopping at Target, Couldn't stand working there. Super stressful. I've worked a lot of Retail, but honestly I wasn't there for even a year because of how they run everything."
bad,"This job is fairly simple it is by no means a career as you will not get paid any more than minimum unless you get promoted then you top out at about $16. The management is horrible as theres no communications between any of them. This goes a long way as managers dont have any control over the schedules because ""Team Captains"" approve and change schedule at their will. If you call out they make it seem like its your fault and if you cant find coverage they will call you to come in anyway. Also most stores only require 1 person to work at a time so your first couple of weeks will be tough as after the first couple of days youll be on your own and most of the job is learn as you go the online trainings just provide information on the products."
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal packer. It was so hot in the building I almost passed out. Management is condescending and rude. The trainers are all in their clicks, and they are snotty. Typical work day is very hard work, and a couple of times I went home with back pain that was so bad I couldn't work the next day. "
bad,"All the managers have let management go to their head. They treat you bad. I called a supervisor over while I was checking someone out and asked her a question and she replied, in front of the customer, ""I'm so tired of dealing with you people."" (Referring to the cashier's, I guess.) IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMER, I might add.  Neither the store manager or district did anything about that. In exchange they told that manager that I reported her or and she started making sure I got 14 hours a week and had to close Halloween, Thanksgiving (then come in six hours later for a ten hour shift,  10 hour shifts are NEVER  scheduled.) I had to close Christmas Eve. We were closed Christmas so I imagine she would have made me close if we weren't closed and I had to close New Year's. And their benefits suck. They don't cover anything. Oh and if you can't get someone to sign up for their Credit Card, your a bad employee who isn't doing their job. It was as though they wanted you to bully the customer into getting one. It was my fault if people didn't want their card!"
bad,"great concepts if people weren't involved.  big secrets. treat people poorly. rate the highest paid people and get rid of them.  very much like a high school click.  if you're not in the group, you won't make it"
bad,a typical day is going in getting yelled at for something out of your control and getting on with your day. Not having payroll for task given. No recognition given to those who work hard. Team leaders suck up to higher managers and get away with doing nothing all the time.
bad,"I absolutely hated it, they give off this “we’re such a team” vibe but it’s not true, at all. The management team sucks which only makes it less desirable to work there."
bad,Upper management do not communicate. They micro manage . You don’t get the opportunity to grow ! Management only communicate with whom they like . A manager was out sick with real bad illness and I heard upper management talking about them badly
bad,"fast paced,   busy at times, clean store. the hardest part of my job was the maintance of the whole store. i enjoyed collecting the carts.A typical day at work would be collect carts and clean the store."
bad,"Poor workplace culture where a typical work day involves much stress.  Executive staff is unprofessional and team members are not treated with the same respect as fellow execs.  This is not an environment I would recommend for anyone, long term."
bad,there is no room for growth in target unless you are a favorite of the manager. if you do by chance get in good with the manager the hourly pay is  good. but normally you want get enough hours to make money.
bad,"Unrealistic Expectations"
bad,"Typically, a general work day was stressful. Not because of the actual job but because of the managers. The upper management was awful. They wanted you to give all of yourself to the job but not get anything back. I remember new rules being placed that were not because of health inspectors expectations, but because management wanted a hand in everything that was happening. (no water, even water bottles, allowed on the floor or at the registers.) One particular experience I had was a manager yelling at me in front of coworkers and customers trying to tell me I had hit a meal compliance which was not true. I checked multiple resources to verify that I had not hit meal compliance. This particular manager would pick certain people and pick at them until they couldn't handle it anymore. My team lead was deflective and would place blame on everyone else if he got caught doing wrong. Texting you on your day off yelling at you for things that could have been solved with a simple phone call to the repair company. They didn't listen to requests off. So if you needed off you would have to find someone to cover your shifts in the end. You get a mediocre discount. 10% if you pay with cash or have the ""great"" Target redcard. They liked to keep the employees happy during the holidays because they needed us to work like slaves but the minute the holidays were over, the promised 30+ hours a week went to 12.  When I put in my two weeks notice to pursue my main career, they gave away more than twenty of my hours for the final two weeks of my notice. The last day I went to work, upper management"
bad,this place is not a good place to work managers are impolite its always about the work never about the employee..........................................................
bad,This is not the place you want to work at they have no respect for their employees. No matter how hard you work it goes unnoticed all they worry about is you working for them on holidays. The turnover ratio is HIGH! in other words choose somewhere else to work if u want a long stable job
bad,The company is well oriented but the management is horrible. There is no reasoning with them HR would provide the help needed but I’m not all cases where they are willing to work with. The pay is great but the pay isn’t worth it your productivity gets no recognition they want above and beyond more than what the company is asking. The man meant meant there makes the job very stressful.
bad,Target will use you and throw you to the curb. They push you till you are on burn out ant then tell you how you need to do better and get more credit cards and have better customer service. But they fail to teach you the correct steps to do so. I have only had one manager there that didn't treat their employees badly.
bad,Horrible starting pay. Raises so bad its insulting (7 cents a year). Awful management. Corporate is awfully rude. If you like terrible pay and corporate visitors who look at you like youre trash this is the place for you
bad,The management was always rude yelling at associates making for a stressed or difficult working indoor experience.  Will never recommend  target to any of my family or friends due to mnanagment or lack there of.  Managers  are unprofessional when speaking to warehouse associates
bad,Target was definitely my favorite place to shop & I was really excited to start working there. I turned down three jobs to start working at target & never heard back from them to know my schedule or get a hold of HR after the two days I worked which one was orientation & the other my training day. They never contacted me to let me know like they said after my second day working. As an employee and customer I'm very disappointed in Target.
bad,Horrible Corporation to work for.  Not heading in the right direction and cutting cost by getting rid of employees and not paying them what they deserve.
bad,I was told I would get 40 hrs if I opened my availability so I did and never got 40 hrs.it was horrible to work there. My schedule went up and down like a yoyo
bad,"Too much focus on corporate profits with little to no regard for it's employees at the store level.  College grads hired as executives, most without a degree in Business.  No advancement without a degree."
bad,The one and only thing they care about are the redcards. They will not cross train or promote you unless you are obtaining a redcard left and right. Unfair that you have to constantly harass people.
bad,"Some of the people I work with are cool which helps the job environment seem a little more appealing most days, and sometimes I get really bored with work."
bad,its all about how fast you can work. they will work ya till you get hurt on the job and kick ya to the curb. you can put in one year or ten they don't care.
bad,"I simply do not recommend working here in an attempt to move up or broaden your retail career. Upper management only pretended to really care for your improvement. There was one instance where I was realigning products on the sales floor after organizing most of the aisles in my designated area. One of my managers called me to one of the aisles I had worked on 4 hours prior, during the beginning of my shift. He pointed out to me that the aisle wasn't fully ""organized"". Here's the kick, only one product was not aligned, and that was most likely due to a customer moving the item..."
bad,"A place where souls die.There are too many folks talking behind your back within ear shot, managers playing favoritism, and ridiculous expectations from higher ups. No one cares about your well-being. Money is what matters, you are just a slave to them."
bad,"i got carts "
bad,clock in head to the back to help unload the truck sort items to be stocked in the store stock the shelves with merchandise before store opens the management was hardly ever in to help with the store setup before corporate came they barely gave good hours until they needed to rush and get the store together then u could work as long as you wanted hardest part was being held responsible for doing a managers job but not getting the managers pay enjoyable part was working with different co workers to make the time go by faster and the job done
bad,"Nothing was kept confidential at T2010.  Managers managed from their desks in the offices and would walkie talkie orders.  If someone called in sick, they did not replace the shift and did not come out of the offices to help.  It was frustrating to see guests standing in a growing line."
bad,"Enjoyed my time spent with Target. Although the pay rate and hours worked were definitely something i was not happy with, I did enjoy coming to work with people who were employed there."
bad,There was lack of communication amongst leads/supervisors as to who was borrowing you momentarily to help organize a section. This would result in issues. Training was also non-existent. You would just found out things as you go.
bad,"great coworkers. you have some good people who shop at the store and not so good people. your hours will get cut depending on the time of year. management is not always so great,"
bad,A typical work day involves scanning in trucks full of freight to put on to shelves. Once everything is scanned in then the flow team stocks the products. When the store opens at 8 a.m. customers are allowed in the store and we provide the customer service if demanded upon.
bad,"Target does not strive for progression nor do they value there employees"
bad,i worked in the mornings as a flow stock clerk. worked well and liked it until they pulled out of Canada putting me out of a job. i learned to use a basic scanner gun that is used to receive most inventory in most places.
bad,"This was probably the easiest jobs I've had. and It was a good place to start. Because of the competitive pay, workers tend to stay longer than first expected. The pay was the only reason I didn't quit any sooner. I cannot express enough how terrible management is here. The communication is awful and there is little to no room to promote. A bad place to be more than a year."
bad,"It's kind of luck of the draw whether or not a day is going to go well at this job.  Most days, it feels like Management is desperate to keep things well in hand by punishing entire staff for the faults of only a couple of workers.  Cutting hours, not delivering on promised benefits, accusing employees of poor behavior when they've done nothing but their job...there is very little to enjoy about this place save for the fact that the busy work does keep me busy, there are a couple of coworkers I do not mind and I can listen to music while I work."
bad,"Working at target was not very good because they were always cutting down on hours, the annual review/raise was max .35 cents and benefits were no good."
bad,"The company is never wrong. Production numbers constantly going up. A box is a box. Team lift boxes still count as one. Rate is 4620 boxes a night in trailer and normally runs much faster. Pay is good, insurance is pricey copay. Overtime sucks and mandated in fall for shift of your regular work shift. No bright spot besides hourly wage. Not a friendly culture for the workers"
bad,I personally wouldn't advise anyone looking to grow and advance within a company to apply here. Management is not good to say the least and your forced to work up to 6 days a week with minimal notice. Benefits sucks only positive is the pay per hour
bad,"poor management. most employees are rude and disrespectful to customers. i enjoyed helping the customers and getting them through as quickly as possible so they can get back to work, continue there day, etc. I have seen terrible customer service provided by other employees. supervisors are very unprofessional. would cut or shorten employees breaks."
bad,"Management is nothing short of incompetent."
bad,"There was no work/life balance. I worked 60-70 hour work weeks but my benefits were based on 40 hours. When I started with the company it was a great, friendly place to work. They cared about their customers and their team. As time went on they cut jobs and started to pay less and less."
bad,Inexperienced executives at the store level cause disruption and confusion. There are seldom enough manpower resources available to complete the huge workloads that such a large store requires to remain in stock. Moral amongst the team members is poor and stress levels are unhealthy.
bad,"Target is a corporation that looks great on paper and treats it's employees like slaves.  I have never been treated so poorly at any job in my entire life.  The other miserable, yet wonderful people that I worked with were the only thing that kept me there."
bad,Horrible management they lie to there employees. They only care about numbers that are not attainable every single day. Hardly any diversity. This company is a revolving door. New management is needed immediately.
bad,"The job was good, but the people in charge is where the problem is. They expect too much of you even when you are doing your best. They push and push you. They will threaten to send you home as punishment if your numbers aren't good enough and they will fire you for being too slow after a month. Their managers suck. Coworkers were great. I liked all the exercise I got while working. I was constantly walking for 12 hours picking things for orders to be shipped out to customers."
bad,I do not have a review at this time. There is little to no work life balance. The hours are very long and the job becomes very strenous.
bad,"I had the worst experience working for Target. My direct supervisor was unable to understand the scheduling software necessary for her job, and as a result it was almost impossible to balance my life."
bad,The only thing i really enjoyed about this job more than anything were my co-workers. The team working was great. we all got along perfectly. The company was very assertive it was pretty different for me.
bad,"It's alright, but I wouldn't waste my time.  More of a college than a business.  I don't think they use their talent to power potential."
bad,"*yelled at by customers"
bad,"poor management, too much favoritism, absolutely no room for growth once you are in a position thats it, horrible raises."
bad,"Definitely can find a better retail environment at nearly any other major retailer in San Diego, CA."
bad,"As my first job as a pharmacy tech I expected some challenges but this place was overwhelming. Never enough staff, no leadership."
bad,"I entered this job with the impression that my duty was to tend to carts. I was soon bombarded with the responsibility, of hourly bathroom checks, trash duty, and zoning. All of which were NOT included in my job description. Everyone else in the store seemed to chill and not even bother to help one another unless they know you personally. Moreover, they treated cart attendants like indentured servants. They rushed me all the way from the back of the store to the front of the store NONSTOP. Whenever I genuinely needed assistance and called on the walkies, nobody would pick up. Whenever I didn't respond via walkies, however, it was a HUGE issue. Long story short, the T in Target is NOT for team."
bad,Company values how you manage upwards more than the results you deliver.  If you can be political and have more superficial skills than any substance you will thrive at this organization.
bad,"Management was unorganized with no communication skills. "
bad,"For me I was polite and courteous to the guest making sure everything was okay."
bad,not really anything special. gives retail experience and income while looking for other positions. i would not recommend.
bad,"I worked at target for about 6 months and I have never seen a more poorly run company. The management does not allow for innovation at work, and therefore employees must adhere to a strict, outdated, and inefficient work style. Management would become angry if you deviated from assigned tasks. (for example as a backroom member I was not allowed to help guests to the parking lot if the ""pulls"" weren't finished, but many times I would be required by the Team Lead at the registers to help someone out only to be yelled at by the store manager or my Team Lead. If I didn't help the guest I would be yelled at by the Team Lead at the registers and my Store Manager.) Needless to say I was constantly getting in trouble for doing what I was told. "
bad,"The work at Target is fairly routine: stock the shelves, straighten the shelves in your designated area, do reshop for your area until you are told you can leave, all while helping the cashiers when they get behind and helping needy, ungrateful, rude customers. The management is by far the worst part of the job. Huge problems with micro-managing and a general passive nature toward anything the lowly ""team"" members have to say. However, the co-workers will more than likely be the best friends you ever have because you will all suffer together. My overall opinion is it is a greedy corporation with overpriced merchandise and a disrespectful nature towards its customers, but more so its employees."
bad,"As ETL (Executive Team Leader) witnessed first hand the culture and motivation of Target Canada. Its no surprise that the canadian locations are failing miserably as the American culture Target has driven into the staff is not ""fitting."" This starts within the store at the Store Manager position but is easily seen in the DM, the Resources (from out of store) and the drone HR dept."
bad,Was good at first then changed DMs who wanted me out its either her way or highway stay away from this job while shes in charge she brags about being in prison and being a former cocaine addict its obvious they dont run background checks its obvious she still uses again with outrages and yelling during your so called coachings.
bad,"There's a reason for all of the issues at Target"
bad,I love the retail interactions but the superiors lacked communication and didnt work well with schedules. everything but the retail experience was awful
bad,the long hours short amount of time to get orders out to customers
bad,Only popular people will advance.  Majority of the time spent on non-value added activities
bad,i was unloading the truck and stocking i also learning using a PDA
bad,"Management thinks of team members as a number, not person. constantly short staffed. co workers are nice, mostly. hard to put an entire box on the shelf in 1 min, neatly and organized with no trash or stickers around. coworkers made the job fun, that and listening to music since there were no customers."
bad,"The only good thing was they paid more than minimum wages. I liked that it was earlier then my other job, so I could work there then go to my 2nd job. But not everybody is as fast as management wants them to be. I hated working in the freezer because I  would have to thaw out every 30 minutes"
bad,I would like to explore my options for consistency in hours with a company that I can learn and advance with while earning a comfortable living.
bad,"Target was a fun place to work because of the people I worked with, other than that there was no room for advancement and management was not involved in the team environment as much as they should have been"
bad,Management at my location had favorites they chose from the beginning. Often time would separate the work load unfairly especially in holiday season give the same people the revealingly harder sections of the store. Seniority played a big part and was unfairly taken advantage of by those that had more years working to get earlier shifts and constantly steal sales. Also pay is not anywhere what it should be for working in this retail job. MODERN DAY SLAVERY
bad,alot of snakes at this company if your not in a click it could cost you your job.
bad,The most enjoyable part of my work day was when I had to fill catering orders for customers.
bad,"The company was badly managed."
bad,"terrible place to work, don't provide hours and put many into debt and try to force people to quit instead of firing them or talking to them up front."
bad,"very fast pace, military style, all about numbers, felt like competition between employees"
bad,"This company was completely void of any ethics, moras,l or integrity. Comletely missmanaged, With a company policy of absolute seperation of management and employee with turnover rates as high as 300%. Target management consistantly ignored and missused   standard corporate practices, resulting in complete failure. refusing to accept reposibility, they randomly went after any and everyone. Many, many times I first hand watched them completely fabricate reasons to go after, and fire people. In my 6 years at Target, in a department of 20 or so, we lost over 16 supervisor. I would not recomend this place to anyone for any reason. I quit target in 2012, so this is based in fact not retalliation. "
bad,"At first I loved working here, meeting new people and loving the fact there is advancement within the Target corporation. Well a year later I was wrong. Favoritism is the only way one advances you ( you have to be good looking and oh need to get your RedCards!), if you speak out for what you believe in your hours are brought down. This job is perfect for teenagers who don't want anything over 20 hrs per week. The management is a joke, the front end GSTL/LOD keeps the minors so he can flirt with them, the GSTL is on a path of revenge against the new LOD/GSTL and no one actually cares about their employees. If you have an issue they rather write you up then ask what truly is bothering you. Then they ask questions what can we do to help you, it goes over their heads. Why should they care if you are struggling when they already have their advancement, hours and pay."
bad,a good first job experience only. lots of work with less hours . only good on holidays thay feed you.
bad,"this is the worse place to be that I have ever work, free slave labor, the pharmacist did not teach me a thing. the pharmacy techs treated me like I was trash, dumb. I was pulled out of this store before my internship hours were done."
bad,"Looks are so deceiving when it comes to Target. First of all, the amount that they pay cashiers should be illegal. You're check will look like gas money and maybe a couple of McDonald's meals after two weeks of working your butt off. You have to be a salesman as well and sell Target credit cards which annoys customers. Your previous experience means nothing. You get the same pay as the 16 year old. I'm not even gonna talk about the nickel and dime annual raises I heard about. If you're seasonal don't get sick or die because there is no health coverage. Breaks are pathetic because you never go on time. Human Resources and management are the biggest liars and fake people you could ever meet. You are just a number to the ETL's and store manager. They look right through you like you're nothing especially if you're seasonal. There is alot of favoritism so if you kiss up to management, you can stand around and let the hardworking people do the work and not get in trouble. This company is a real joke!"
bad,while working at target there can be some high moments but the management makes it a low enviroment to work in
bad,"I learned many things at Target such as the proper way to set a planogram, set sales planners, set up and take down the ad for the week and how to pull items from the backroom. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting and getting set tasks done in the required time, however, the was the most enjoyable as well. Being busy makes the day better. My co-workers were great to work with. A typical day would be when I got there would talk to the team lead and get my instructions and go about doing the tasks of the day."
bad,Great job. Fast paced. Friendly people to work with. Managers werent to friendly.
bad,"I start at 7am and I first check my email and attend the mourning hurdles. Make sure the clerical are completing their tasks, so I can continue mine. All manager was monitoring the floor while the STL and all ETL are attending their everyday meeting for severals hours determing who going to get termed or promoted. I order their lunch and then clean after the meeting was over. Sometime I did my supervisor personal shopping."
bad,"I feel like management don't care about the employees. I want to advance in a career with Target, but I was turn down I had ask over 3 managers. I have over 10 yrs experience in management in I graduate in 3 months. This is a sad experience for me I rather go somewhere else where the management care about their employees!!!"
bad,"The company is run by corporate idiots that came from Walmart, that is why target is the new Walmart, and Walmart is the new target(they do not deserve capitalization).  The working people at target are for the most part wonderful, good hard-working people-that I do miss."
bad,They have followed the path of many companies and fired all their full time employees because the didnt want to give the hours or pay for benefits. Not worth your time.
bad,"Often times target portrays a family like environment but in reality it is all a lie. The management is a reflection of the store, which is poor and fake. The work environment is understaffed which is norm, where there is high expectations for current “team members” aka laborer because of an 13$ salary which is more than earned. Often management is not present leaving the store in the hands of incompetent team leads."
bad,"Target was an alright place to work but the hours suck and its alot of bs you will have to put up with especially HR."
bad,Don’t get too comfortable do what u have to do n get out just be careful with customer n co workers . Come on time get just done . Take care customers.
bad,I took on the responsibility of receiving clerk and was promised my position back on the floor once we hired another person but that didn't happen. I got sick while working as the receiving clerk being exposed to the elements and was let go before my health coverage could kick in because they were behind on their paperwork.
bad,The target store as a whole was a nice place to work but when you got to know people and how it really operates you see that management talks behind your back and everyone’s back and there is no room for improvement it doesn’t matter how long you have done something you need a miracle or a death to even be considered to move positions and if you do carts god bless because the amount of work load they put on a single human in unreal and should be illegal they will run you like a slave with no remorse
bad,"I enjoyed the work itself and a few of people but did not like management, we had no support for issues we wanted and there was a lot of hypocrisy. When I left we had 9 people quit in the previous 2 weeks, that will tell you how it was."
bad,Not worth the money for the effort involved one of the management leads was insane had many Hr complaints against her and nothing was ever brought up.
bad,"Awful working experience. I could go into detail about how no one does their job, leaders can't make their minds up on anything and find it acceptable to lie to guests, or how you'll be lied to about an urgent problem of yours that they caused is going to be fixed while it sits on their desk for weeks but I don't have nearly enough characters. Trust me. Don't work here. Go somewhere else."
bad,"this was not a good place to work at in my opinion. it was a negative environment and i had to leave the establishment due to management and unbelievable work standards. a typical day at work for me would be a being pressured. There would be some days where i had to skip my break because they were stressing me out to finish  my work load that i always finish before i leave. they expect you to push a box a mintue, but they dont take into consideration for a lot of things like help customers, the boxes on your cart that are located down different aisles. how heavy the items are(im a small person and worked in pets) so it takes a little longer to push the cart to your destination, back stock, breaking down your boxes and putting them in the baler. work is supposed to be something id look forward to coming to everyday, if i want to plan on being there for awhile. not a negative atmosphere where it feels like you cant breathe because someones always at your throat checking to see if you mess up even once then they get on your case. i remember id always most of the time get  two medium sized palettes and 3 carts one being litter(and that was a mediaum sized cart) and they expected me to finish in an hour and a half. its ridiculous everyday."
bad,"VERY unprofessional, mean spirited individuals. Daily stress gets to management too easily and they don't listen to team member concerns about workflow. Work is often tossed around and dumped on others' loads. Closing shifts with opening shifts the following early morning are extremely common and it's a very negative work environment."
bad,"I was hired as a full time employee 40 hours and when I got my schedule I received 17.50 hours 1 week and 35.75 the 2nd week. So, I went out to get a job that paid me for full time work and they told me that I couldn't change my schedule for 90 days. That was never stayed in the orientation. So, I was told that I would be terminated if I didn't work the schedule that I was given."
bad,"Bad hours, decent pay, so it’s fairly contradicting if you ask me. The people weren’t bad, I enjoyed working with my regular co workers, but the management was very poor."
bad,"Not a great place to work, some coworkers were nice but others were just rude and the managers seemed to be not as engaged in their work as I hoped they would be."
bad,"Job itself was decent.  Nobody likes any of the management team, and for good reason. They put a bunch of children and operations people into maintenance role with no maintenance experience.  Only thing keeping the place running are the mechanics that had been there since day one. And to top it off, they will lay you off on your last day of probation with no notice or valid reasons."
bad,It was horrible working there. They expect too much for little pay. They don’t treat you with respect and don’t care for your wellbeing. The management was terrible and the store was always a mess but of course they blamed us when they never scheduled enough people.
bad,Dont do it unless you want low hours new modernization process has screwed everyone in getting hours an expect about 15 hours of work done in a 5 hour shift
bad,"I applied to Target after seeing their starting out pay for new employees was $13 an hour and then would be increasing to $15 an hour by 2020. It was a very enticing entry level pay and beat every other job starting pay in my area so I applied. After a couple of days not hearing back I called the store and finally got into contact with the hiring manager there and they scheduled a in person interview. I got to the interview and the questions were very easy (what would you do in this situation, are you a team player, etc...). The interview was then over and I was told I would have to go through two other interviews before I got the job. The next two interviews were very simple and fast and eventually I reached the end of it all and got a job offer for a part time (keep PART TIME in mind - we will come back to it) cashier role in their store. I was very happy because I was told I would be getting 20-25 hours a week and at $13 an hour that is pretty good pay per week."
bad,This started off as a really great place to work. My leaders and coworkers were all very friendly and easy to get along with. I have even made a lot of very close friends while working here... but with that being said I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you’re okay being completely disrespected and disregarded by your superiors. The management has taken a complete turn for the worst since first starting here.
bad,HR has a gossiping problem and I had my direct manager tried to get me in trouble on my day off. Management is completely and totally useless. The heart and functionality of this corporation are the worker bees. Great if it’s your first job because you could only go up from here.
bad,"we had one amazing gstl, she was my absolute favorite person to work with. a few good lod's but for the most part management throughout the entire store was garbage. the hours were fine, the pay was fine for the work i was doing, but the way employees were treated was awful. its clear they only care about management and money. nothing else matters."
bad,"I take pride in what I do but the culture of the store is more of a popularity contest.  The managers from the top down are rude and degrading.  The HR person is never there and when she is she is unbelievably rude and many complaints to corporate have been filed and they do nothing.  They claim people are the most valuable asset however they are treated extremely degrading.  I am one of the most tenured persons there but because I'm not rude and lazy I've been told I will never be promoted.  How unfair is that?  I'm dependable, reliable and hard working but that isn't good enough.  I do feel however that when I complete a task or am able to help a customer in need it gives me a sense of pride and accomplishment."
bad,Coworkers were nice meet some cool fun people. But company is all about themselves. Never got a raise. They would give out raise before minimum wage would go up. So know matter how hard you worked for them you never got rewarded for it. Higher ups in the store offered me other positions but never followed through with them. Basically company didn't care about workers that much.
bad,"Working at target  it’s a great place to work at friendly atmosphere. It does get stressful at times but also manageable. The problem that I’m having is that there are more management then employers there. They can occasionally  be rude or tell you to refer your concerns / questions to a GSTLE or just a floor manager. Their rules are harsh , and they complain /  reprimand  at the ones that can do the job .Insecurity there is a joke."
bad,"The new ways target has decided to take advantage of it's people is cutting hours in HALF and asking you to do double the work. It used to be a wonderful company to work for the past 15 years, sad to see it turn into this monstrosity. But dont worry you get paid more... but with no hours. Horrible place"
bad,"The poor job security comes from a specific example for me, my old boss was suddenly let go after years of working for Target just because modernization meant they needed one less manager. They did not offer her another position, and they only let her keep working until the assistant manager was back from his vacation. The management has unrealistic expectations when it comes to how long tasks take, often loading a multitude of things to do onto you, even if doing those things means needing to stay for hours after your scheduled time. Putting tasks onto one person when it would be better suited for multiple, unclear instructions, low amount of training, and being generally uninterested in hearing ideas for ways to do things better all make Target a bad work environment to be in."
bad,The culture is toxic. There is too much politics played here. There is no rhyme or reason for someone who gets a promotion. Some Operational Managers plays favoritism and will try to get a person fired if they do not like you.
bad,"A typical day at work is stressful and filled my body with a uncomfortable feeling all the time. I learned how to stock shelves and take inventory from the back. The work place culture was filled with hate and competition, which i didn't enjoy. The hardest part of the job was directing customers to the correct isle during the remodel target under went."
bad,"Poor management, not appreciated, no opportunity to advance. I wouldn’t recommend this job unless it was your last choice so you’re not unemployed. It’s not fun to feel unappreciated and disrespected by management and be in a situation where there isn’t much you can say or do because they’re over you."
bad,"The STL and ETLs lead the team by use of intimidation and bullying."
bad,They suck at giving hours. Lack of hours means no help in the department you are in. They think a 4 person workload should get done by one person in a decent amount of time and if not you get yelled at. Management acts like a bunch of teenagers and they stand around and talk all the time.
bad,"Would not recommend as a suitable workplace for the “long term” minded individuals looking to make a career in retail. Working for Target I’ve had my fair share of good, and bad and couldn’t explain the bad without first going into the good."
bad,"Nine times out of ten, when you go in to start your shift, you're more than likely going to be sent to a different department from your assigned shift, to make up slack that previous shifts left behind. After getting said department adequately caught up, you'll be sent back to your assigned area, only to be asked not 15 minutes later why you're so behind in your tasks. Dare to explain that you were helping out another department, per the orders of another manager, you'll be shut down and told that your excuses don't matter, and to get back to work and stop wasting time. This cycle will repeat itself throughout the work day at least two or three times, and the management staff will talk with each other about how you need to be monitored. Your breaks will never be the fifteen minutes they say it will, and they'll threaten disciplinary action if you use the restroom more than once per shift."
bad,They want full time availability but schedule you random short shifts that dont cover the cost of living. Its a good job if you shop there and you can get the discounts. Its the kind of job you get when you really need a job til you find something better.
bad,"While I've enjoyed working with my fellow team members and have built strong relationships with many of them, it is not a place I want to be so I am currently looking for another job. Management is VERY poor. Their scheduling/time management is extremely poor, and often times do not give enough coverage in the correct areas. Sometimes they do not work with your life schedule, such as if you have school or if you are a parent."
bad,"I was a cashier for only 3 weeks and that was enough time for me to see Target's true colors. The location I worked at had a terrible cashier/front lanes manager, schedule was all kinds of horrible (only one off day in a 10 day span), I was left out and felt like an outcast even though I worked hard and was very friendly to everyone. The customers are extremely rude and act entitled. It was stressful and mentally taxing to be riducled by customers all day over material items. When it wasn't busy, it was the boredom that killed me. It was painfully boring standing in one spot when customers weren't in your checkout lane. "
bad,"Target is a corporately owned retail business that bases all of its stores, big or small, on their largest store with the most payroll, foot traffic, and employees. The expectations to meet timelines with the amount of work given and payroll allotted is unreal and there is no way I'd recommend Target to anyone. The other problem is with any retail store, Target is Corporately owned by asshats who have never been inside the very store they run. It's idiots fresh out of college who and just bigwigs that don't even know what it takes to run the individual stores."
bad,"Managers are not friendly and have unrealistic expectations. Very fast pace and stressful, which did not make the pay for the amount of effort required and mean bosses."
bad,"Overall, the amount of time that I was pushed to complete was terribly unequal to the job I was given. In the morning (4AM), you are given the task of unloading and sorting the products off of the trucks. Then, it's pushed to the floor, where it is given its place. These tasks are menial, boring, and are made to be done as quickly as possible. You are on a clock, and the managers pay attention to it, so although the tasks you are given are ridiculously simple, you have an extra level of stress. Additionally, each side of the aisles are made to be worked by only one person per, so you are solely responsible for your time."
bad,I worked at target for a year or two and the management is not too great. The managers are very strict and very rude. Not all of them are like that there are a few nice ones here and there but the higher up managers are not so friendly. Coworkers are great zero issues with any of them but getting hours are awful!!! Target has great hr pay but without any hrs it’s usless. I’m working less than 10 hrs!!!
bad,"Co-workers gossipped, management rarely paid attention to team members.  Team Leads would micromanage, an injury is not taken seriously. I was injured, taken to fill out an incident report form and asked if I could go back to work."
bad,This target needs to clear the house. Mostly all the managers and LODS are racist and will treat you poorly if you aren’t white or suck up to them and they WILL rush you and talk behind your back on your so called “training period” for 5 days. I didn’t even get trained right and no one cared! I had to ask question after question with different employees telling me they know the training is terrible here. They will fire you for not being trained right that’s exactly what happened to me. I would not recommend to anyone expecting some time to learn the ropes.
bad,"I worked from two different Targets, I worked from a target up in austin bees cave and the way management had run was outstanding, great team work, the managers would help their team, they helped each member move up and learn more, however the target at Alamo Ranch district, the management was awful they basically didn't care about their team, they are rude to them and disrespectful and unencouraging, no matter how hard you tried they found away to make you feel less at that job, the jobs were easy and as long as you work your best you were sometimes okay but even then target all around seems like a good company and it was definitely a place I wanted to grow in until i transferred to another site in the San Antonio alamo ranch district."
bad,There was nothing enjoyable about this job whatsoever. they expect you to do so much when its just you at times I feel like this should be a 2 man job. and like you only get a 10% discount.
bad,Management didnt know what they were doing. They didnt respond to criticism correctly. They would say it's not my job. They dont know how to train people.
bad,"Management is very rude, not understanding, and only cares about themselves. If you're not dripping in sweat, they will pull you into their office and tell you that you're not working hard enough. They don't care about any issues you have."
bad,"I worked for South Hills Village Target in the Pittsburgh area for nearly year.  It was meant to be more of a temporary thing, but the job market for my specialization was few and far between."
bad,"The only thing I enjoyed about working at Target were my fellow cashiers. Many of the ""guests"" were rude and pushy and the new HR is horrible. I would have panic attacks before my shifts and I honestly can't remember the last time I had a good shift. I would never work or shop at a Target ever again. Good riddance!"
bad,This was one of my first jobs directly out of high school. I didn’t tend to work here for over eight years. So I went through a lot here and didn’t like the outcome.
bad,"Very frustrated with management and opportunities within the company. Lack of communication between the stores and corporate as well as between Etls,tls, and team members. Unequal treatment, such as favoritism."
bad,"Most stress full and disrespectful  retail management I have ever experienced. Constant unnecessary motivational harassment.  "
bad,They hurt a lot of people.  We worked our butts off for them and the senior U.S. management were completely at a loss as to how to run a business in Canada.
bad,"Horrible place to work, the executive management is not team players, they put a lot in their managers and employees while they sit back and relax. I would never recommend anyone to work here unless it’s a tempor situation"
bad,"The company pays very competitively, it gives regular raises to its exempt and non exempt team members. That is how you get stuck. Target does not care about well being or work life balance at all. Do not apply if you like holidays, you will not get to celebrate them for your time at this company as you are forced to work nearly everyone of them."
bad,My position at Target was Holiday Seasonal.  I had no idea who my supervisor was.  The people there were not friendly.  I would not recommend working here to anyone.
bad,unloading trucks everyday and also had to do sometimes two trucks in one night it was very hard on the body and i could have messed up my back. refused for me to go day side due to great productivity. Will never do it  again.
bad,"Start your day by signing up for your work station. Then you go there and start working right away. There was nothing to learn, Just repetitive work packing product in boxes. Management brow beats you for not making numbers even though the product you received didn't make it easy to make them. Workplace culture was very negative. Hardest part of the job was dealing with all the mental abuse you had to deal with each and every day. You could be busting your butt but no good job or thanks for trying. Most enjoyable part of the day was leaving at the end."
bad,"I was the best worker there and was still asked ""Are you done yet?"" everyday as was everyone else. I stayed one year in hopes of getting FT hours as I was so liked and a hard worker only to get less hours when new hires had to get their share of hours."
bad,I had no issue working at the store until i realized my hard work didn't matter. my team and i busted our butts throughout the holiday season and kept the stock room organized but starting at the beginning of the year our hours were cut dramatically. i couldn't pay rent and live off of less than 30 hours a week. the management there does not have your back and does not care about your well being. HR didn't care about my dying family member and my need to be there for them but worse was when one co-worker of mine was verbally and physically abused by a manager. she made an official complaint and talked to HR but she was essentially ignored. it just kept getting worse until she finally quit.
bad,The management sucks!! I have worked there for 2 years and things have just gotten so bad! I used to love working there untill the last year or so...they are firing people for every small thing. I never get much time with my family either cuz im always working!
bad,"the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the fellow employees the worst part is that no matter how hard you try to advance at target they will not let you move up and give you the same excuses they give everyone and hope you buy it, just so they can push their own agenda."
bad,"if youre in school, it'll probably work for you. my previous stock/inventory control experience did little to give me a leg up. I wasnt even given the job I applied for."
bad,"Long Hours, Poor Pay.  Why do I have to do this.  Worked there in college, terrible back breaking job.  Wouldn't do it again unless I had to.  Some good things, reliable hours and pay."
bad,"I was paid decently, however the pay scale is not fair in terms of position (cashiers and supervisors make almost the same and a cashier could make more depending on how long they worked there). When it came to promotions the decision was based on an affair between two managers rather than the merit of the applicants. I was expected to do the job of my supervisor and my own all the while the were working on basically shutting down the guest service department (where I worked)."
bad,Some of the managers will believe any negative thing about a team member. When you make a mistake and own up to that mistake it’s almost as if they will not give you a chance to prove yourself.
bad,"I worked at Target for about 3 months and let me tell you, the first time I walked through those doors I can feel the hate coming from my trainer. Trust me I’m not even exaggerating. He had to nerve to ask me how did I get this job? He said that because Target has a very tough hiring and interview process and I guess by the way he looked at me, he acted surprised that I even got the job. The people there are fake and they are snakes. They have way too many trainers and they walk around acting like their supervisors when they aren’t. I had multiple trainers telling me to do different things. The group leaders will shake you hand and then turn around and throw you under the bus. Too much favoritism and too many chiefs and not enough indians. The only positive is the pay outside of that, the atmosphere is horrible. If you’re on your 3 month probation, you better cross every T and dot every little I because one minor infraction and they’ll toss you. They are unprofessional, unethical, and very cruel in how they treat their employees."
bad,"There have been multiple occasions when I've had a problem with how or what the management of target(1398) has had me do, or even how they would talk to me was just out of utter disrespect. I know stocking shelves isn't a respectable job but, when you do just even 10% more work than another team member, then I think you deserve alittle more respect. Than the average Joe who just flys under the radar and is never told a word about what they are doing. The management at 1398 is awful. I was lied to about what days I would have off and how many hours I could obtain. I have yet to receive any of what I was told would happen and I've worked for target for 3 years. It's nothing but lazyiness, and out right disrespect."
bad,my biggest issue and main reason for leaving was targets inability to allow me time off to deal with health issues and family emergency. i lost a family member and had to have surgery. both times my job was threatened and so i had enough and left.
bad,"I don't know if every store is the same but in my experience working for Target, every day is gonna be different. Some days the store will be adequately staffed, most days it will not. Some days you may actually have a manager or supervisor who cares and is willing to help you out, some days you'll be lucky if the manager even talks to you. You'll never be allowed to stand up for yourself, whether to an unfair manager or to a lying guest, you're just expected to stand there and take whatever gets hurled at you from either side. On a lighter note, you'll be surrounded by other people going through the same things as you so the culture between regular Team Members is actually pretty awesome and can sometimes make the whole thing worth it. You'll also learn plenty of new skills if you're open to them, from how to talk down unruly people to effective time management and even how and when to designate different tasks to different people."
bad,"If you like a slow paced job where little is expected of you, then Target is the place for you! The LOD's (managers) don't give much feed back on how you are doing."
bad,"Working for the Target Corporation is living proof that we workers live under Inverted Totalitarianism as the great philosopher Sheldon Wolin said. I worked for Target as a seasonal warehouse worker in Galesburg MI, and it was one of the worst jobs I've ever had in my life! I was under constant surveillance like a bug under a microscope. This place has cameras watching cameras, (which are watching other cameras), watching you. The position of being constantly watched is the position of a slave to a master, (and that's what you are to them). The corporation has a group called ""loss prevention"" which is simply a corporate police force that watch workers and decide who will have jobs and who will be fired, (who will be terminated). I'm certain that if they could, they would terminate a workers life. This corporation really is that ugly to their workers. Keep on scrolling down the page, and don't apply. I wish you the best in your job search, but avoid this place like the plague!"
bad,We were misinformed at orientation as they said seasonal workers just need to meet their prods and continue to.improve everyday and be reliable to be hired on full time..the work.wasnt bad or the hours or pay.but management was shady..not a.place I would recommend unless you are willing to break your neck and become nothing but. Anumber..we worked for a month and was given very short notice to be let go.when they made us. believe we had until.March.. They also hire on people who miss days and have. A bad attituude..
bad,"This was my worst job I ever had. I was grateful to have a job. I loved helping the customers and meeting new faces. The job itself was not difficult, however getting hours was."
bad,"Management here doesn't do their jobs. There are about two people who are in management who are decent and seem to somewhat care. As for everyone else, they are rude and don't seem to want to help with anything. They don't listen to the needs of the employees. The other team members are nice with an exception of a few, and the ones that aren't nice have their own little cliques. The amount of work depends on where you are. But if you're super unlucky you'll end up with the bad end of the stick, in a different section every day working like a dog and trying to figure out the mess of a section that belongs to other team members. The pay is fine if you have a set section, but not worth it when you don't because you end up beyond earning your money. Promises of 30 hours a week actually translates to them scheduling you anywhere between 5, 10, and 11 hours a week. I am a very hard worker but your work goes unnoticed here. If they think you are a hard worker, they will milk you dry and never once show any appreciation. I've seen them have people ""training"" for three weeks but only actually train them 3 days and then turn them loose but continue to tell them they are ""training"" so they can justify working them 10 hours a week for three weeks. Overall, it is probably just this location. It definitely needs new management. I'd like to think target as a whole wouldn't stand for some of the behavior from this location that I've witnessed in my time here."
bad,too much work for one person. they arent willing to adjust or change their ways. Not willing to aid or adjust to make job better. dont take employees advice.
bad,Fun workplace but very stressful  not alot of hours and management Sucks. Love their discounts but managers always complains just about everything they don't even give you no recognition for your good work or for treating customers right.
bad,Thomasville  target they just cant get it together worker hate they job stressful would not recommend  any1 workin there MANAGEMENT  iz poor some people know wat they r doing most dont blockheads
bad,The job was ok to start but managment was not good di not let people take ownership of calls or contracts people were not getting correct taining and were or are reprimanded for taking ownership of calls and going that extra bit
bad,I hate this job the managers show favoritism.You get NO hours and they are not fair. Also you are worked like a slave with no concern about your personal needs
bad,"Used to be a great place to work for when I first started; however, with recent changes in management and production, the morale has definitely dropped and so has motivation. There are very few ways to advance which was a lot different than when I first started the job. Team work lacks a lot and due to management and how they expect things, what is supposed to be a team is a very cut-throat think for yourself environment."
bad,"Managers are not very honest they pick on certain people and complain about them not working, while letting other slack off and do whatever they want. Are not very keen on people voicing their opinions about the way things are ran."
bad,Typical work night was around 14-16 hours. Learned that retail is NOT for me! The culture was terrible. hardest part of job was trying to fix a process with being able to make only limited changes.Best part was the pay and benefits.
bad,its okay just don't get enough hours t target. the people I work with are okay its not cultural thing against others. also the pay is okay it could be better
bad,"The people you work with are cool, but what made m leave was management. The store manager and head of HR and HR secretary and awesome and some of the assistant store manages are s well."
bad,"None of the Team Leads, HR or Management ever communicated clearly with each other or us. Impossible to keep up with everyone telling you something different. Ridiculously high turnover ratio. They DO NOT promote from within. Lack of hours make working there impossible."
bad,"I was hired to work in electronics but I ended up spending 90% of my time in sporting goods and toys since nobody worked those areas and they sold more than electronics. They stress all employees being part of a ""team"" but are quick to get mad and fire these close ""team"" members. If you work at Target prepare to organize the shelves all shift and get in trouble for not completing your assigned area."
bad,"It was rather dismal. The managers weren't doing a good job. It felt like they didn't care a whole lot about their employees, like you were expendable."
bad,"I've been working for target over half a year and have found my current Target to be horrid with management. I have a hard time coming to work because I never know if they'll have another reason to yell at me. I've been written up at least 3 times within the last month for calling out because I was sick (I work in the bakery). Other than the management, they're pretty good about making sure you're okay when it comes to HR. They feed you every so often and have special things in the break room from time to time."
bad,"Terrible Management , and i will never work for target again. They always give me a hard time about letting me use the restroom. And iv'e made at least 6 complaints about the management"
bad,Let me start off by saying there is no AC in this warehouse! That alone is enough to keep people away from this place that's ridiculous seeing that we live in Phoenix! Managers have their favorites and give them all the good and easy work while the rest suffer. It's horrible during the summer you're just uncomfortable the entire shift. The pay and benefits are ok but there is no opportunity for advancing in this place. Also you only get 2 breaks in the 10 hour shift a 15 min break and a 25 min break.
bad,"Time off whenever you want it and plenty of hours, but management isn't the best at communication. I worked between 20-40 hours a week part-time. I have been there almost a year now."
bad,"It was overall a weird culture.  I had worked for many Fortune 500 companies by the time I began working at Target, but had never quite experienced a culture like theirs.  It reminded me of the old movie, The Stepford Wives, in that they wanted everyone to act the same and they had an atmosphere of you're either for us or against us...which I didn't understand.  Everyone frequently carried on about what an awesome place it was, but you could tell that it was phony...a lot of phony people and but kissing.  They would call your manager for the least perceived infraction instead of addressing it with you and it could something that was really nothing.  It was very petty, very."
bad,"Target corporation has become out of touch with reality when it comes to running a business. They are under some impression that what works in a podunk town, will work in a major metropolis and vice versa. They run their business model off of a standardized store, so Super Targets are also expected to function on those metrics. The problem is there is a vast difference in operations of the two. What used to be a great place to work, has become a miserable, dreary, and drama filled environment with defeated employees."
bad,"I work in the upstream distribution center in DeKalb, IL. Target as a company is a good company to work for, but working in the distribution center is not so great. The pay and benefits are really good, as well as the ability to work overtime, but the positives stop there. Management is extremely disrespectful to their employees more often than not. Managers are often clueless and should in no way be in charge of 50+ employees as they talk down to their employees, treat them like children, and abuse their authority in running day to day operations like Dictators. Job security is atrocious. This place fires people way too easily, in many cases it being as simple as talking back to other employees or managers, even when those managers or employees are completely wrong about something. Nearly everyday I work in fear that because of any small reason, I could be fired from my job without warning. Also, long hours, mandatory 46 to 64 hour weeks with mandatory overtime, and must work holidays and weekends with every shift. Overall, great pay but garbage place to work."
bad,When i started with the company it was good then the cuts started and the work is now contracted out i went from 35 pulse hours to 16 some weeks since the firs of the year i have not been able to make more then 32 even with picking up shifts the pay is low my last raise was for $0.13 since 2012 i have gotten only $2.00 in raises
bad,They give you too much work for not enough pay and there's absolutely no job security. It kind of felt like I was working with a cult of weirdos. Target is life.
bad,"This is just the opposite of bon-ton, liked management but co-workers were extremely rude and disrespectful.  This job was based on how much was packed out in a day and when you first started you had to be trained by other workers, so if they did not get their quota they would blame it on you for being new."
bad,Working at Target provided me with quite a bit of experience. As a ETL (Executive Team Leader) I was over the Logistics and Property Management departments.
bad,"The pay was alright but once they raised the minimum wage, they started treating the employees very poorly, and enforced unrealistic sales quotas. Definitely would not recommend, unless you prefer working in a stressful environment with management that doesn't care."
bad,"Great staff when I worked in 2004 -2005 . Everyone friendly as regular staff in mostly every department. Management I guess ok. When they promote staff don't know what they look at to promote an employee. Yes people I think I should have got it . I was already doing the job but not title or pay . They sure gave it to a new employee that didn't even know what he was doing . Coming to me for help and asking me questions lol . The best part was when I left and got a nice check getting my last hours with all my sick, vacation time etc . All in one check lol"
bad,"A billion dollar idea that bombed. Lots of promises to employees and customers that never followed through. Awesome security and operation technology, but not enough dedication or man power to pull it off."
bad,I worked here for two weeks and QUIT! I was treated with DISRESPECT; my manager was terrible. Human Resources did nothing about problems I encountered.
bad,I worked for Target for almost three years and received very small to almost non existent raises. They don't care about loyalty and are more concerned with selling and promoting the redcard. They see their team members as easily replaceable. The hours are good if its 4th quarter (christmas time) but after that you're lucky to get more than 20 hours per week. Management could be good or bad depending on who you work with. Some are excellent and care very much about their team and the company and some only care about making sales. My fellow team members for the most part are phenomenal and hard working. I've made many good friends while working here. Working with the guests can be very enjoyable and you meet many great and friendly people. I enjoyed working with a team very much. We all had each others backs. Unfortunately this job was not what it could have been because of the lack of respect and compassion from management.
bad,"I put all my efforts in completing my jobs. I do not have any more to included, this was job to help me in transition to a better job."
bad,"Everyday routine with small group of team members"
bad,all i did was work as sales floor and sold red cards as a cashier. Learned ho.w to sell things better and how to stock merchandise
bad,"This place is by far the worst warehouse I've ever worked at. The pay was good but for the work they expected, it was a rip off . High turn over(over 4%) and if they sense that you are not being a complete sheep you'll get railroaded out of there. I now work at 3M and its day to night in comparison to Target. The management is horrible.. Don't even attempt to voice your opinion.. They hate union for a reason.."
bad,"This place was a great place to work when I first started there. I was there was 2 years and they treated me like I didn't matter or my needs outside of the work place weren't important. My co-workers and talking to the customers are the only thing I enjoyed there. Management was awful, it was so bad when I quit because of the disrespect I was given."
bad,"Don't expect to go far here unless you can sell red cards. That's all they care about and don't see anything else as a positive. Management is constantly changing so don't get used to seeing the same people for more than a few months. Oh, and you'll be working until after midnight and expect to be in for opening 90% of the time."
bad,"I worked for this company for over 10 years. During that time, i had 52 different supervisors of one sort or another. Some didn't even stay long enough to learn my name, but they all were given the authority to comment on work performance. When you think of Target's corporate culture, think Noth Korea. They both have an an ideology that requires you to suspend your belief in common sense, logic and often times your personal ethics in order to fit in to the ""culture"" there. And if you don't or you speak up, you are a marked employee.  Target is a place to stay away from if you have any self respect!"
bad,"The job its self was fine but the ending soured the whole experience for me. After months of asking about closing rumors, we were constantly told not to worry. Two Days after I asked the final time if Target was closing, and was told no, they announced Target Canada was closing all its stores. Least to say, I have very little to say about Target that is friendly so I'll simply stop there."
bad,"Starting out, workplace was great! Great learning experience, opportunities to advance, fun co-workers. Every day we all met for a meeting to keep everyone on the same page.  The hardest part of the job was just keeping up with all the changes, constantly changing daily jobs and constantly changing management. It seemed like we were constantly short staffed too."
bad,"Instead of keeping good employess they constantly want to switch out team members and make them ""brand"".  Hight turnover rate and the store team lead was horrible with building relationships with team members.  Other executive team leads were the same way.  The pay was poor compared to other tech positions.  Target was also more concerned with red card, rewards and other things and they really should have been concerned about patient safety.  More time should be taken on verifying the patients information and counseling and not so much worrying about a red card."
bad,I was accused of falsifying documents because I adjusted too many times axing higher paid employees to bring in lower paid  temporary workers
bad,"it was a great place to work and a lot of great people. when they closed though it was unfair and unprofessional."
bad,"A retail business with a large turn around in new hires. "
bad,"I hated working as a cashier at Target"
bad,Overworked for minimal hours but you learn about hard work and the difference in duties when there is a lack of teamwork.
bad,Unreasonable expectations of performance. Low pay. No work/life balance. Preys on new graduated college students as their management team since they are unaware of what a healthy job environment consists of.
bad,Answer phone and or call employees out. I also translated documents from English to Spanish or Spanish to English.
bad,team associates are great but overall company more concerned about prods than quality and safety.
bad,Everyday was busy helping team members or guests. I learned how to multitask and how to get my work done in a small amount of time.  Co-workers were friendly.
bad,"Assisted Guests with general inquires"
bad,"Basically, your boss will make you his scape goat for his own inability to get results. GE is a horrible position that no one wants and all of your ""peers"" will be quick to judge you and your team but will hide in their offices rather then lend a hand. When you go to your DTL and district peers they will tell you it is your problem and ask what you are going to do to fix the fact that your boss is a lying dude-bro... It's a joke... GE is a complete joke... No amount of money is worth the mental abuse you will go through... don't waste your time.."
bad,I worked over nights there and we would work in our own section and if we did work togather we never really talked so no kind of action to keep us awake and ready to go
bad,"A typical day at work revolves around going to your designated work center and finding out what needs to be done for the day or that week.  Typically in high volume stores such as my store most of this work doesn't get done due to the amount of guests that need to be helped through out the day as well as the frequent calls for back up cashiering due to lack of scheduling enough cashiers.  The people I work and worked with were great overall, but management comes off as sometimes clueless and even ignorant towards team members.  The expectation by them through out the day is all work must be completed regardless of how many people you help and how many times you go to back up cashier.  Failure to complete all of the work typically results in some form of disciplinary action ranging from a simple coaching to a write up depending on how bad management feels it was.  Pay at this company is a joke as its barely above minimum wage.  My particular store its starts at $7.75/hour.  Raises are just as bad as there is only one raise per year and the most anyone is eligible for is $.25 for getting a top rated review.  The problem is if sales the previous fiscal year were bad everyone is automatically docked down one tier lower in their review so that raises will make less of an impact for next year.  Each work center also has a pay rate ceiling and if you reach or exceed that ceiling you no longer qualify for raises without a promotion.  Hours are never guaranteed unless you are part of management, overtime is not approved and if you go into overtime you are written up with no reason other"
bad,"Typical day would be trying to rush through your work load while still trying to do the job correctly. You get baby sat by management while you work, they don't want you talking but yet they expect you to work as a team. As for management, no one seemed to know what they were doing. One person would tell you to do something and another person would tell you to do something completely different. They don't work around your schedule well especially if its for another job or school. They expect you to be flexible with your schedule but they will not be flexible with the scheduling. Working holidays is mandatory. Too much work and not enough pay. Most of the co workers were fine but i can't say the same about management. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it was time to go home."
bad,"I did my part and more for this company, but I felt they did not meet up to there part of the bargain. When I am at work I push myself everyday to achieve better goals. I have my mind set what I am going to do and accomplish. But over all I did not feel they met my needs as in a leadership role."
bad,"Lots of miscommunication among leaders, management style depends on leader moods."
bad,"The supervisors at this store are all incredibly lazy and are rarely held accountable for the problems they cause. There is one supervisor in particular who, from what I've heard, was accused of sleeping with her subordinates. However, this supervisor is next in line to become a store manager, partly because she has fired anyone who mentions this rumor. She also tends to brown-nose the store manager, who is new and has no idea how anything really works."
bad,It's not very good because management is awful and salary is pathetic.
bad,Very hard to describe anything about this job. Not the happiest experience for a job.
bad,"As a place to work in general, it seems okay at the start. However once you get going that changes completely. You get trained in the “official” way of doing your job, but then realize that in order to do the job efficiently you need to break the rules of maximum amount of carts to push in because they won’t schedule more than one person for a three person job.  I have unfortunately been here for over 18 months, have been repeatedly told that out of all the people in my position that I out perform them . However when I ask to move to a different part of the store, I get told that I am exactly what they want for my position. I go back to my manager about 3 months later to ask to move to a different part of the store again because of back injuries and am told that my manager would look at hiring another person for my job and then will move me. It has sense been over 3 months and am still in the same position with no new hires."
bad,"I was hired just as my team lead became a team lead, and someone just became HR. Was thrown into work with next to no training and not much help. My team lead was at times rude and pushed me very hard but didn't explain what to do well nor how to improve without just saying it and expecting me to know exactly what she's talking about."
bad,"It’s a terrible place to work! My “manager” belittled me, yelled at me and made me cry in front of customers! She called me a liar and said that sense I was seasonal I wouldn’t be there longer than the time they needed me for. Even though I had talked to my supervisor and asked him to be put on the schedule as full time"
bad,"Target is all about their money and business. But when it comes to employees, some managers just don't seem to care about their workers. The employees are great and make you feel welcome."
bad,They have a unhealthy work environment. If you want to feel overwhelmed and unsupported then this is the job for you. HR is good to talk to except they tell upper management everything you say so if you have problems with your ETL so just let it go. Don’t get me wrong most of the employees are very nice but the ones who aren’t ruin the entire experience.
bad,they are out of business and no longer in canada so there is not much i can say about them.  they were ok to work for but they are gone now.  if they were still around i would recommend them.
bad,"My Target store is in a weird spot right now. It's offering $13/hour (heading to 15 by 2020), which leads the area I live in right now. However, that pay is almost entirely outweighed by incompetent management and a stressful work environment. Based on the new system in place, too much is expected of individual workers and daily scheduled tasks CANNOT be accomplished, even during the course of an 8-hour workday. Training lacks much efficacy and is, more often than not, done by other employees, rather than a manager. There's a lot more that goes into why this job is not really worth it, but it's late and I don't feel like writing it here."
bad,I don't recommend taking warehouse position. There is clique environment with lot of the workers. When you don't want to be part of this clique; they will find anything on you that they can use to rat you out to management. If you come from good experience; managers seem to feel threaten with your background also they will find something that they can write up on or gets you illegally terminated.
bad,"After your trained, hours are cut significantly. Management tries to frustrate you into quitting. But instead of leaving, I stay and work my 4 hour shift. If they were to hire a steady crew like I had when I first got hired and stop hiring so many people work would get done"
bad,They wanted so much to be done in so little time. They dont schedule well at all. They do not care about what you have going on personally. TheThen they put you
bad,"I loved my work as a Pricing Accuracy Team Member,  I actually miss it. But what I don't miss is the bullying by the other employees, not getting anything other than 5 hrs a week after the holidays. And the yelling from my supervisor expecting all the weeks worth of work done in those 5 hours. I don't even shop at Target, no matter the exclusive products, or deals, they simply are not  worth shopping at."
bad,"The job is challenging and dynamic and a lot of fun. Unfortunately the payroll is so tight that the guests are unhappy with the service we have provided through our best efforts. Without enough help it erases all of your incredibly hard work and guests are dissatisfied anyway. I would honestly give anything to provide all of my guests the absolute best in service, but that would require much more support."
bad,"This place is not a career choice. "
bad,"This is a PC culture stronghold. The squeaky wheel gets the grease atmosphere. They believe the measly tattle tale that first complains. It’s typical modern culture. If you are accused they stage a fake “investigation “. The whole time they assume you are guilty and tries to twist your answers to fit their narrative. If you accept a job at Target, be warned. If even a minor conflict with another person occurs, be the first to report it. Otherwise, you are unfairly shitcanned."
bad,"I’ll start off with stating the positive and the people who were great. Co workers provide great atmosphere they help a lot, managers are awesome, although I think the supervisor would be a choice they have to re consider, all team leads were great! Everyone respects and is kind. Except the only person who seemed to have issues before I got to work there apparently was the supervisor. Working in super target Boynton Beach, is the most stressful job, first they burn you out they only give you days off during the week two days off which is perfect but again specifically during week. You have to work all weekends the girls at the store I would work with some worked for years complained about never having a break, having no social life. It was sad, depressing and frustrating. When they schedule you they put so little people on the floor, and you to one whole department sometimes even 2 pr 3. There is a lot of favoritism. And I saved the worst which to me and I would think to anyone would be a deal breaker the supervisor and the team leader in softlines.  The supervisor is not understanding zero compassion, no effort in showing she cares and appreciates her workers, very cut and dry. Seems like she just cares about the money the job offers."
bad,"Target has quite a few issues in regards to keeping and maintaining quality employees and management. "
bad,"Fantastic pay, once you go in to leadership.  I'm sure my store was an isolated instance, but team member availability was often ignored by my ETL, causing scheduling issues every single day.  Overall culture was stressful and caused many team members to leave the store, resulting in a 100% turnover rate for the store.  This included several tenured leaders leaving for competitors or other industries altogether.  Employees weren't held to the same standards.  Some got fired for the same thing that others got away with."
bad,The environment was very toxic and full of favoritism. I got looked at negativity specifically by this one person which made me uncomfortable. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work there unless you want to fake it and be stressed out.
bad,Target is a very stressful job no one would send someone to help you with what you need to do and management is poor at what they do with their customers and employees
bad,"My day started at 6am about four days a week. Learned how to make labels, markdown merchandise and help with the remodeling of the store. Working in receiving boxes were very heavy this was hard to do. We had lots of baby showers and birthday celebrations."
bad,"They basicly try to fit 5lbs of trash in a 3lbs bag. Working back room during the unload is a complete mess. Theres stuff everywhere but they want everything to be nice and neat. If your going to the sales floor it might be ok i guess but not really. Management wants everything done perfectly and it was suppose to be done yesterday. Employees can be the best part of going to work and the customers oh I mean ""the guest"". Like I said it's not for me but I see some people that's been there forever and have know intent to leave."
bad,"Can be a fun place to work, but they have a high turnover rate for higher ups, and sometimes you get good leaders often you dont. The managers  are very lazy ."
bad,"Personally, there is too much turnover at Target. I worked as a seasonal cashier and there was so much turnover just during the holiday months. The pressure to get customers to open Red Cards also made the job not enjoyable."
bad,"Minors being forced to work 9-12 hour shifts with 1 10 minute break (IL state labor law dictates 1 30 minute unpaid and 1 15 minute paid break every 5 hours, another 15 minute break at 8, etc for minors) Adults forced to stay past 2 am, scheduling them only 3 hours therefore entitled to no break during an 8 hour shift (cashiers cleaning the sales floor after close because once a month 3 sales floor people might have to work a register for 5 minutes) I personally was injured on the job, had their doctors diagnose me and give my limitations that were ignored, constantly scheduled outside of availability. I quit because they were refusing to give me the FIRST anniversary of my daughters death off because it suddenly became a black out date nearly 8 months after requesting it off, and then management refusing to let others trade shifts so that I could mourn the death of my two year old."
bad,"Pay was great and that was about it."
bad,"I was really expecting more from Target! I was offered a position and then left hanging for 5 weeks with no communication as to when I would actually start. Management is extremely unorganized, I don't think they even communicate between themselves! Was told one thing and then expected to do another on a fairly consistent basis. I never felt my job was secure as employees are replaceable. Their discount is a joke, you can't use unless your paying with cash (I never carry cash) or their redcard. I will NEVER go back to Target and I've considered shopping elsewhere as well!!"
bad,They hire people who spend most of the time on their phone. Young and dumb. Very disrespectful to employees and tell you what to do. The team leads are too busy drinking and eating at Starbucks. They don’t back up employees
bad,"It was a fun, but busy environment, where I assisted customers with making coffee and with selections, while always delivering the highest standard of customer service."
bad,Horrible communication between management and team.  expectation out of reach for a day.  Target corporation came in 6momths ago and changed everything.  my job did a 360 and i tried to adjust but just couldn’t and most could not.
bad,"Started out fine but once I was cross trained in everything except food and basically slave driven for peanuts I decided enough was enough. Coworkers are wonderful, management is ok but I strongly suggest looking elsewhere for a career this job is soul sucking and very demanding on mental and physical health."
bad,"Don't work at Target. On my first day of training, no one was there to train me. The next day my trainer did nothing other than just stand there and watch me. Then when I asked her to train me, she rudely told me, ""I won't baby you.""  I was never taught how to remove the security belts. I was never told how to request change or how to accept rebate checks or anything in general. I taught myself every single thing, during back to school season. When I told my manager about this, he apologized to me for having that experience, but never made any move to fire her or hold her accountable. That is a big problem with Target. They hold their employees accountable for a money mistake but not for anything else that effects other employees on the job, which creates a more toxic environment."
bad,Management treated the company like a popularity contest & if she didn't like you ten she didn't give you the hours. I was scheduled for 8 hours in one week when they were in need of the help & i said i was available. Poor Management
bad,"I loved working for Target for about 8 months until management got worse and was poorly run. People who have work there for years got the same pay as someone who just started. I knew a co worker who was there for 4 years and wanted to go up in the business but was told she wasnt able to, but a few months later, hired a new team leader who has never worked for Target.  Leaders pushed other leaders out of their job so they can bring in the ones they want. I never felt appreciated for the work I did and I tried so hard and yet the lazy ones were still favorited. Never made sense to me. Management is horrible."
bad,"Everyone that I work with at target are really good people, but I feel like they are poorly treated and favorites are picked amongst us. no one gets enough hours, we are all full time and they tell us they don't have hours to give yet they hire more people. asking for full time at the interview in their eyes is giving you 20 hours if your lucky. They are not understandable if your sick for longer than a day and if the roads are icy and it's storming out, they will still expect you to drive and come in and if you don't they count it as an absents against you. Half the old ladies that work their tell me that they have to dip into their social security to help pay their rent because they aren't given enough hours and I think that's pretty bad because they have worked there over 20 years and target just gives their hours to the younger men who start working there. I just think target is inconsiderate in general towards people. if you are close with the managers there then they will talk with you about any subject you like and not care if you stop working while doing it but if they aren't friends with you and they see you talking with other people then they will get onto you and put you to work in another area away from that person."
bad,i have learned a lot there over the years i have been employee. I have also cross trained in other areas. You do your work you look for the boss and ask if they have anything else for you to do  before you leave. But mostly they want you to work with less hours for a shift that requires more of time.
bad,The pay is the only reason i stay. Moral is terrible. No consequenses when simeone does bad. No reward when someone does good. There are lazy complacent people there that get away with murder.
bad,"I was hired on as back to school seasonal as softlines. It was extremely high paced to keep up with the store because of the season however around September it slowed down a lot. I was asked to stay and who wouldn't turn down a job at target? The pay was AWESOME for being in college. However, management is TERRIBLE. Lack of communication, don't care for the part-time employees (out of the 7 I had, including HR, I only liked one) and disrespectful. I had my Grandma in the hospital and the death of a close friend by a accidental shooting. Lack of communication caused me to have a ""no call no show"" from the managers and I was guilt tripped by my manager for wanting to be out of state to spend time with my sick Grandma instead of slaving 35 hours a week in college while taking 18 credits. I constantly stayed late, covered shifts and worked overnights when I had 8AM classes the next day.I have also heard a LOD talk poorly about my department in the aisle with another worker. The word got around and she was disliked by many, completely unaware of what the exact issue was. Until she started kissing everyone's butt for people to like her again.  Despite these issues, I stayed with the company because of the pay, discounts and my classmates worked there. I needed to transfer because of switching schools. long story short, I was ""accepted"" of the transfer. However, once I arrived at the new store, they said they contacted my HR saying I couldn't be hired on because they were letting go of seasonal at the moment. my HR knew of this days before I had my last shift of my last 2 weeks. (I"
bad,"Coworkers are very stuck up and think its okay to talk down about you unless you have the same lifestyle/ opinions. "
bad,I am trans and they promised to protect me and my real name and put the name that I go by. Three times they posted my real name for everyone to see putting me in danger.
bad,"worked their a long time agao ,was sent home when no work was available even if we had just came to work,inconsistent hours and no advancement potential"
bad,"I started working at Target as a Logistics Specialist . First of all I had to call to call them to ask if I can be put on the schedule I didn’t start my first day until 3.5 weeks after orientation. My first day at Target was On Thanksgiving which was Disturbing Because of all the Orders That were in que & I Had not been trained. The Manager was VERY VERY RUDE! I didn’t know what to do and that seemed to have ticked him off, I was not informed that I could not Leave the building for my breaks So I was stuck in the Building with no food for what would have been 8 hours with no food (if I wouldn’t have Quit). & When I did advise the Manager I was Leaving He was Very Rude and All he Said was “Give me Your Work ID.” Overall I love Target to shop but they can KISS MY FOOT before they think I’ll EVER try to come back to work."
bad,"They encourage management to be rude to employees, stingy with hours, give you raises but then cut your hours in half. Im not sure if every store is like this but I've heard it is. Work somewhere else."
bad,"How you do your job means very little in getting advancements. Say what they want to hear, is the butt of the person telling you what to say and make sure you fit the mold of someone who will get them a raise.... you'll be fine."
bad,"Target assigns hours to Market based on freight volume only. They do not take into account pulling items in daily batches, backstock time, cleanup time, time to push/cull fresh produce, zone the area, or clean the area."
bad,"There wasn't a single day going to work there did I enjoy it. I went in knowing something bad happens everyday. No heat or air conditioning made things worse. Breaks were ridiculously short. Within 10 hours, even though paid, you got one 12 minute and one 22 minute break only. Anymore and you'd get penalized. Every day was a race to break at the sound of the break bell because everyone was required to break at the same time. Having only 6 microwaves for 40 people didn't prove to do well. Management would hire more people but get rid of necessary equipment to run the job efficiently then later penalize anyone who falls behind because they lacked the equipment that was rid of. The only enjoyable part of the job was the weekly paycheck. Nothing else. The job did teach me teamwork and values. Other than that it was nothing but a cruel environment."
bad,"Executives at target came out of college with no skills to deal with people. This is why they would hand off responsibility to their subordinates. People who had no idea about how the real world works. How to treat their subordinates, when they had personal problems, or they didn't feel good. they would just say ""suck it up"" or ""I can't deal with that"" or ""do your job, or else"". Then the STL (Store Team Leader) would have nothing to say. Not a very positive work environment."
bad,I don't have much to say about Target. It just wasn't for me and I wish the rest of the employees the best of luck. The people there were like a little family and so nice. If you want to excel there you need to have a degree. If you are a lead you have to work you team members hard or you will be taken advantage of.
bad,"I am on the Hardlines floor which consist of everything from cleaning supplies all the way to bathroom and bedroom needs. The job itself is pretty easy. You scan outs and stock shelves, while helping guest along the way. If you work nights you have to zone. Most of the time you zone two areas of the store. But, alot of the times they do not have enough workers and they give you three areas. The management are bullies. They like to push you until you are at your breaking point. They chose two to four people to bother each week. They don't care if you have to much to do in one night, they will talk down to you and make you feel worthless. If your management's favorite you get away with everything.  The other workers that are there are friendly and out going. If they don't like you they either don't talk to you or only talk to you about work."
bad,"Cashiering, greeting customers and completing sales."
bad,Never again it was honestly the worst job experience of my life I would never wanna do it again and wouldn't recommend it to any one stay clear cause they will do you wrong
bad,"I had a lot of problems at my target but it might have just been the location of my specific store. Poor & unprofessional management. Unqualified Team Leaders. Hostile environment. They barely give you hours, messy & unorganized."
bad,"If things went wrong, which they normally did, the surrounding floor managers were slow to react, if they did at all. They were quick to dump blame on the workers and not help to find a solution."
bad,Long days with very hard labor work in back room stocking. Not very nice management. Employees are nice but management was not pleasant. Didn't at target very long
bad,No accountability for anyone.  Lack of concern by mgmt.  They are raising the pay for right-off-the-street hires to just less than what the people make who've been there for 10+ years.  Unfair.
bad,Lack of communication can never get a hold of hr or a lod or etl worse place to work plus its 4 hour shift only 2-3 nights a week. Theres a lot of favoritism going around and back stabbing and stealing
bad,Target is a great company to work for but management needs work. There's no point in pre-planing because you are told what to do everyday. There is a lack of communication with managers and their team leads.
bad,Target is overall a great community but the location I worked for was a little unstaffed unorganized and had a bad reputation with customers. The manager had a habit of taking stress out on employees
bad,"typical day is stressful, huge workloads, and understaffed. I learned to rely on myself and work independently. Management is not that bad. the workplace is decent."
bad,"Very labor intensive, poor working conditions, defective machinery, very high stress, most enjoyable aspect of the job is the weekend and vacation days."
bad,i feel like management should always back up there workers in which they do not they go by the saying the customers always right in which they are not and thats one thing that i had to always deal with while working in there the managers never really listened to there employees and showed alot of specialties when it came to certain positions were avaliable to apply for they would not tell any one about them and that was not right
bad,"I got hired as a seasonal warehouse associate, first week we got certified on the cherry picker and learned what job functions we would be doing. Management was so rude and had no idea what was going on. The veteran workers ran the warehouse. Whenever you ask a question management would point you to a warehouse associate who most of the time was rude as well. Schedule was four tens Tuesday-Friday 4pm-3:30 am."
bad,I loved my coworkers but management was like a dictatorship. It was hard to be happy when management would yell at you for things out of your control.
bad,"Working at Target has been a unique experience. At first, I tried to organize the store, but soon learned that no one wanted to be organized or even cared about being organized. Executives are unwilling to accept feedback and cannot even get along with each other. Executive leaders are very pushy and not willing to help out when the need arises. Overall, not very impressed with the company."
bad,"Target is an ""at will"" employer and they will fire you for anything, I mean anything.If anyone goes to hr and makes a complaint, target will terminate you. They pay good, but job security is no good. You never know when is your last day. Management likes to micromange all their employees. There is a lot of favoritism at target too. I am talking about target ware houe d.C locations in rialto. The culture isnt good neither. Everyone stabs eachother in the back. No one is trusted and target doesnt care about their employees , their medical insurance sucks."
bad,"The worst part of the job was the work/life balance along with the poor treatment of the individuals that worked in the stores from Senior Management.  I enjoyed the people that worked inside the stores, however the Senior Management brought down the culture."
bad,"Target wasn't as bad as many of my other jobs, but as a first job is wasn't that bad. I was just an overnight stocker and truck unloader. Honestly there wasn't much I learned there, but I didn't stay for long. The management where I was at didn't support military personnel which I was, I had gotten ""let go"" because I refused to work on a drill weekend. My co-workers were nice and very helpful, however there was a lot of drama. but like I said it was my first job. It wasn't hard or easy, you just had to learn how to deal with difficult management."
bad,"Hated working here because some people that are consider higher"
bad,"If you can handle the sudden shifts in activity, namely back to school through Christmas, and Valentines through Easter, you will be fine working for this company."
bad,Working for the distribution center was a bad experience management is bad and you are grated like a number and you are accused of things and wrote up so group leaders don't have to take the fall this is a bad place to work bringing in temp workers and firing regular employees that have been there for years
bad,if u like up selling every person n shoving the red card down ppls though.
bad,"I have many years in retail in all types of capacities. This company had the worst training program I have ever seen or experienced. I started during the week of black Friday and the company cut my training short simply to use me as a body on the sales floor. Once the smoke cleared they refused to allow me the time to continue my training. The management was more concerned about the daily workload than me understanding what I was actually doing. I was forced to resign, when I was told by a executive that on my 90 day mark, I was going to be terminated. Out of fear of having that on my record, I resigned on the 89th day. This company was my worst retail management experience I ever had. This company culture is a sham. I would never recommend this company to anyone at any level."
bad,"A typical day is fast paced.  I learned that Target is an extremely political place to work, always have a backup plan, management is constantly looking for ways to terminate.  The co-workers are generally the best part of the job, real team players, really talented, hard working people.  if you are unhappy or are being targeted, transfer to another Target or get out.  the hardest part is getting along with management and getting write-ups that are inconsistent, in essence each employee has a separate set of rule to adhere to based on managements FEELINGS.  Target should have a union for the unjust treatment the employees endure. the most enjoyable part of the job would be getting results with your peers as a Team and pleasing the guests/customers."
bad,"lives by the phrase ""getting more with less""; company struggling; managers incompetent, turnover increasing and talent getting less qualified"
bad,"Cuts corners, bad management, poor pay, no benefits, terrible hours."
bad,"Long, boring but stressful days."
bad,When I first started I was on the cash register helping a customer and I didn't know how to log in or anything.so a team member came over and started to train me.
bad,"A typical day at work includes cleaning, stocking, assisting guests find what they need, and being back up for all other departments. I learned that this job is not a place for advancement, and it is really a starter job. Management is awful and they are not there to help you advance, they are there to benefit themselves. Your co-workers are lazy and don't really like to help. The hardest part of the job is the pay and getting hours. The most enjoyable part is the 10% discount."
bad,"When I first started, I actually enjoyed working here. Throughout the years it's just gotten worse. Some etls are too buddy buddy with some team members (I.e. playing favorites, discussing they're personal lives). Other etls are just plain lazy. Basically if you're not buddy buddy or kissing some serious butt, you're not really going anywhere. "
bad,"A typical day at Target would consist of starting my daily duties, stocking, giving customer service etc. Ive learned to interact very well with customers needs. The managment team has poor communication, this also effects the hardest part of the job though it is very important. Most enjoyable part will be working with my co workers getting along with people and making customers happy."
bad,"Didnt learn much, they had me working with cleaning materials at 8 months pregnant."
bad,Arriving at work was always a posotive experience until management would fill our heads with negative input concerning our workload
bad,I stocked foods on a typical day of work and would learn how to handle different situations dealing with customers. management helped motivate an keep team spirit positive. Co-workers where fun and energetic.There where no hard parts of the job but dealing with customers was sometimes challenging. Working with a team was the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,"A typical day for a warehouse associate is going to start up where you listen to GLs (bosses) talk and discuss the plan for the day, you do a slight streching warm up. Then you are given a function for the day. Often the temperature in the warehouse ranges from extreme heat in the summertime to extreme cold in the wintertime. The productivity goals they set for the workers are impossibly high and unrealistic due to poor planning and consistantly being shortstaffed on functions. Their ORI rate is high due to lack of training for new hires and instead of solving the root of the problem that caused the accident they often look for any way or reason to blame the victim. You don't have one boss you have upwards of four bosses all lacking in communication skills and often each one assigns you a different task without referring to the other bosses. When talking to you about development opportunities and giving feedback it is always in a disrespectful condesending tone. They force 80 workers (on a busy day) to eat in one small break room and fight over 16 microwaves, while they give the GLs and SGLs a pizza party. They would rather hire from outside the warehouse instead of hiring from within. The only enjoyable part of the day is the other warehouse associates. They are some of the hardest working, most under appreciated people I know. They are the backbone of the company but it seems like Target would rather reward the poor performers and punish the hard workers. The hardest part of working at Target is the leadership themselves. They are lazy, disrespectful, and find anyway to push"
bad,Target was a great experience. The logistics team was awesome and I had fun learning and working for them.
bad,"I was hired as a full time employee right before the holiday season at which time I left another job for what I thought would be a great opportunity at Target. Management used us throughout the season working us beyond imaginable, while making sure we didn't hit the 40 hr. mark. Now that the holidays are over management and HR has dropped our hours drastically, and no one in management seems to care that we aren't able to pay our Bill's with 15 hrs or less a week."
bad,I did a very good job as a cashier.  Even the customers complimented me.  I fell that they are discriminated to seniors.  I never called out or limited my availability.  Every time there was a sign up for help I applied until they blocked me from trying.
bad,"The co-workers are fun but management are incompetent, angry, and treat people like robots. Told by HR “even if management is in your face you just take it.”"
bad,"I enjoyed meeting new people every day. The most enjoyable part about my job was my regular customers going through my line, it always made my day. I always had fun stories and memories to look back at."
bad,Honestly I was constantly being belittled and management who had been there a long time refused to go with Target on the modernization techniques that they were doing and when I was hired on I was trained to run a Target the new way and they didn't like me and would intentionally   do things to get rise out of me. Many other leaders and team members saw first had what was going on and left.
bad,"I didn’t get trained at all, was kind of just thrown into the position with little knowledge and get yelled at by higher up when I messed up even though I wasn’t thoroughly trained. One of the leaders speaks to me in a very condescending way, as if i’m an idiot most of the time. The management just seems childish and immature. I wouldn’t recommend working here."
bad,Way to much pressure on the team leads and employees. The backroom is a nightmare. You feel like you're drowning in freight. Good workers will get burnt out in no time here.
bad,Don't get old.never do anything wrong it's unacceptable to them. Watch for brown nosers they will stab you in the back. Don't get hurt they don't want you anymore if you get injured.
bad,"If I’m being honest, my overall experience at Target was very weird. I applied for a part time permanent position at Target, I was promised 30 hours a week (I made them aware I was leaving a full time job that was paying me less), and was promised my position was permanent. As my start date gets closer, I’m told my position is a completely different position than what I was offered, I am getting paid more than my old yes, but my hours were only 8 hours a week. Which means, I went to work twice a week. Mind you, Target knew I had open availability, as i asked for more hours they offered me hours for the position I was originally supposed to get, but told me i had to wait till someone called off in order to receive those hours. Now... what’s even weirder, is as I’m clocking in, I realize in their system i’m under “seasonal”, then I ask why i’m under seasonal if I was told i’m permanent? they replied everyone who starts in september is put under “seasonal”. my interviews were in early august. i was offered the job in august. they didn’t start me till september... seems shady. very shady. would not recommend working here, i wouldn’t expect this experience from Target, and this is honestly a warning for the people who are offered a job that pays a dollar or two more than what you’d get at your full time job. make sure you bring up your hours you’re promised, and that you’re an actual permanent associate."
bad,"Bad management who only cared about themselves Immature co workers. Work overload of 1 person in such a short shift. among other things, worst place ive ever worked."
bad,"Target is a great place to work. The store is fun and are very flexible but they don’t t give enough hours, they keep you part time in purpose .. they hire multiple bodies and allocated hours are not all given. They bank hours"
bad,"People were constantly leaving and quitting because of how horrible the management is. The management has favorites and if you're not one of them, then you'll be treated like a rock under their shoe. They didn't honor my requests when i asked for more hours. They always gave me a ""I'll talk to so and so about it"", but never did. So i would be getting less than $300 every TWO weeks. Then they fire me for no reason, because I'm not one of their favorites."
bad,"As a long time employee at this specific Target store, I would not recommend it to even my worst enemy. The pay is good, starting at $13 an hour, but I promise it is not worth it. Management will berate you any chance they get and they rarely give positive feedback. It seems as if they punish the good workers and leaders by giving them impossible tasks and then going and hanging out at their desks. Management will also openly talk badly about each other and employees"
bad,My overall review with Target was an okay experience. The reasoning why I say this is because they need to be better at visiting the store for more than an hour or two to judge the staff and employees and how the store is going. They also need to do better with just understand how we feel about the new changes and the environment. This doesn’t apply to all Targets it’s just the certain ones I worked at.
bad,"Very poor communication, favoritism within higher management. Very low hours and no care for your personal schedule. 100% would not recommend if you have bills to pay. HR and store manager thinks they're high and mighty, fake, nice to your face but talk behind your back. They try and compensate with having food in the break room as if that's going to pay your bills. There's no room for growth. The only Pro for me are my coworkers. I can't wait to get out of there."
bad,DO NOT WORK HERE! They pay well but it is not worth it. They will give you 40 hours one week and 20 the next! The management is terrible and you don't get 15 minute breaks. You get your lunch break but that have to give that to you. What really sucks is that I been there for years and everything was fine. All of a sudden almost every manager got transferred and the managers that were left don't have a clue of what they are doing.
bad,"Maybe it was my fault, but it was my first retail job after I got out of the military. That job should be re titled to ""janitor and cart slave, sometimes cashier"" Once everyone realized I was the new guy, I was the only one cleaning bathrooms, getting carts from outside, and then they had the audacity to call me when I was off to ask me to do cashier. This might be just a problem at this store in Rancho Cordova, but there was a bad clique problem with management. I tried to tell them what was happening but they didn't do anything. This lead me to quitting on the spot one day, for being treated like a slave."
bad,"Start your day by showing up on time, but have to wait outside for at least 10 minutes for a key carrier to open the front door for the team members. Learned how to manage through an ever changing atmosphere and management strategies. Excelled in delivering an amazing store experience through a well planned and organized corrective maintenance process."
bad,its would be nice if they smile with ot without workers and know what to do in there training show the whole store and work station plus who will train them the next step
bad,May not be all Target stores and could have just been a one of at the store I worked at. The manager was more than willing to throw his employees under the bus and cut their hours while giving them an extreme amount to do (Knowing it cant be done) only to turn around and give them write up after write up until they either leave or have enough to be let go. The turn over rate was extreme once he became the manager people left in droves and even new employees would cave in within a day or so. Became a state of constant hiring to cover all the positions being lost. I actually enjoyed Target before he got there. Also any work I did the caused success wasn't anyone's doing but his and don't dare to try to correct him on it.
bad,"The job at target had unreachable requirements, and stressful consequences. Leadership was pushy and rude. Was expected to know information from meeting I was not expected to attend."
bad,I would say they pay good for the work that you have to do.Go in there with a clear head and don't befriend anyone stay to yourself.People only worry about themselves.
bad,"Corporate came in and Made the place a mess."
bad,"Working at Target(3) was a great experience if this is your first job ""better then Amazon(1) or Walmart(2)"". If you work hard enough, you'll feel accomplished depending on your role at the store. It's very unlikely that you'll get promoted, unless you like to gossip. It always seemed to me like we were back in highschool. I understand that this is suppose to be a highschool/college job, but why treat all your employees like this job is just a revolving door...no loyalty. I had worked for this company for 7+ years, the best part of working at Target was the co-workers. You'll create a family, home away from home. Poor mangement, the stores I have worked for always seem like their were to many managers and they could never get on the same page. They would always talk behind your back and be very bi-polar it seemed. If you choose this job. I would recommend either Backroom or Plano, you'll feel more part of the store then just a face customers ""Guests"" can yell at. No yearly raises thanks to being a minimum wage job. You'll make the same as the guy that's been there for 3+ years. Even though when I got hired on, I was told that I would get a pay increase for the line of work I did. Guess I had to find out the hard way. Overall I really loved the job and I always felt like I had good integrity and took pride in that company for helping my store's get a 10% comp(comparable same-store sales) from the following year in the grocery department/sales floor. I guess that isn't how you get promoted in retail, it really is a shame. That shouldn't be how companies are ran. Promote from the"
bad,Worked here when it first opened then it closed. It was runned differently then what I was used to. But overall a good experience. I would definitely work here again if Target didn’t shutdown in Canada.
bad,The management is terrible and the employees are very child like and mean. It's not a team effort its everyone for themselves. The store manger is not very professional at all.
bad,"I really enjoyed my job at Target, but did not enjoy the leadership. From the district leaders to store leaders they were very selective who they liked. Raises were given based on how much they liked you, not on your performance, management lack empathy for employees and customers, extremely negative environment. Executive managers would keep team leaders whom they were well aware were not treating employees right because they would hang out with them outside of work. Felt like I was in middle school again except these were grown adults with children of their own."
bad,"typical day is truly awful. the work isn't hard, but the emptiness you feel due to the lack of care from management is awful. youre not a person to them. youre just a body to work"
bad,Constantly being harassed for productivity and safety when management does nothing to clear the obstacles that create the issues. Management is very poor and is creating a  bad moral in the warehouse.
bad,Nothing good to say about the place. worked there for 8 years. the first 2 years were great the the original GL's started transferring to other DCs and we started getting GLs with 4yr degrees in anything and they knew nothing about supervision or running a warehouse and in my opinion the place went down hill from there.  They want you to run production numbers but don't pay production pay.
bad,"Went out of business. First owner by Radio Shack t\hen bought out by Target. Under Radio Shack there was no organization, poor compensation and benefits, employee turnover was extremely high. I hope Target has better luck with the department."
bad,"Management was flexible with scheduling..especially for students still on school.not much room for advancement within the company , pretty much just a filler job until you find something better or for retail experience"
bad,"Honestly, it all depends on what store you work at. I worked for target for 5 years and I only stayed because I couldn't find anything better. My coworkers are the only thing that kept me sane. Management was horrible, especially the store manager. If you want to work for Target, avoid Waterford Lakes."
bad,"The work itself was easy and fast, with that being said, the management and higher ups of the grand rapids mn store most of the time dont even know what is happening in their store or how to run their store. There are many unhappy employees whos concerns and ideas are not heard or listened to. The wages are low with little to no room for advancement in any department. Management is more than willing to throw other employees under the bus to save their own reputations. As for job security if you are happy with low wages, low hours, and poor management youll be just fine."
bad,9 years.... so a lot more good than bad. Current times are tough however. Operates like you would expect from a big company. Lacks a guiding strategy currently which is directly impacting job satisfaction and security.
bad,"As an early morning Logistics team member I arrive at work at "
bad,Target is a okay place to work. If you are looking for advancement in a company this is not for you. It is time for a change for me. I am ready for something more challenging. My co-workers are good people to work with. I have some supervisors who need a little more training with how to talk and treat their employees. The job that I have at Target is not hard at all.
bad,"The pay is awesome but is not worth it. They work you to your bones and still expect more. You are scheduled for a minimum of 50 hours a week but expected to work at least 60. If you are not working the extra hours, they tell you that you are not helping your store and will be written up. I would never, ever, under any circumstance go back to Target as an ETL."
bad,The position required members to work as a team.  When management decides to cut hour people have a tendency to leave.  When there is low amount of hours and the team has been thirsty for manpower.  The task presented to us doesn't get accomplished.
bad,"In the beginning, I loved working at Target. The management seemed great, the hours were good to help open the store. However, that quickly changed once the store opened. I went through 3 different team leaders, nobody cares about my department, they never let me work in my department, and then they get mad when stuff doesn't get done in my department. I have been threatened at work by an executive team leader. I have been told my work is not good enough. I have been falsely accused of purposely missing a ""start meal"" punch on the punch clock. The list just goes on and on. The management does not care about you and clearly have favourites. They act like they are still in high school and act like they are superior. Newsflash! You're not superior, you're 30 year old working a retail job for the rest of your life. I once went for 2 weeks with one 4 hour shift. They are too cheap to turn the air conditioning on and I sweat to death every shift. In the winter they won't turn the heat on and I freeze to death. I can't wait to find a new job."
bad,"Worst job I've ever had. Management was all over the place, and they hired any and everyone. horrible pay"
bad,"Target Danforth would be a pretty okay place to work if it wasn't for the inconsistent hours, rules and communication. procedures will change from day to day, and almost never communicated to the whole team. most of my coworkers were incredibly kind, and fun to work with. i would have probably began looking other employment much sooner if it wasn't for the great coworkers. the management has no sense of how long certain task take to complete. they also demand compliance to often conflicting corporate marching orders such as telling employees that we are empowered to give customers a certain discount (up to 20%),  but then demanding that we must go to a superior when ever someone asks for something off an item due to damage or cheap prices at a different store. i found the hard part of the job was finding a reason to show up when the management doesn't respect submitted availability. the most enjoyable part is talking with my fellow co-workers. the are some funny people. the ping pong table is pretty nice too"
bad,"at first the hours were good the people were nice management was great but as soon as the store opened (which was a epic fail due to the lack of promotion) everything went completely south. Hours were cut immediately for those that were not the favourites, the fake friendly and helpful management was gone. At times I could not locate any supervisor. Plus nobody would answer their walkies. Only positive is the regular team members"
bad,You give your all and the pay is horrible. You would have to work  24/7 to live off the pay.
bad,"My day began with banking the registers to begin the day, I had many opportunity's to interact with customers whether it would be a dispute or a compliment I had several cashiers with different backgrounds which were always interesting to discover, There was no hard part to this position, Most enjoyable part were the team member's"
bad,"Every day is definitely different, which is both fun and challenging. I learned a ton about hiring, firing, human resources, store set up and maintenance, asset protection, and running a business. Upper management is demanding. Some are fair some are not. Hardest pert of the job is long hours, holidays, and weekends. I enjoyed the people i supervised that had much more experience than me, but were so supportive. "
bad,The Place Was Horrible Too Much Work For Little Pay! Horrible management you couldnt always get wat u requested off and other problems at work was just not good.
bad,a typical day at target a smile on your face no matter what and always find sometrhing to do do matter if its slow are not.
bad,Co-workers are nice.Place went downhill under new management. They expect miracles with so much to do and so little time. Also they don’t respect your availabiliy and will change it to their liking.
bad,"I highly don’t recommend to work at Target, horrible management, they don’t treat you fairly as an employee, and most of all, really unenthusiastic people to work with (depends what department you work in of course). I was a third party contractor but the management in Target overall was awfully performed, didn’t like most of the managers and didn’t along with most of them. Personally, I’m a outgoing and friendly person so I do my best to get to know one another otherwise I’m a timid and won’t speak at all. I just hope target gets new management pretty soon"
bad,"- asked to complete tasks with inadequate resources"
bad,The job was good at first but the longer I was there the more tiring it got to do the job. I had the night shift and had to package and send out 55 boxes in one hour.
bad,No loyalty to long stand employees  They do not provide Adequate hours To sustain a productive life style. The had since of Directions for the team and no clear-cut motivation. Had a hard time getting more hours
bad,Never had a bad job before in my 15+ years working but target has to be the exception. Literally the worst place to work at wouldn’t recommend it 👎🏻
bad,$13 an hour sounds very encouraging and worth the money until you come to the realization that you’re only working 4 to 5 hour shifts and given less than 15 hours a week. Doesn’t help that they pay bi weekly. I found that out the hard way when I thought I was getting paid on one Friday and didn’t find out that I wasn’t getting paid until the following week. I’m sorry but how is a person supposed to survive on that rate of pay?
bad,"Target may look nice from the outside, but behind the scenes (at least at the location I worked at for over 3 years) it is in complete shambles. We never had enough hours to schedule the number of people require to finish our tasks in a timely fashion, never had enough people to fairly distribute the work load, and very often had to fill positions and perform tasks outside of the purview of our job titles and duties. They cut corners wherever legally possible (and sometimes illegally if they think they can do it without being caught), they overwork the people that actually do their jobs well while blissfully allowing lazy workers to stand around and do nothing as long as the good workers are picking up the slack."
bad,The Target that I worked for was terribly miss managed and didn’t care about the workers at all the higher ups are ridiculous and Act like they own the whole company
bad,"The attitudes received on a daily basis from Store director & team leads is really bad, no one should be mean to others or treat them as poorly just because we work under you....."
bad,What’s bad at working at Target is the management. To many non qualified folks in management position lost and dumb founded. The ETL of styles the new lady is a hit mess she has ran all the good workers away. She will lie on you and write you so watch out for here and push record on your phone when holding a conversation with her lol she forgetful she will swear she didn’t tell you that. The first day she started she had her feet propped up on the HR desk chilling with the HR manager so that says a lot about those two so watch out. It’s a joke cus it’s several people in management meets the old saying dumber than a box of Rocks! The pay is good but the foolishness is real as that junky store but when I had enough I walked out!
bad,"Experience at target with a different culture was horrible, verbal abuse, constant harassment and bullying.  Manager of the same culture protected each other.  Manager would not change my shift so that I did not interact with the bullies or transfer me when asked.  It was depressing and disheartening this was the only job available."
bad,"Although the work environment is amazing, there is very little room for growth. If you are not a favorite, then you can forget about moving higher in the company. The management sees team members as expensable and don't treat you fairly."
bad,Poor management skills. They  will hire anyone for management if you have a degree. In anything. Seriously anything.  They all tell you to do something all at the same time. They all want it done all at once too.
bad,I enjoyed working there I enjoy working with the co-workers I had there management kept you short staffed but your job was adequate enough to get done
bad,"You get paid good money and raises are easy to come by but management is a huge disappointment they have their own posse and if you arent a certain way you are outcasted. They like to mass hire and mass fire and claim they are flexible but if you have school and work they cut your hours down to 1 shift per week after ""working"" with you for 2."
bad,"They expect grown people to live off of only a few hours a week. Rude management. Does not transfer call off messages to the head manager and rules it as a “no call no show” even though you called. Doesn’t care about employees at all, just the company."
bad,I'd clock in for work and start moving the vechiles into the right area. Once that's done we start the truck. Soon as the truck is done then we stock.
bad,Some locations need work in the management department unfortunately. However target is not a bad place to work. The guest are friendly and cuz not big problems.
bad,I honestly hated working at target because of the management team I had. If they were better I'm sure I'd have much better things to say. They were so focused on sales that they didnt care about the well being of the employee from what I saw.
bad,I hated working at target because of the management team the were unfairly treating black people never actually available when you need them and bad decision making
bad,"very quick paced work. Should be able to stand for many hours in the day. Super big place, you meet so much people. Very good atmosphere to work in with lots of people."
bad,"Lack of management skills, no team work everyone is selfish and only looking to make themselves look good while constantly demanding for more out of you the worker. Everyone is miserable, the environment is poor."
bad,"The philosophy of ""foot in the door"" does not exist for Target. Management is very degrading and favoritism is rampant. Pay is competitive. Review time is lacking."
bad,"Target in a decent employer when you first begin looking into the company, but when you actually began to work for the company it seems like your requests often fall upon deaf ears. The management staff is not at all concerned with the employees needs,and they often short people on hours"
bad,"This was my first job and at first I really, really enjoyed it. But as time went on the managment began contradicting each other and I felt as if i couldn't do ANYTHING correct. My first day was on a black friday and I didnt really get trained until the shift after that. I tried very hard and did my best so i was better off than some of my other coworkers- but not by much."
bad,"Team leader play favorite and very rude, make too hard and stressful for work with, sometimes too much pressure !!!!!!!!!!!! , but is good for experience."
bad,"•	Routed Secured documents to various departments for approval"
bad,"Unrealistic expectations to upsell merchandise, and streaming packages, commision is falsified and you never recieve it, great employee discounts, get to work with target LOD AND MOD team members"
bad,At first it was a nice easy going job but as time goes on the manager switches and is always complaining. Doesn't consider anything and will constantly threaten to fire you. The employees and customers are nice though... usually.
bad,unloading and stocking.management treats you unfairly.does not give you hours.i worked there and i was lucky if i got 20 hours a week.Team members don't work as a team it's always one person doing everything.
bad,"Not a good company to work for ,, treat you like a number not like a human been ,OM's are not trained properly,  ,its all about numbers , there is a lot of favoritism,  or dislike  to people ,to get them fired , once you are a target, OM's go after you to get you out of the company , most lively  theperople that are targeted  are the ones that had been there the longest , they want new people  like temps and seosonal so they can pay them less and  and no benefits."
bad,Too physically demanding. Unrealistic expectations for the job. Daily schedule is hard to change even with reasonable need for change. The hardest part of the job was the fast paced moving of materials.
bad,"You don’t get paid for the amount of work they expect from you. No room for advancement, favoritism and political. Very little training. You are not set up for success. Mangers are very rude and condescending."
bad,"It's a stressful environment even though they say they are one team it's more like everyone is out for them selves. Very political in a sense that if you are liked by management you will be okay, but be careful cause that can change in a moments notice and you will be coached out. They can also make your time at the work place  miserable."
bad,"While Target offers great discounts and benefits and coworkers and customers alike are pretty friendly, it is ran horribly. Favoritism and selective leniency is evident in their practices. Managers tend to be rude, unreliable, or plainly unprofessional while regular, hourly employees are responsible for taking up their slack. Lastly, Target claims to and appears to be very diverse, however it sings a different tune behind the bullseye."
bad,the overnight ETL is not willing to work with college students on schedules forcing them to quit. Has favoritism within the team. Leadership staff has no idea what communication is.  When you try to talk HR about issues they do not seem to want to help and then there is retaliation when you have an issue with leadership staff.
bad,Unreasonable expectations with insufficient resources to complete the tasks required.  Work life balance is a joke and not enough stores to make commute time less.
bad,I got a concussion during my last months working this company. It took a really long time for me to heal from it and even though I provided doctors notes to management they accused me of lying and using it as an excuse to get out of work. It was an incredibly disappointing experience and I would recommend anyone looking for a job here to be wary of management.
bad,The management was poor and unorganized and non cummunication and not enough work hours and they wouldn't work with me with my school hours. And they wouldn't get my check pay correct and on time it just didn't fell like a team when there's a team going on how can you lose
bad,It is what it is. A big corporation that constantly tries to keep up with its competitors but forgets its employees and steadily increases the workload. It's good as a college job and if you want to advance the opportunity is there.
bad,tough place to work.  All management are very young.  Corporate office continues to make poor decisions.  Management requires ppl to kiss their butts.  vision of overall company  is poor. there is no job security.  a manager who has been with company five minutes can use their person opinion and fire someone whom has worked 10years in company
bad,"At first working for Target was a great experience, helpful team members, helpful management. Once I started to get bullied and harassed by a team lead it didn't matter how many times I talked to the ETS, HR, or manager, nothing was done. Management is very passive and tries to downplay everything. Harassed?! No, that person is just going through a lot right now... well then they must have been going through a lot for 10 months straight because that's how long I was harassed and bullied for... ridiculous. I would never recommend working for target to anyone."
bad,"Don't get me wrong, Target is a great company to work for. I am an APS at a target and make around 16.00 $ per hour. I promoted within three months and received a 4$ pay increase.The negatives about the business and my job title as an Asset Protection Specialist is that the job is dangerous."
bad,Not the best place to work. Great supervisors that actually helps one through any problem. Low pay not the best to fullfill a career out of. Easy work but hard labor.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is my team members tat work for me. The team is great!!"
bad,"A typical day would be ringing up merchandude for guest , returning merchandise processing redcard applications. I loved my coworkers we were a team and we helped each other out alot."
bad,The worst job I ever had. They are very unprofessional. The management team suck. I will not recommend no one to go there.
bad,Expected to be available at any time for extended calls in order to give instructions. With no pay. Not recommended at all.
bad,"I didn't work for target very long. Only for the christmas season. Black friday was crazy. Being a cashier, you are standing in one place for most of the day and that is not good on your back. I didn't really get to know any of my co workers and I cant even remember my managers name. If your not good at keeping up your bagging speed while engaging the customer they will ride you hard"
bad,"Truck unload"
bad,"i use to enjoy working here but it got bad. management is screwed up. everyone wants to flex their muscles when they are LOD for the day. There are too many chiefs and not enough Indians. They dont want to give you full time, but they work you right to the brink of you becoming full time. They expect you to cover 2-3 sections of the store. Avoid target. you could work at walmart and do less and get paid the same amount than working at working here and having them work you like a slave."
bad,"Working at target was not what I was thinking it would be, Im not an early morning person, and so getting up at the crack of dawn was horrible for me."
bad,"They do not care about the employees as they say they do. They show the guest they are here for them and including us, but behind doors they are very rude, mean, VERYYY stuck up, gossip too much, and last but not least has very potty mouths."
bad,I worked here for 3 1/2yrs great money but no family life and the company cares nothing about you. Work all holidays they make you work hard for the money and the place will stress you out
bad,"It was first job. I hated being in the food court, but I enjoyed working in the bakery. I learned a lot from being in the bakery. Hours were terrible. Management is was even worse. Didn't care for it much, but it was a job and it was my first, so I did learn a few things."
bad,"It is well known how Target Canada failed, however at the store level at least at my store, everyone from the store team lead(store manager) to the lowest team member did their very best to help the store succeed. I worked for two of the best managers/supervisors I have ever had. The best part of working at Target was my fellow employees, in only two short years we became a very close group."
bad,"the people i work with is absolutley amazing! but as for corporate, thats another story. girls have to go out and bring in the shopping carts from outside, the smallest girls too! WE are forced to work holidays like on thanksgiving and if we call off we will be terminated!"
bad,this place is best for college kids and the elderly looking for a little cash. not recommended for long term career.
bad,Great Company to work for. Look out for employees grat benefits
bad,"+Positives:"
bad,trust none at this company everything u do or say even off the clock will be used against you
bad,"Not the best place to work at all. Everyone pretends to care, but in reality they are just there, at their convenience. The raises suck BADLY! Don't recommend this job to nobody. They look for any excuse to get rid of you. Good part time jobs ONLY. Go to school, get a degree is my best advice."
bad,"At first, as a team member everything was all good. I started to promote going into a higher level such as Team Leader and Sr. Team Leader and that's when it all went down hill. Unethical behaviors from Executives as well as non store level Executives led me to quit. Every team member I spoke to hated their job and wanted to quit. Sad but true story!"
bad,"Well if your hired on when they do a big seasonal job hiring, don’t expect to be told that it was seasonal, instead you will find out by not being placed on the schedule anymore and the managers won’t have the guts to tell you when you ask them straight to their face, instead they will talk bad about you behind your back like middle schoolers. Terrible managers at the Arlington, Tx area."
bad,"I had many problems with a manager and went to both HR and also our store director about these issues and she didn’t even get a slap on the wrist. She talks down to the workers and all around has a terrible attitude. This caused me to decide to leave my job, which I loved, all because I felt I wasn’t being taken seriously."
bad,The management will drive you crazy. You must wear walkies and they keep constant tabs in your location. They call you while in break asking how long you will be. I couldn’t deal with target any longer
bad,The job was ok they was just a lil to stress for me .but the managers was ok.it was seasonal so I really did get to do alot or get to know some of the employees
bad,"I had worked at 2 different Target locations, and had very similar experiences at both. I was encouraged to apply for promotions several times, only to find out I would be left hanging. Overall, executive management was discouraging and harsh, minus a couple who truly went out of their way to support me. District visits usually consisted of criticism with no solutions to improve. With their current restructuring, Target is cutting entire teams, requiring less people to do more work in the same amount of time. Team members are burned out and unappreciated. I had witnessed several break down and cry in frustration due to lack of support from management. As team leaders are told to advocate for the guest, and not the team members, I don’t see morale improving anytime soon. For the last few months of the job, the pay was really the only thing motivating me to stay."
bad,I would help when truck was unloaded and sort clothes to the right departments. Once clothes were sorted it would be taken to the sales floor and stocked where it was needed or belonged.
bad,Management gave the impression that they did not care about the team members until their bosses were visiting and they had potential of getting in trouble. They are not open for suggestions on what would help improve sales or the environment.
bad,"If you're going to try and work for this company I will warn you about a couple things. The first being that after the season is over you may end up only getting an average of 8 hours per week. The second being, at least in the ship from store department, you will hardly work in the department you were hired to work in. Otherwise, the people are good to work with, except some managers, but you'll get that at most retail jobs. Overall, it's not a bad place to work."
bad,I applied for electronics or cashier but during the interview they told me that they were just trying to get someone for cart attendant. Thinking that getting my foot in the door was a good idea but regretted it a month later. They say I'd be going through a probation period then moved to another position but as that has passed and they admitted that they need a nights cart attendant I do not see a way to advance. Most of my co-workers like Target but I have been met with nothing but deception.
bad,"Not a good place to work. They cut your employees out from under you every season so you are stuck with all the duties of your subordinates. "
bad,"I have never worked with such miserable, unfriendly people in my life.  It was a seasonal job and temporary but I felt unwelcome there by everyone in my department,"
bad,"Fast--- in needs to be done. Fun-- sometimes games are played in the break room that are ""childish"". Friendly--- mostly everyone fits into the culture there, other wise you wont be kept or hired during the interviewing process. However, most of the ETL are fake, and talks behind everyones backs. So trust no one."
bad,On a daily going to work at target was abusive and stressful. The manager was rude and dismissive. She as well as most of the team leads at the thornton super target made you feel as you were the hired help.
bad,management is young and have no warehouse or people skills. very little communication between departments and shift to shift which is critical in this environment. operations managers back stabbing and sabotaging each other visibly daily . 
bad,"When I started at target in 2005 it was a fantastic place to work.  Over the years, management has steadily decreased to the point where you don't feel safe even going to work.  Management either fabricates or just out right lies to point the narrative to what ever they please. With no checks from HR or upper management."
bad,I only took the job with Target because I haven't worked for over a year. Truth is the problem wasn't with the storm themselves it was the management who didn't know what to do. Overall it wasn't the worst job I ever had but I'm glad I'm not there anymore.
bad,Not a great place since it was really stressful and cutthroat. The management wasn't the best and a lot of times felt quiting because of it. I wouldn't recommend it at all to anyone that I know
bad,"I worked the retail side of target, aka soft lines and the company is in a stage where they are developing soft lines because it's the second sub department to bringing in the most money or something of the sort. If you have ever worked retail you will believe me when I say that you need a large staff to effectively operate the sales floor. Soft lines has no structure. There is usually two to four members for the entire department pushing truck, maintaining floor cleanliness, operating fitting room, and running go backs. It can be difficult to handle all that especially when you have soft lines TEAM MEMBERS, not visual merchandisers, but regular team members, who are also expected to be visual merchandisers. In addition, on busy days members are always being called to guest checkout and being pulled away to smart huddles a majority of the time and it's as if no one is staffed to maintain soft lines. If the soft lines department wants to operate like an H&M or Zara or any typical fast fashion store, then more hours for a larger staff and actual position levels with matching pay need to be implemented. I believe that is why the turn over rate is so high because a majority of the time the team member is literally overwhelmed. "
bad,"I learned alot working for target. I moved up quickly with the company, started as a barista and became the  food assistant within the year. Managed a team of about 12."
bad,Working at Target during peak season is rough. You have specific quotas you have to meet everyday. If you don't meet those high quotas you will eventually be released from the job. For the amount of work and effort you put into this the pay should be much better. The whole 12 hours you work is inside an eighteen wheeler load with no ac or fans (extremely hot during the summer). They do give you breaks and gatorade to replenish your fluids but i wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. The best part of this job was clocking out and the benefits.
bad,Was out sick for a week and got fired for it. Called in each day with a fever of 104.2  but they don't allow people to be sick. Also didnt understand when we had to use restrooms
bad,I worked there for a year a some months and I loved my co workers and the new people I met but they didn't have mixed crowd of workers if you get my drift I was accused of stealing twice once because I talked to a girl who was stealing and I had no idea and a second time because someone gave another ethnic coworker free food in front of me and I didn't pay for it like why would I pay for her food just because I was standing in line to order my own and lastly when I tried to transfer to a different state they screwed me over and told the new target that I was fired when I worked my full 2 weeks before I even left. Now I can't even get a job at a target anywhere and I have no idea why.
bad,"The job was very friendly to its customers, and treated the customers very well. I would come in 5 a.m wait at the door to be buzzed in from a manager in which most occasions it will take one manager 7 minutes to open the door because he would always be in the back helping unload the truck when he supposed to be up front opening the door. After being buzzed in I would go straight to the back and unload the truck battling floor associates for a pallet jack to unload the truck because it wasn't enough. After unloading the trucks I would bring pallets of merchandise to the floor along with my other co-workers to down-stack according to aisle. I would say the hardest part about working her would be battling for equipment when everyone has a time-limit to get the work done. I thought management was horrible at target, communication skills were not set high. Working there a manager named Mike J. would make a lot of discomforting jokes and say a lot of negative things to me. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was getting to know different associates around the store."
bad,"-Overworked."
bad,This place is a legal sweat shop. I lost 25lbs in 2 months. Always lifting overworked and you better hit your numbers or your gone. Dont get hurt or your gone. Except for a few good ones all supervisors are pricks. Treat you like your stupid and its never good enough..work harder even if your at 100% most co workers are awesome. Only reason to stay is the pay if you make it past your 3 months..
bad,"When I first started working here I loved it. My co-workers and management was the best. A few years have passed by and it is definitely not the same. Although I do not plan on working here for the rest of my life, I feel as if a worker should enjoy the working experience. I no longer like working here and I do not feel respected."
bad,"If you want your hours cut to as little as 8hrs - 16hrs a week, and you don't like the ability to eat or pay for gas.  Then this is the company for you.  Upper management will work with you and realize it takes 2 to 3 people to run your department on a 40 hour schedule, but have you do it on a part time schedule.  Then act surprised your not fulfilling expectations."
bad,Terrible place to work... managers will throw you under the bus at target for their own personal gain.... glad I don’t work there anymore... work somewhere else !
bad,They have no regard for the employee. They’ll do anything in their power to give employees the least amount of hours. Around the end of the shift they tell everyone to be at the time clock at the time they’re scheduled to leave and not a second more. They also think it’s alright to schedule their employees for 3 hour shifts for the entire week. Unethical and disgusting management who treat employees with little to no respect.
bad,"Target 3433 the worst place to work. OVERWORKED, never thanked, harassment from upper-ups. RUDE & RACIST customers. DIRTY break room DIRTY bathrooms. UNORGANIZED CONSTANTLY . understaffed since I been working there and probably will be after I'm gone"
bad,They treat their employees like garbage. You are made feel like you don't matter. Back breaking work with no appreciation. I felt like I was being spoken down to management
bad,They don't care about the well being of their employees at all! They work you like a dog and have no gratitude for hard work! They play favorites and are clueless to the needs of their employees.
bad,"The absolute worst job I've had! Management and supervisors were terrible at their jobs, they would expect ONE person to organize 6+ rows in one hour by yourself with NO HELP, while also stocking products, helping guests, and doing go backs, and then have the audacity to say you don't want to work!? IT IS NOT HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO FINISH ALL OF THAT IN ONE HOUR! Customers were kind I'll give them that, but co-workers and management were downright FAKE and RUDE, I really only liked 2 chill co-workers my whole time there and that's it. HR just sat doing nothing while being immature, and also too lazy to make employee badges, while employees were working hard out there for not enough pay. I literally had zero motivation to work there everyday, it was not fun, my legs hurt from too much walking and bending and I'm only a teen, I had to leave in order to save my mental health because it was too much stress and very depressing, imagine working there for years? I would NOT survive. Management is also harsher on the younger workers for some reason, like what? do we not have feelings, stress, and exhaustion too? they would downright blame you for every little thing such as not having your u-boat next to you at all times. no support AT ALL, very strict, very tiring physically and mentally, and they have so many rules that make no sense. Supposedly you're supposed to remember EVERYONES name, when I can barely remember what I ate earlier, and also bring locked items up to the cashier everytime for EVERY customer, that really wastes time. Also I was hardly in the makeup section? because they"
bad,"Pays well enough and sometimes gives you enough hours. Extremely high turnover for good reason, everything you learn in your first week will be replaced with a new, most likely worse, system in less than 3 months."
bad,This company doesn't care about the people working for them. The few good people are overshadowed by the bad ones. Instead of reteaching employees they overwork ones who put in effort.
bad,"Target Trumbull West is the worst work experience I've ever had. Management does nothing while the team members make them look good. Can't trust most people there, including HR. I've worked there for 4+ years and no one ever shows recognition. I have all the same workload as my team lead and for team member pay."
bad,All they do is gossip here they wanna know your personal business so they can gossip.Management sucks Communication skills is very poor none of the managers seem to know anything about how to run the company..  and if they don’t like you they will cut your hours  no matter how much of a hard worker you are .
bad,"When I first started working the job was a typical retail job, wasn't great but was a decent job. My first manager pushed me hard but fairly, then they restructured management. Suddenly my manager was some new hire manager who had told one of my coworkers during their interview that she didn't know anything about electronics and only was supposed to be in charge of the beauty department. Most of my coworkers were a joy to work with but we frequently would complain about the way management was moving, with many of my coworkers being threatened to get fired if they did not get 12 hours of work done in a 4-hour shift. The final straw for me was when a manager who wasn't even in charge of my department pulled me aside and accused me of having an attitude problem and going missing for an hour even though plenty of people were available to vouch for my whereabouts for that entire shift. She wouldn't give me any information about what I had been doing wrong and just continued to yell about this imaginary problem, when I was finally out of the office I talked to one of my coworkers about it and they replied with ""oh she does that whenever she's in a bad mood, she'll pick someone to yell at to make herself feel better"". I could not work for an organization that allowed management to yell at and threaten to fire employees simply because they were in a bad mood. HR was unable to help as they were friends with all the managers and were biased because of it."
bad,"Took a part time job, 20 to 25 hours per week. Never reached the 20 hour mark. 4 hours one week, 11 another. They kept hiring and hiring. No one was getting survivable hours. "
bad,"terrible because cashiers were supposed to get carts, clean washrooms and clean spills up while being screamed and complained at by customers that didn't realize it wasn't our fault for not having the stock in and management wasn't there to help out with the situation"
bad,"There not worth the trouble."
bad,"The job offer was for 40 hours a week plus occasional overtime. At orientation, right before the start date, they informed us that they are only guaranteeing 20 hours a week and not 40. They will also require mandatory overtime. Basically they're expecting you to keep your whole week open because they could only need you for 20 hours or 60 hours, you won't know until a few days before."
bad,"I mentioned many times i was not able to work specific times because of school but i was scheduled for those all the time which i either had to find someone to work them or tell them i couldn't come in which looks bad on me. It was not a fair place to work, when i first started they promised they would work around my schedule but never did one time."
bad,"I was at this target location for only two months. Absolutely horrible. Management isn’t great and they continued to allow customers to sexually harass my team! When you tell them about the situation they have no idea how to handle them. Some customers would even come back to the store. Hours continued to be cut, you were required to do a lot in such little time, and management always had attitudes."
bad,Working at the Distribution Center was literally the worst job I have ever had not even close. It's a good paying job but definitely not a career! If you work over 20 years in that DC you will be in a wheelchair and need a mental ward. Management is absolutely terrible and they will work you to the Bone and then some. I would never recommend this job to anyone!
bad,"My experience at Target started alright, and quickly deteriorated over my two year period working there. There was a significant lack of communication to the team I was a part of. Several times we would show up for an unload, and the trailer wasn't there, or was delayed. A few times we were told to go home; Costing us a part of our pay for that day. We were not compensated for showing up ready to work and being told to leave. "
bad,"my coworker would sell credit cards to people who couldn’t understand English and the higher ups never cared! They rewarded him for that awful behavior!"
bad,"Target is an ok place to work, but if you don’t like anyone constantly telling you what to do then do not apply for target. Also the hours are not good a lot of people at getting under 15 hours and less, but if you are looking for a full time job don’t go to target only managers can get full time everyone else is part time"
bad,"We have the number one store in sales in the South East Region yet they are giving the team members 10 to 15 hours a week. Not all team members though. If you are a new you will probably get 40 hours a week. We can’t keep a store manager, so the store is ran by leaders( if you can call them that ), who don’t even communicate with each other. We are always hiring but yet there are never any hours."
bad,The bullied me out of my 2nd Job because they thought a “Failing Company” was a “Competitor” which is false. They do not work with you if you have a 2nd job. They do not schedule enough people & management gossips about other team members in a negative & inappropriate way. The Target in Dearborn Michigan are very unappreciative & no room to grow.
bad,It is a great company to work for very welcoming company the management needs more hands on team leads hours were always solid until they seasonally cut the hours
bad,"They offer you U$ 15.00/hour but give you 2 days to work every week. Now nobody is a full time employee, they want only part time people. After 18 years working for this company they trow you out."
bad,"Hostile work environment. Unless you were in the ""click"" of management you were generally ignored. Horrible support from other members of management. Only concern was making bonus. Employees made to give guest false sense of enjoyment. If the customer had even slightest complaint discipline was swift up to and including termination, no accounting if one was right or wrong, there is no wrong from guest side."
bad,These people are pure evil and will try and suck all the life force out of you. Not very supportive just want to make your suffering greater than theirs.
bad,This company sucks! And I used to love shopping at target they constantly cut the air and lights to “help the community” but in reality they just want to save money and it gets really hot! They give bad hours and the people are really mean and sarcastic! Night shifts are bad you get out till 3 am cleaning the whole store!! Not worth the pay when they treat you bad!  Since the store does not make sales they push and push you to sell it’s insane m.
bad,its a warehouse so its hot when its hot and cold when its cold. it isnt fun or anything like tha. did it for almost  years. it pays well. they have ok benefits.
bad,"Obviously it depends on the location you work at but the company doesn’t give af about you. Corporate changes things so much and half of it doesn’t make sense and slows down the process of what you’re trying to do. Corporate takes too much emphasis on helping the customers out that they forget NOT EVERY POSITION should be assisting customers. Even if you work in the back, somehow you end up helping guests when it’s not your job to."
bad,you only get 5 hr work schedules and nothing can really be completed in 5 hrs  when you don't complete said tasks within the time frame you get reprimanded
bad,Not worth telling my stories because this won’t make a difference. Target is not worth the stress it come with. I would not recommend working here to anybody.
bad,"They will get you in, promise you lots of hours..you will, at first get hours, and then..poof..no hours, they will set expectations way to high and unrealistic....I get no benfits, or vacation time,due to lack of hours available to me.training,..forget it..maybe a day..then ur on your own.This  has by far been the worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,"Between the rude managers, horrible coworkers and entitled annoying think they are better than you customers makes for a pretty horrible place to work. Hands down the WORST job I ever took"
bad,They work you to death and only get 2 small breaks in a 12 hour shift. You always feel that your job is on the line. You break your back for them and they could replace you in a second. While the managers get a big bonus for Christmas the hard workers get a ham dinner. You would think a big company like Target would give a gift card or SOMETHING to show appreciation especially during the holidays when you are mandated
bad,"I've spent 4 years at this store and it's gotten worse and worse. Once a manager got transferred to that store,that's when everything started to go downhill. The management sucks and they treat the employees like garbage. They're as fake as they come. If you're a Front of Store Attendant, good luck doing you're actual job,since you're too busy doing everything else. Don't apply to this store. Anything is better."
bad,"Please note the date of this review.  As of the beginning of 2019, all former reviews by others are now completely irrelevant due to the corporate ""modernization"" roll-out.  The Target culture has completely changed to something akin to Amazon and Walmart awfulness."
bad,"Target will only hire (and interview) applicants that have put completely open work availability. seriously, if you have any skills, go elsewhere. they prefer unmotivated workers that will be fine with whatever they get scheduled and not question things like lack of benefits. The pay is terrible, like all retail work. the ""grunt"" workers, the sales associates, are typically high school and college kids, or those few older adults that never amounted to anything. joining management didn't change anything or my opinion either. left as quickly as possible."
bad,"If you're not part of the 'in-crowd' at this Target location, meaning you don't always bend yourself over backwards every day of the week for any Team Leader in the store who approaches you, then you're gonna be pressured to one way or another in order to maintain a good amount of hours. "
bad,"I started as full time my first year and it was going fairly well. When our STL and HR ETL changed and I was approaching the time for me to receive benefits they dropped my hours to at the most, 12 a week. I had my healthcare for a few months before I needed to move and transfer stores but they made up excuses that kept me from transferring. I lost all of my benefits and my job because of this. I called them frequently to discuss my leaving and if any chance of a transfer seemed plausible. Every time I would receive either one of two answers: “I’ll call you back by (this time)” or “They’re unavailable right now, you can leave a voicemail and they’ll get back to you.” I never had a formal meeting about my leaving. Very unprofessional, did not care for their team members, you could sacrifice your life for them and they wouldn’t be bothered. Your best is never enough for them."
bad,"This was once a great first job to have, with high starting pay and a positive work environment that fostered personal growth. However, recent decisions have rendered Target a shell of what it once was: a business solely focused on profit at the expense of worker morale and development."
bad,Management is not willing to work with you to switch work areas.. terrible place.to.work unfair treatment of employees. People favored. Just not a pleasant place to work
bad,"I work for a target at cityplace market store and they would treat their employees like trash. Some of the managers belittle their their employees. For instances, a co-worker was humiliated infront of everyone saying she isnt doing her job and is not getting the amount of target circles she was assigned to. And the worker left crying. Also management is trash too"
bad,"started work, got trained in an area i wasn't hired into. Never met my manager or team leaders, was trained for 5 minutes then left as a cashier for the rest of my shift not knowing anything about the register and no one around to help. Then first shift I had I wasn't taught anything about what to do and was expected to go about my job without being trained with anything."
bad,"In the beginning the place was great, got 36 hours a week and everyone was very friendly, like family. After the modernization things started going downhill. My wage has not changed except to what people get off the street, I get no health benefits because my hours don't average 30 hours a year due to drastic hour cuts(talking around 15-20 hour cuts per week for months on end.) I recently quit and am fighting for 15 hours worth of vacation time they approved before I knew I had to quit, I have a paper trail. I've been on and off the phone for around 6 hours trying to fight for this 15 hours. Typical day involves having work centers shoved down your throat for 5 hours, while they continue to push for more work in less time. Would not recommend. Save yourself the hassle and don't start. They like to pull you in with the whole 12.50 an hour but you'll only get 15 hours a week, and I was someone who knows more departments in the store than anyone."
bad,"The work that is done there is not worth the pay they give you.  I had 2 position with no raise, shoe dept and visual merchandiser. Managers act like they care but really don't. Nothing is confidential. If you called out sick, the whole entire store knows why and what happen. Favoritism is definitely a big problem here."
bad,"The managers in the Paramus, NJ Bergen Town Center, had poor management qualities and lack of better communication. I hope they replaced the team with up to date management. Because they really did not care for the employees they only cared about how to please corporate when they would make their stops at our store. Seriously, corporate if you stopped by as a surprise, a surprise you will get."
bad,"I work her currently but the managers are horrible and hardly know the job. They are always hovering over you all day long and complain about every single mistake you make no matter how small. You get no sick days and doctors notes don’t mean anything to them and it still will be counted against you. They don’t care about nothing but the business and not the people who help make it run, they claim to be big on safety but don’t do anything to make you feel safe or change what needs to be fixed until someone gets hurt and then say it’s your fault and the pay is okay I would say it’s good for a person who is trying to get on there feet but not a place meant to be a career. They deny me of my class exemption to go to school after approving others but I missed a week for school and came back to a write up that almost got me fired like they offer to excuse you from this stuff but didn’t . They take there time when it comes to approving days off and they have days where you work very inconsistent hours but it’s so much stuff you would have to contact me to get more info but I’ll tell you the truth"
bad,I worked in this store for 3 years and l had to start taking anxiety medication. Never have I been treated so poorly and never have I felt more taken advantage of. you can work you butt off and it will never be enough for them. They sit in their offices all day and complain that nothing is done when they literally never communicate because they would rather eat fast food and gossip then interact with the team. I highly recommend looking for a job elsewhere.
bad,"Used to like working here, but with the recent changes it became worse and worse. Management are complete hypocrites who expect employees to do work they can't even do themselves. Execs are extremely unprofessional and have a sick game of trying to make female team members cry by yelling at them in front of guests. Execs will discipline team members for taking a 32 min lunch then turn around and take a 3 hour lunch themselves. The execs are never anywhere to be found on the salesfloor & spend all their time in their offices while hardworking ppl do all the work and receive no recognition. Would not recommend this as a place to work to anyone!"
bad,"They up the workload, cut hours, send people home and then want other departments to pick up the slack and then you get punished when you dont finish everything."
bad,"Target was a temporary job. Being treated like a work horse, not getting paid well. No benefits. Not full time work. Had very stricken rules about customer relations."
bad,"I have more than enough to say. Alot of what I have to say isn't good. Management at store 2527 is horrible, also they have a high turnover rate because of Management."
bad,Store managers have lofty ideas on how apparel business should be run with no definite experience in fashion retail. Not a great work environment. Very little emphasis on new team member and team leader training.
bad,"Very unprofessional."
bad,"When I worked at target, the management was absolutely horrific. They played favorites and if for some reason didn’t like you, it would make life difficult just to show up. They expect way more from you than humanly possible, very understaffed due to cutting corners. Stopped allowing overtime, and there are no vacation days or benefits unless you’re a manger or have worked there a long time. If you’re looking to cashier forget it, cashiers hours are absolutely terrible here and have gotten even worse since I last worked there. The moral is very low, it feels like everyone’s spirit has been broken by corporate working them like dogs and high expectations. Customers that come in are rude and snobby. The only good thing about working here is you’re paid well and if you’re working a full shift you’ll get scheduled breaks throughout the day."
bad,"I held both the Sales Floor and Cashier positions. Both were simple enough, I restocked shelves, made sure the stockroom was in order and helped guests who has any questions. As Cashier I checked out items for the guests. Managers seemed easily frustrated and did not care if i had genuine questions. I just never quite enjoyed my time there as much as "
bad,I just started working at target and I am already ready to quit. It is a very unwelcoming environment and not the most helpful when it comes to new workers. I got hired as a full-time position and yet I only get scheduled around 15-25 hours a week. That is not enough to even pay a portion of living costs.
bad,"Management at my Target store is very poor. Too much pressure put on team members causing a lot of stress, along with cut hours due to mismanagement of OT."
bad,I liked working here because I love makeup. but the management was not so good. every time I would need a day off or a couple and I would submit it like a month advanced I would always get denied and the days I needed off I had to switch with someone or had to call. very poor management. and some can be rude to you.
bad,The company has been increasing its overall wage but cuts the hours of the employee so it is no different than making the lesser wage! Company doesn't care about its employees like they advertise.
bad,You will love this job if you don’t want to advance. If you do want to advance make sure you become managements pet. If and when they have hutles it’s only to let you know what a bad job your team is doing.
bad,I had pretty bad hours and they wouldn't move me or give raises. They had me work 3 days a week for 8 hours for 9 an hour. I worked before the store was open and they didn't give you a lunch break just two 15 min breaks.
bad,"I have never in my life I called up to see about my application they told me to at the end of the week when I did I had to wait on phone for 30min to talk to HR, they gave me that the was other applicants better for the job and they had no more open positions. But I was on indeed and seen they had many job openings just posted today. When I asked her about those she got really mad and told me she did not care what was posted and they keep applications for 90 days and she told me if they feel like a deserve it they may or may not call me back don't hold my breath."
bad,Through out the years I worked at Target I had many managers only a few who could actually do their jobs well. The turnover rate for employees is really high which reflects directly on the lack of proper management.
bad,Management was awful. Customers were awful. The amount of work for the amount of pay is atrocious. They do not care about you. They will not train you right and then they will yell at you for not being perfect.
bad,Management was very negative at my store. They would talk down to people and make them feel terrible if you didn't succeed the impossible work load that they gave you.
bad,"management is a complete joke, smile in your face and laugh behind your back, lie to make themselves look good, most employee's steal and lack in their work."
bad,"I was a full time employee and they started scheduling me 4 hour shifts twice a week, then when they fixed that they’d schedule me till close then open the next day on black friday"
bad,"I've been there four years. I unload trucks by hand and sort merchandice to be stocked in the store. It used to fun . Now ,theyve changed the process. They've ran off a lot of the long time team members and new comers too. Trying to do a lot with few people. Not fun any more."
bad,"I always thought working at target would be cool but it’s not . I was hire on as seasonal part time ( when I applied for full time but whatever ) . I work 1/2 times a week WITH ONLY 4 HOURS EACH DAY. They have a “app” system that doesn’t work so you can pick up extra work . I’m usually a cashier and i don’t mind it there tbh , but they put me to work at toys hand no idea wth i was supposed to do . Heard other new employees say they had no idea what they’re doing either and half the time when they need help they can’t find people from their department lol."
bad,"There is absolutely no space for growth here!  Every position that requires managing, is only given to people that are well-liked by their superiors, which makes it hard for people who actually deserves it."
bad,"This was part time. They timed your checkout speeds, The management thought I should work more hours. They could not understand I was taking care of aa family  member full time."
bad,"wasn’t the most fun but was laid back, if you stay to your task and job the hours pass by. There’s also stressful days were it seems everything is dirty and going wrong"
bad,they are stressful but they have some type of benifit and they are a ok place to work and no hours to work with at all but u get discount on the hoildays
bad,Working at Target was fast paced and they always switched up your job so you wouldn't get burnt out just sitting at a cash register all day every day.
bad,"I have nothing good nor bad to say about this company, i worked there for so short a time i honestly couldn't even give you a proper opinion of this place."
bad,I have no review for this company worked as a contract employee for short time just wish it could’ve been longer or a permanent position offered to stay
bad,"target was a seasonal job where i work part time on the midnite shift most night and some weekend in the days, i stock shelves , sometimes would be a chashier"
bad,love it love it love it more than mcdonalds and life its self if you ever Tripp in Walmart I hope you land in target  I wish I could be there now red red everywhere
bad,Target was a really big place to work at so it was kind of hard to walk to your lunch and still have enough time to enjoy your lunch. Also the breaks were 15 minutes but more like 5 mins by the time you get to the break room & you didn't really had enough time to rest with all the hours standing on your feet.
bad,"I enjoyed my role as PATL, and had a great team with me. The hardest part of the job was losing the job when they shut down. I learned how to lead a team, do daily price changes within the store etc."
bad,The target distirbution center is a good place to work but if you get injured they will try the hardest to have it not be there falt. they will even pay off doctors.
bad,Worked in backroom. morning shifts were cleaning and stocking early morning delivery. afternoon-night were restocking the entire store. workloads were not adjusted to manpower. instead they were based on sales. often i was only person on duty and if I failed to meet the 1-hour timeline i could expect a manager to check in and ask why my numbers were off. most of the days were spent frantically running from one end of the backroom or across the store for cosmetic room. as well as being on call if a customer had a question about inventory or furniture which fell onto the backroom to answer the call.
bad,"Never worked for a company that does not acknowledge restroom and water breaks.  In this position, there was a great deal of under staffing and handling employees like little kids, instead of adults.  The most enjoyable part for me in this position, was customer contact and appreciation.  It was a pleasure assisting guests.  The hardest part was to work continuous hours without a scheduled break.  Reporting unprofessional behavior to management went on deaf hears."
bad,"Targets lack of management makes it a poorly run company to work for. The managers have attitudes and feel superior to the associates, making them feel less of a person. The pay was good but this is not a place I would ever recommend working."
bad,I didn't really work there very long. The people I work with were very good at helping me. I learned things about making food. I just did not enjoy the early morning shift.
bad,Salary is very small. Minimum wage.  Work is hard - every day you should to lift up so many  havy items. You have about 300 hundret customers a day..  Schedule from 7 am to 12.30 pm. Customer's are often  rude . Managers are on the side of the customers always.
bad,I was a part-time employee with max of 10-15 hours on a weekly basis so really have not got lots to say about this company. It was minimum wage. I was not with them very long as they were an american company and closed.
bad,"This is a good starting job if you are anywhere from 16-18 years old. This place will give good hours and expect little from you. Do not get trapped here. The biggest thing I saw in my year of work here was that people got trapped. They settled at Target because their schooling was overwhelming. When they settled they pushed all of their hopes and ambitions aside for this job, not this career but this job. Do not settle for Target when you can do so much better in life."
bad,The reason why i dont wanna work there anymore cause they judge me. They would cut my hours. They would talk behind my back. I just feel uncomfortable working there.
bad,Target was a nice company to work for but I didn't get the opportunity to work full-time. So I would rather work at the Target warehouse instead of the store.
bad,I was a cool job i got to chill in the back room and talk to all the employees. I hated to go in the freezer and re stock. i wanted to run the back room but they never let me move up so i quit and found another job.
bad,My time at Target was short and brief that I am unable to fully recollect or recall my experience here. My job only lasted a few months during the summer time.
bad,"target has no integrity with the managers they hire. I was told that the schedule was one closing shift per week and every other weekend off... well after 4 months I have literally had only one full weekend off. and the rules depend on who is LOD, and the pay is terrible so there are various reasons I would NEVER recommend target to anyone."
bad,Lack of staff poor expecatations and given a lot of labor with bad pateint and customer attitudes. Also pharmacist arent dependable and often rude staff. District managers just enforce metrics and not care
bad,The company says that it loves and willing to work with the employees. However they don't really care about their employees. The company only cared about getting the product out of the door and would make the job harder on everyone
bad,You dont get weekends off EVER unless you request them. Reviews sucked. I didn't enjoy this job at all.   Major drama always. would never work there again. When you trained someone it was a waste of time.  Black Friday was always a NIGHTMARE. It was never a smooth transaction for them.
bad,They don't listen to you very well and schedule harshly and not to your schedule. The managers and leaders aren't very attentive and don't help but when you ask for help they complain.
bad,"I worked here a little over 2 months. I had to wake up at 4am and leave at noon, it got exhausting after a while to the point it was affecting my health. The manager was incredibly rude and impatient and seemed to forget I was new."
bad,"Be careful here, management is terrible,  you work four 10 hour or three 12 hour shifts, lots of overtime opportunities,  but managers get bonuses on the amount of freight moved, so their incentive is to push the team as hard as possible,  getting hurt or having any type of issue with how this place is run puts you on the list of people who aren't quote ""Target brand"" and managers will actively harass these people into quitting or nitpick your work and fire you over minor infractions that they observe while they stand around hawking you, I have worked here seven years and watched as they systematically eliminated anyone in management with a heart, degrees are required of managers, but in any field of study, so it is baffling why they think a 23 year old with a bachelor's in english can manage a warehouse better then people who have actually done this type of work for years, they claim to be a great workplace, but have switched to the new corporate scam where temp worker's are doing the bulk of the work for half the pay of target employees, and dangle being hired on after ninety days, but most people get strung along for up to five or six months without that job offer, typically quitting in frustration which leaves you constantly training new people on how to do things, and makes it harder for you to keep your numbers high enough to avoid the scrutiny of managers, they have really lost their way here, best advice is to keep your mouth shut when they ask you what you don't like about the job, this is a trap where they then use your dislikes to label you a negative employee and"
bad,Hours suck been there 10 yrs and not once got promoted and I have work in every department I can't  think of .They don't appreciate all your hard work
bad,"I loved my job at Target. My coworkers were really easy to get along with and for the most part, guests were nice. I got a few really weird complaints. I had none my first 2 and a half months then in my last 2 weeks, I received 4 really odd and minor and absurd complaints. So just be on the top of your game and you'll be fine. But I would even watch that. They didn't even give me a chance to defend myself and corporate is no help either. Don't work for Target."
bad,"Hard work, inadequate pay. Increasing hours with tenure. No room for advancement in career. Typically employ lots of young individuals in early 20's. Low retention rate"
bad,Hours suck been there 10 yrs and not once got promoted and I have work in every department I can't  think of .They don't appreciate all your hard work
bad,It's great workers there but nobody acknowledge them the job sucks the only thing good about the job is sometimes they feed you.other than that your being over worked and under paid sometimes they give you slit of hours but you'll get in trouble for going into overtime
bad,They only hire young women and treat them better than males. They fire the males at the end of the season and keep the females. Males are only there to push carts.
bad,When working here i felt isolated from all of my coworkers due to the nature of the job.  anytime i needed assistance i felt as though i was a bother to them.
bad,Target doesn't care about there employees.  They give less hours to there employees and give more work to them and expect them to get it done in that time.  I was there for over 23 years and basically they lost all they good and dedicated employees who worked really hard and did their job and was very detailed and they didn't even care.  The bottom line is all they care about are the profits and their bonuses.
bad,"Target isn't much better than Wal-Mart when it comes to how they treat their employees even though they try to act like the better option. We were overworked, underpaid and under appreciated."
bad,"Very unorganized management, they can hardly keep track of what'd going on with their workers. Told them about a vacation prior to working and they agreed yet still put me on schedule."
bad,"I absolutely hated working in retail. Immediate supervisors were found to be significantly lacking in personal skills, as well as basic managerial skills including conflict management. Immediate co-workers were really friendly and supportive."
bad,worked at target and eventually moved my way up the company. ultimately would recommend as a first job but not permanent employment. better opportunities can be found else where
bad,"Working at Target wasn't the best. The management was terrible and I felt that I was never valued. The job was very rewarding but yet not so much. Some people made my day just as I made theirs, but their is always going to be one difficult person that i'd have to deal with. I would constantly get hit on, or other customers would ask me for my number. I didn't feel safe at all! Working in retail is not something i wanted to pursue. I want to work with children."
bad,"it was a fun environment. They are flexible with scheduling. Most employees provide a friendly work environment. also the pay was fair, along with plentiful hours."
bad,"Boring job that doesn't offer much of a career path.  This is a good opportunity to get some experience, but then move on to something more progressive."
bad,"The location I worked at had some stupid managers who took peoples hours just so they could get a bigger bonus check. The managers talked to the team members anyway they wanted to, there was no respect. They also gave minimal raises to keep their own pockets full."
bad,"Nothing nice to say about BWW in Braintree. Management was horrible, customers were horrible, money was great just like any serving job. Other than that, this is the worst company I've ever worked for."
bad,"Upon being hired, I was promised to start as a Cashier then be promoted to GSA within two months as well as a pay raise, that never happened. Was promised at least 25 hours a week, was scheduled only 24 hours a week a few times. Terrible place to work for."
bad,bad place to work and i dont recommend working there at all the work load is overwleming and they give you no time to do it and then they are on you the entire time
bad,Was a good place to work stayed here for an good time period I enjoyed the team I worked with and it gave me a lot of experience that will last with me forever
bad,There is good and bad about the job. the pay and co workers are great but management and how your treating is a big con. New managers would really help the place.
bad,Management was poor and the relationship with their employees were sub par. Very busy work place that forced you day to seem shorter. Fast paced and gave you a healthy workout.
bad,"Terrible job. If you need fast cash or are in a bind, it'll work, but you wont enjoy it. Long hours, hard work, and the people there are dead beats."
bad,Was told I would get at least 30 hours...I'm down to 16 hours..managers have pets who get to stay late..get's the overtime...one coworker tries her best to injure me on the job..I'm moving on...
bad,"From my experience at this location I noticed a lack of communication, respect, and a stressful workplace environment. Annual pay increases were mere pennies and the comradery between my coworkers and I was what kept me there for 2 years."
bad,"Target is not a company for growth and development. The executive leaders does not have the mentality or the leadership skills to help you succeed. If you're looking for  positive change, forward movement or growth this is not the company for you."
bad,"Terrible. They will not work with you if you get sick and have serious issues with health. "
bad,"No I would not like to write a review for target, it asks you if you would like to but doesn't give you an option not to, so excuse my French but ******"
bad,"I dont know if the reason why they didnt train me very well is because my previous job was a Combo Cashier Clerk for Safeway. "
bad,I loved working here when I first started. The second you become interested in being more than a cashier/sales floor rep. be prepared to be used and tossed away. I would never recommend working here!
bad,"I very much enjoyed being an cashier , I loved the environment of Target . Along with , I learned how to work fast along with being able to manage completing a task in a mannerly way .  My most enjoyable part of working at Target as an cashier was meeting kind guests. I am unsure of what I found the hardest part of my job . I got along well enough with all coworkers ( Team Members ) along with my managers ."
bad,"TCF bank was an okay job to work for, they're very strict on reaching sales. Your job actually depends on account sales. other than that the job is okay."
bad,If your aren't aiming for anything more than being a regular team member this job is perfect for you. Co-workers are great people.
bad,"Was not very flexible with hours. I was hired for seasonal but never worked on a holiday. I was pregnant while working there and witnessed 3 women loose their babies while working there from being over worked even when they told them it was too much.I had an episode where i almost feel out while pregnant and they i had to go rest for a second. Instead of the managers asking was the baby and I okay, I was yelled out for sitting down while on the clock. Mind you I was having trouble breathing."
bad,"It was just a bad experience for me, but it may be different for others, so I say give it a try. I did learn a lot. There is not much else I would like to say about this company"
bad,I can't say to much some of the people were nice but most of all they say they are all about the family but really they don't care they want the most work and dedication from all the employee's for the least amount of respect.  They don't care about the people that work there they just want the most money..
bad,"I worked at Target for a short time. I was employed during the construction of a new store. Once the store was built and set up, they fired 90% of the employees."
bad,I did not like working for target for their lack of support from management.  The hours were horrible if you had any at all.
bad,Helping customers Find Things for their everyday need. Getting shipment out in a timely manner and staffing the floor with people who has great customer service.
bad,What I remember from target was that we were always getting yelled at for small things we weren't getting enough credit for things.
bad,it a job for little teenager that get out school. but it okay job you have your ups and down there. I like discount that they do have it good. and I like they will give you a day off.
bad,Typical day at Target was assisting guests in  a fast and friendly manner.I enjoyed working at target but needed more hours
bad,"Initially starting off, one of the best jobs ive ever held as far as the environment, I give it  a 10 out of 10. A typical day at work included unloading a truck of merchandise in the morning at the start of the shift and working to expedite everything to its place on the floor as well as in the back. I learned that while working in a environment, full of people that aren't exactly focused and rounded as you are especially when it comes to why you clocked in, that you definitely have to rely on self motivation instead of a the motivation the company usually brags about giving, but is only shelled out towards employees who hold favoritism. Management was .extremely horrible, secretive and vindictive so it was definitely like working with a bunch of kids. Considering it was Target, there were definitely weren't any hard parts such as far as the work, unless you were a hard worker. Most enjoyable part about the job was being able to have free reign over the work I was doing without constant supervisor from an upper level."
bad,"Very poor business management in Canada.Great team members,co workers were the best part of the job.I will miss them all."
bad,"what can I say its target, its a good place to work if you don't want to make it a career, fun environment, fun customers, cool people"
bad,"I cannot speak for all locations but this one has poor management that has led to low morale. low pay and not enough hours. They expect open availability but there isn't a set schedule. shifts will vary. there is no opportunities for career development unless someone has left. ""expect more, pay less"" is how the employees are treated."
bad,I started and finished the one project and then the company went out of business. It was a very disappointing opportunity.
bad,I learned a lot of warehouse skills and customer service also. I also was fortunate too meet a lot of professional people.
bad,"Horrible treatment of their employees at this store specifically, forced to work at odd hours, never appreciative of hard work."
bad,I don't know why they put us in a kiosk with little to no inventory. We were also heavily understaffed making us had to travel far away with no travel reimbursement.
bad,Target was a unique complex company to work for.  Target provided good customer service to their consumers through aid from their retail sales associates.
bad,it was great to be there for high school or college position but not as a career.  They are very demanding and don't let you take break when you want.  it kind of sucked like this review
bad,Terrible company to work for in general. People (customers) are absolutely nasty and need to make the environment friendlier.
bad,"I worked there a year and got a .9 cent raise, after getting employee of the month multiple times. While making minimum wage."
bad,"Sucks badly... Horrible management"
bad,This job is great to get your hands on diverse departments and you have the ability to move up to managmennt
bad,Get paid minimum wage for a full 8 hour shift. No room for advancement.
bad,"They always cut the seasonal workers hours shorter than every one elses. didn't notify me about being hired only seasonally."
bad,"not much to say, to many chefs and not enough Indians. there was maybe five hand held scanners for 30 people to find the proper locations for new stock. Also if it rained or snowed the lot attendant's just couldn't find there way to work, so that feel on me the new guy. I didn't mind just give me a place to  keep my clothes for working in the elements."
bad,Sucks the life out of you. Would not ever recommend this place.
bad,"Was good because they helped you out with the days off and the guidance you needed with the job."
bad,not a place where hard work and dedication takes up to the top. all executive politics. to make it up you need to dress nice and do whatever your boss suggests.
bad,"No opportunity for advancement, repetitive tasks, poor management"
bad,"Retail environment. Clothes, shoes, food, etc. Expect the unexpected when working with the public."
bad,"I have been unhappy the 2 years I have been employed at target. Only 1 raise a year, no paid holidays, only time and a half, if you actually work the holiday! They try to enforce ""fast, fun and friendly"" but then you get ""coached"" if you're being too friendly, and told they want you to work faster, when you're already working your fastest. The management tries to push off their responsibilities to the team members. There is no ""leadership"" whatsoever!"
bad,They don't appreciate individuals for their contribution to the bottom line. Very hard core criticism from upper management.
bad,Over worked under paid and blah de da bloop blah I am doing this for someone and idek what to write
bad,fast pace and very busy environment high in customer service
bad,"I started part-time at Target and was hired on full-time. I will tell you that it gets worse through time. You will see so many managers getting trained and transferred, and all the petty high school drama between boyfriends and girlfriends. Corporate does not do a good job interfering with leads and team member relationships. This is a typical retail environment. So expect rude customers and team members. Oh, and the only discount you get is a measly 10%. They will work you hard for less pay than Wal-Mart. And shorter lunch breaks. Advancement will be difficult. It was probably one of the worse jobs I've ever had."
bad,"Report to work at 3am,to un load truck. Then go and restock store. Management was on your back about time lines. No people skills, would yell and belittle other employes Co-workers was afraid of management. Meeting time lines and early hours. Nothing enjoyable about job.."
bad,"Target in Oaklawn, IL is not a good job. They do not know how to treat the people that work for them."
bad,"Not too bad benefits but the company isn't the best. None of the bosses did anything, but expecting everything to be done by the associates."
bad,"The co-workers were very fun to be around, but management had many preferences and they never communicated with each other so rules would always change without anyone knowing."
bad,"This place can either make or break you. It shows you the expectations of others, customers and co-workers alike and how much they're willing to take or give."
bad,I worked in the shoe department. I would go in sick as a dog and the manager of all the clothes would yell at me because all my work wasn't done. I was the only one in the department and was doing the best I could considering I was sick and had lots to do.
bad,"I worked there nearly 12 years. If the economy hadn't gotten so bad I never would have stayed. As a first job during senior year of high school it was a great place. Got paid every week, cashed my check there, got all the hours i needed & then some. They were always busy, it kept you on your toes. It's sole purpose was independence from parent & got me my first car. "
bad,A typical day at work you meet many different people and its a workplace of diversity which I loved because you got to know lot of personality. The workplace had a fast pace which was great and I learned working there that team work or effort is good. Always try to help those in need if you lend a hand. The co-workers there were fun I enjoyed and got along with everyone. The most enjoyable thing working for target is that the perks they awarded us when we did a great job.
bad,"STL, HR ETL never available they hide in there offices. Team lead for hard lines tattles on everyone. Other Team leads take 45 minute breaks instead of 15 minutes. Team members do all the work with no appreciation team members do more work than these team leads and they get treated with no respect. Most of the Team Leads sit at TSC all day. This store has really gone down hill... It used to be pleasant."
bad,"The workers behind the scenes are the ones that make Target an okay place to shop.  However, workers are rarely acknowledged. "
bad,"•	Cashier/Guest Service "
bad,it was great till I was relocated and then my pay dropped. the people were nice as for the bosses its a hit or miss
bad,Great team..horrible management (they do nothing all day)..rude and impatient guests..only way to improve is by brown-nosing
bad,"I was mainly on the cashier ringing for more than half of my shift.I learned how to work the cashier because this was my first job.The management sucked, they weren't responsible and they didnt care about how the store was doing.Most of my co-workers were old so there really wasn't any conversation between us.The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the lines short.There was ABSOLUTELY no enjoyable part of this job."
bad,"I haven't even started working there yet and this has been my experience thus far. I submitted my application which took forever, you would have thought I was applying for the CEO position, there was a 300 question survey. Then I got a call a little more than a week later, good. They said they were setting me up for a phone interview. I waited for about 30 minutes after the phone interview was suppose to take place to call and inquire why I had not received a call. The person conducting the interview had no clue she was suppose to be calling me. so she called back and I did the interview. She said at the end sorry, but they aren't hiring right now. oooook. so a couple days go by and I get another call, for another phone interview. I take it and they say to come in for an interview. I do and go through the process and then get told I have to complete another survey on the computer at the store, took about 30 more minutes, ok. So then I get offered a job as a temp on the overnight crew for remodel and the pay is 9/hr, not bad, but not good. She says ok, someone will call you and let you know when orientation is next week, bc we start remodeling on the first, ok. so two days later I get an e-mail telling orientation is on the third, AN E-MAIL!! what if I hadn't checked my e-mail, would I have been fired for a noshow, before I even start?? so I call and inquire about when the orientation is seeing as how I was told it was sooner. she tells me it is what ever the e-mail says, but she isn't the HR person, bc the HR person is conducting an orientation. She says she will let her know"
bad,managed backroom projects and employees. worked second shift.
bad,"For a first job, it was very difficult to work there. There were a lot of unreasonable co-workers but there also had amazing co-workers too. The hardest part of the job was staying way past our the closer' shifts had ended because management wanted everything to be spotless (even though that was the overnight employee's job)."
bad,Management has absolutely no idea how to run a business. They can't stick to a schedule. They told me I was going to be put on the schedule but they never did actually put me on the schedule.
bad,Poor compensation. Too much stress for minimum wage. Don't waste your life here.
bad,"Its a great company as a whole, but in my experience the more friendships you have with management the more hours you get."
bad,Greta team lead and team memeber is what makes the day best at target
bad,"As an overnight team member, I started my shift at 10pm, unloaded a couple thousand piece truck for 2 hours, then took the freight to the floor. On the sales floor, I would stock shelves until 6:30am. My co-workers were awesome. The management was horrible. The superiors overnight never lifted a finger to help in the process, and the management dayside would rather point fingers than to take responsability for anything. When it comes time for yearly work performance and ""raises,"" management lies on the reviews to give only pennies as raises. The management is what makes target a horrible company to work for."
bad,Corporate was not fair to employees. Was told I was going to get a raise and I didn't.
bad,-learned how to keep calm when hostile situations arise
bad,"had to go in really early morning and get out early afternoon, Had the rest of the day off."
bad,"Your supervisors yell at you when they are stressed. Double the workload for what you are paid. Make a good attempt at a good culture, but management does not follow."
bad,Typical day at work was never know what to expect
bad,"Low paying job with a company that treats you like you are replaceable. Even though I had 8+ years of service experience, previous retail management experience, and a college degree, they refused to pay me more than minimum wage or give me opportunities for advancement. I quit as soon as I found another job!"
bad,"It was a nice job however they would only give me 4 hours to work in a whole week at times, that's terrible for anyone trying to actually make a living on their own."
bad,"Job Location is too far of a drive, fast pace low pay and management is unfair would not give you credit for production. management don't know how to talk to people"
bad,"Men now allowed to use women's room. Not for me. If this is what Corporate TARGET wants to impress upon its customers and workers, they are going to lose a lot of great workers and once loyal customers."
bad,depends on who's at work most management are very negative an spiteful.  The most enjoyable thing about work is seeing the guest. I've learned alot like not to trust my coworkers.
bad,Target wasnt so bad. Its funny when I look back in the past. I actually dropped out of college to work here because I needed money. Huge Mistake. It was a lesson learned
bad,I would start my day by as soon as I come in zone and face items on shelves’ break down pallets on u boats and fully restock my assigned aisles . I love to go out my way to help any customers that have any questions
bad,"I would NEVER recommend Target in Murfreesboro, TN to my worst enemy! The management at this location is absolutely AWFUL. So awful that 3 of the manager’s bosses left in the last year and a half. So you know it’s pretty bad."
bad,"I learned to be a team member that is willing to help my team members. There was a time when I had a customer that ordered a drink but she was in a wheel chair and she needed help with her drink, so I got the drink for her."
bad,"good work place. always something to do . learn new skill , learn about all the trends in the electronic dept. fun people alolt of help in the store, managers are fair"
bad,It was for holiday seasonal work. Enjoyed the time spent with employees. Early days on shift. Not enough hours for everyone. Would have liked to have been able to continue after season ended.
bad,I Actually Liked Target Distribution Because It Defiantly Wasn't A Bad Job But All The Managers Are Riding Your Back To Where Your Uncomfortable And The Job Its Self They Tell You That They Will Hire You But They Get Rid Of Everyone After The Holiday Time So I Felt Used.
bad,"unload a 2000 piece trailor and stock items before timeline, you learn to work as a team here, management is not professional in my opinion at my store,co-workers are fun to meet, hardest part of the day is not making timeline for items to be stocked, and most enjoyable part of the day is your briefings; lunch breaks."
bad,"The particular store i worked for was not managed well. It was not an enjoyable experience, The people I worked for were disrespectful. 1/10 would not recommend."
bad,well a typical day at work would ushally be crazy . they wont scedule enough people to work that day and it would be super busy so we would have to have team members from softline come help us finish are job.
bad,I have learned how to work with others.  Skills to move up on the job
bad,They started cutting hours dramatically once they raised the hourly wages but other than that it was a good job. Managers weren’t the best but they sufficed.
bad,"Typical day would be enter the store greeting my co worker and management with a smile on face,  the harder  part about my day is getting on the truck doing the holiday season because  i was only one"
bad,"Like the environment and people there. But the management is poor. I was there for 5 year's. When I first started it was great. But the longer i was there, the more it went downhill"
bad,"Work with wonderful co-workers, what I liked about the company everyone work together and help each other to get the job done."
bad,"Target provides a wonderful working environment. A typical day at work would begin with a team huddle starting with recognition and discuss work duties for the day. Overall target had a regular routine set scheduled once in a while we had unexpected changes in work routine however; I had learned to adapt to changes and work with what I had. "
bad,Great place to work!! if you enjoy meeting new people everyday
bad,Working at Target is stress free. The system is very easy and the co-workers and managers are very helpful and always listen when you have some concern either work related or personal. The team are united.
bad,Target was a nice place to work at nice people just on holidays it get crazy target have good play friendly people what i learned about target that like you to be open have a good posstive  note on you shoulder
bad,"my target was a bad store to work for. The praise workers who for get mad at customers. They would never never answer the phone, well they did just to putthe phone down, so they wouldn’t hear it ring"
bad,"If you want to work at target apply to another. The one I worked at does not  believe in promoting people, the only was is if  you are working your butt off to get noticed or your kissing butt. If you go to school they will only work with you if you open availability for the days your not going to school so forget about asking for set times. But that is mostly upper management. The coworkers are awesome!"
bad,Hourly paid employees cannot promote to management. They hire management from outside areas. I worked there for a year and half had an idea to promote red card sign ups. Went to the store manager he just ignored it. Went to the regional manager who told the store manager to test the program. The store manager  came to me told me to print out the materials at my own expense and he might try the program.  I was a cashier and was not permitted to cross train or do anything to promote. It is mindless work and management is run by frat rejects. Good company to shop terrible one to work for.
bad,"Run! While you can.  Management is like twelve year old kids. Playing and joking around like junior high school.  Empowerment, us given to the employees, so management, don't have to do squat,but walk around and text in their phones all day."
bad,They start you will nice hours as does any other place then slowly drags you down from 35 hours to 25 hours then after 4th quarter (holidays) don't even bother you'll get be lucky enough to get 10 to 15 hours
bad,"The management doesn't really seem to care about you. Ive worked here for a while and its just not a fun job. I wake up and dread going to work. Also, no point asking them to only schedule you certain times. They do the opposite."
bad,Got treated  very bad  got called an idot an got spit on not cool an the managers sucks at there jobs try to tell them but they never listened  there's anything about that kind of work I didn't have e to be disrespected  an I didn't say just walk out
bad,"The customers are overly entitled and my store was severely understaffed. We would have so much work to do but they wouldnt allow overtime. If we didnt finish preparing everything for online orders, we would get in trouble with management. Fulfillment just couldn't win over the christmas season."
bad,"The tasks handed to me are extremely unrealistic but are expected to get done within a short amount of time. There have been team members that have hurt themselves because of how demanding the managers are and don't report their injuries because they're afraid of the reprocussions. If the unrealistic expectation isn't met, you are at fault and will be punished by losing hours, and even switched departments without explanation."
bad,Target is a decent place to work if you are in high school or college. It is not an ideal job if you want to be appreciated and climb the ladder. Management makes sure you stay stagnant.
bad,The target. I worked for had a favorites system. The team leads also treated you like dirt. They abused their power into talking to you like you were dumb. I dont really recommend working at a fargeg unless you know your local target has a pretty well set community. Mine didnt.
bad,Target was a low paying job that made me feel bored and judged. Management was rude and they don't care for the employees. Theyre very unprofessional.
bad,"I worked at target for more then 10 years, in the beginning target was a fun, fremedly, place to work , then with the years all the company change , they concentrate on sell and they don't take care the employee, my store manager tell me, "" if  I don't like the 10 hr per week  they give me that I can be replace , and that she have line of people waiting for my position . very disappoint it  with what I heard"
bad,"I have been employed at Target casselberry for a year and 5 months now .I'm still stuck in the same position that I begin with only difference is that I'm making a dollar fifty more and the management there are a bunch of young kids who think they have it all figured out and they have not a clue on how to be a good manager. There's a lot of favoritism that's going on at that place "
bad,"The schedule were inconsistent, and the pay was low. No benefits. The management didn't care about you. You were just a person on the floor moving merchandise."
bad,"A typical day at work included maintaining the fitting rooms and my assigned areas  cleanliness and stock. "
bad,Though I was treated nicely by customers (which is surprising) I was treated very poorly by management. They did not care for my personal input or for my welfare. I would rather go back to Walmart vs going back to Target. Plus they don't support our troops...Not cool!
bad,"I constantly bust my butt to get my work done at target. I've worked at 2 stores consistently, and picked up shifts at 2 others in the area. They're all the same. No one is in control of everything. All anyone cares about are results. And if you dont give 99.999998% of the results they're looking for, you're vilified and threatened with hours getting cut."
bad,"Just don't do it. You won't get hired on, they'll make it seem like you will. But you won't. Save yourself and apply elsewhere. You have to work like you're making 25/hr and only making 12-14/hr."
bad,It was okay working there loved some of the people I worked with but others were lazy! Management was awful they would always be in cash office or Starbucks together and leave one person alone in the front having to worry about helping guests and drive ups including other minor details and if no one was there to lunch you you’re the one that gets in trouble and if you hit your 5th 3 times you get fired even if it wasn’t your fault so they expect you to leave a guest and go to lunch so you won’t get in trouble
bad,Worked at target for going on 4 years .great work atmosphere I still work there just looking for a second job certain work areas are great but partime hours not for me looking for more .managers don’t care will allow employees to stand around and talk and be hard on hard working team members
bad,"Horrible management, never listened to my hours listen, toxic work environment, unhelpful management, sent you on wild goose chases for help in HR, less than understanding about anything"
bad,Poor management and poor work conditions. I got injured as a cashier and was told to get over it and move on to the next guest. Constantly getting screamed at by guests angry about something that was out of my control and the managers always sided with them and then yelled more behind closed doors at you. Finally stopped scheduling me and letting me leave early so i was able to find work at a better company. No room to expand your skills either.
bad,"I was a full-time student when I applied, and I specifically asked for a part-time job. I never worked part time here, even after countless demands to do so. There is a RedCard Quota, and if you do not meet this quota, there are consequences, such as losing your job. Management at my location was awful, and the supervisors act as if they are better than everyone there. There is little to no training, as my training took only 1 hour and then I was left on my own. I wanted to quit after my first week."
bad,"I got hired to be a “style advocate” i haven’t been on the floor once and i’ve been working for about 3 weeks. Always calling on the walkie asking for location, make you everything else BUT the job you were hired for. Managers are just bothersome"
bad,managers would give me a lunch break over an hour late regularly and they dont let you sit or bring water to the registers. your average retail job with a forced Corporate Fun thing every once in a while. free food in the break room sometimes though
bad,"This company has so many people working for it that every one only got 4 hour shifts 3 days a week tops. If you were closing you only had 1 hour to clean your area perfectly and if your other closer called off, you had to do there sections as well. They never tried to get anyone to cover the call out and if you didn't get everything done in your 1 hour you got in trouble and your, already minimal, hours cut."
bad,I started working here about two weeks ago. I have not received any training. Managers will not respect my school schedule even though it was discussed during my interview. Managers are mean and very unprofessional.
bad,This job isn’t stable they start you with many hours and then cut them drastically the most you’ll get is 20-25 hours a week unless it’s an holiday. On holidays they take all of your time. No recognition no incentives.
bad,"ETL's at my store are a bunch of kids on their phones most of the day who like to tell you what you're already doing way before they say to do it. They act like they take your ideas and feelings into consideration, but never follow up or act on it. Mainly stayed for the pay"
bad,I enjoyed working with the staff and learning.  But management didn't really listen to employees concerns. Especially if you wanted to continue to work for the company.  No matter if you were reliable and hard working.  They will lay you off and tell you it's in the best interest of the company.
bad,Not what it was a couple years ago.  Work ethics and culture are very poor now. Management does not care about you and they only care about making money and not so much there employees. Sucks that its going downhill use to love working there !
bad,Do not work for target unless you are a student or retired. They lie about paying a livable wage when the more you get paid the less hours you will get. It seem like all team members that are hourly are expendable and part time. There’s always a hire sign when you walk in. They have no benefits what’s so ever. So unless you only need to work 20 or less hours because you don’t have bills to pay or food buy or have to pay for rent don’t work here!
bad,"Fast-paced work environment with pressure to keep shelves pristine (picture-perfect presentation), beyond basic procedures (like keeping shelves clean and perishable products fresh). Not for anyone who struggles with mobility or cannot lift more than 15 lbs. Pay starts at $10.50/hr, which is above the federal minimum wage, but not nearly enough to stay above the national poverty line or cover the local cost of living as a single source of income."
bad,"managers only cared about their own bonuses, store not run well at all, poor scheduling, not enough security, constant shoplifting, sales floor employees given work of two people"
bad,"A typical day at target consisted of ringing people up and trying to sell them red cards, making sure everything is clean and stocked and asking questions over the walkiee"
bad,"Work here if you want to be constantly stressed, and deal with trashy people for management and constantly be mentally and physically exhausted! Target was a horrible place and is nothing like the pretty and bright store that you come to buy the many things that you need for home. Working here is like being in middle school all over again with cliques and tons of negative energy and gossip. Super unprofessional place. Trash at its finest and that is an understatement! That 10% team member discount isn’t even worth half of the stuff you deal with on a daily basis."
bad,Love working in my department. Love my coworkers. However managment and overall way the company is running now is very cold and unpersonal like. Makes you feel like no matter what you do its never enough.
bad,I would not recommend this place to work at. They work you like a Hebrew Slave and only pay enough for you to buy a loaf of bread to eat on for the rest of the week. They have expanded daily job duties for each team member but does not want to pay the employees the correct funds for the extensive amounts of demands. 10 out of 10 would not recommend unless you love to be miserable then this is the corporation for you!
bad,this job made me absolutely miserable. They do not listen to their employees at all. They leave you to do impossible tasks all by yourself with no help at all. The harder you work the more they give you to do and the less they listen.
bad,Overall experience a 2. Rate of pay is good but not enough hours are a turnoff. The workers don't feel appreciated. It's very stressful work environment
bad,"I didn’t last long. I quit because they don’t train you good at all. I was given 2 people who were suppose to train my Friday day neither was there so another team member showed me the ropes but not enough to fully understand the ends and outs of everything. The typical day for me was folding hanging clothes back up and putting clothes back on the sales floor were they belong. Job is boring a bunch of walking back and forth doing nothing, once you straighten out your department it’s nothing to do but to keep it straight. If you apply for sales they will make you work cashier for back up even though that’s not what you applied for and I feel if you apply for a positing that should be your only position. Overall the pay is good but they don’t TRAIN. And the other co workers aren’t to welcoming. Management sucks. Our store didn’t have a LOD"
bad,"When we had our old manager and HR, working there was amazing and so much fun. I was actually able to provide for myself and my family. Now I am lucky if I work twice a week. The only thing they care about is cutting everybody's hours to make their payroll ""look good and impress the men upstairs"". It;s a joke."
bad,"Target is a great place to shop but thats it. When you work at target you are required to work long hours and fornminimum wage. Once you have cross trained in other departments, management will move you around yet nit recognize the work and talent you have."
bad,Being a target team member has provided me hands on experience in customer service. Informing guests of company policy / membership is one of the important roles I provide. Assisting guests for item location online or in store. Answering questions and providing as much needed information to ensure guests are helped to the fullest. Training new team members and showing them all there is to know about the company. Answering telephone calls and transferring them to other departments in the store. Providing all important return policy information for specialty items before purchase is complete.
bad,"They treat you like race horses here. As soon as your injured, they they throw you out in the pasture to be shot. The management is horrible. Read the fine print before working here."
bad,I love target  but working there has not been a good experience.   There is no consistency with your roles for your position.   The management is detached and the schedule varies week to week.
bad,"I have been working for Target for collectively 3 years now. They have not ever and will not ever show that they care about you. When they fire you, they refuse to show documentation on the reason for termination. They treat their team members very poorly. I was once threatened at work and HR told me I was being childish and she forced me to say out loud "" I was not threatened"" so she would not have to file paperwork on the matter. They will schedule you to work during school and church hours, and they make it your responsibility to find coverage at work. If you can't find coverage then you are expected to show up to work and miss your educational and religious requirements."
bad,I met life long friends but I did like the management. They were rude and did not help their team out . They were lazy and there were not enough diversity among management.
bad,"When I first began at Target, it was the best place to work.  They were flexible with your scheduling needs, the management would have fun ""huddles"" at least once a week to engage the team, and the atmosphere was an overall good feeling.  Since the new CEO has taken over, Target has become more ""corporate"" structured.  The company will no longer work well with those of us who have various scheduling needs, they no longer want full-time people who have staying power, and having fun is out of the question.  The only enjoyable part of the job anymore is the team members that I've had the chance to interact with.  Mostly now, there's no personal interactions allowed unless on break or meal times.  The stress levels are higher now due to management coming down hard on all work, no play."
bad,"People say not to bad mouth an employer because you'll seem bitter, So I'll just say; I'm grateful I have a job, but the culture and management really need some work. I came in as a temp, the experience was rough  because the training is virtual and we're in cubicles but can hear everything or hardly learn due to many distractions -- It's a lot of talking, phones ringing non-stop while you're trying to gain all this knowledge in 2 weeks virtually with hardly any explanations on the purpose of systems being used and why we're using them. You can't really learn the way you should and no one says anything to the people that obviously don't care if they learn or if anyone around them learns. Also, lots of favoritism shown as well. The leads, smes, etc aren't accommodating. They sell you the idea of the job more than they try to make sure the culture is comfortable for everyone. If you don't know anyone there, you're out of luck. Concerns or anything you say will be ignored unless they like you or know you personally. Job looks good on paper and that's it, but not worth the stress or headache. If you're desperate, you may be tempted to take this job. But, unless you want to go through much adversity you should apply elsewhere and if a temp service comes to you with this job, don't take it."
bad,"Don't work here unless your a student. Otherwise you'll be upset at the hours they give. They feel as though they can talk to you any kind if way. Most mangers are ok, some are very racists. Cut hours if your sick, even with doctors note. Fire you without out even telling you! Have you doing things that aren't in your job description. Then Cut your little bit of hours without warning."
bad,They treat employees horribly and promised hours but you’ll only get between 12-17 a week. You’ll be lied to and expected to complete 10 hours of work in 4 hours. The higher ups change things constantly yet have no clue how the jobs are actually done.
bad,"The management promotes, awards, and grants leniency based on personal relationships with employees with favoritism playing a huge role in the way people are treated. Leaders and team members are allowed to be very close friends, live together, and even maintain romantic interactions at this place of business, however only some* are warned, transferred to separate departments or even let go depending on their relationship with leaders. The team is often understaffed to cut hours and overworked to maintain the expected level of progress, sale goals, and store projects. The most enjoyable part of the job are the guest that shop with us, and the love of accurate guest assistance."
bad,I personally didn't enjoy working at target... most people that I've talked to that have worked there will say the same thing. The management wasn't the best... and they don't give you the hours they promise. They expect 8 hours of work done in half the time
bad,"I only worked there for 2 months and they threw me to the wolves. After 3 days of training, they put me in their  biggest section of the store. Needless to say I wasn't prepared. There were many things I had to learn as I went through my time working there that were daily need to knows. The management tended to blame me for not knowing and when I told then nobody trained me on it, they gave me ""coaching"". They also have poor work ethics when running this specific store. They were ""understanding"" when I called in for bereavement purposes, but in that same week I got into a car accident during my lyft ride to work and the head management over soft lines told me I had to come in or be terminated. Yup, after being in a CAR ACCIDENT,  I either come in or lose my job. So I came in and left early because I needed medical attention and the other L.O.D of the night sent me home BUT told me my job was in danger because they have and I quote ""a business to run"". I get back and hear they had been writing me up for these instances and others unknown to me so I got fed up and quit! I have never in my life felt so targeted at a job but as I was going through this I was told from other employees that I wasn't the only one they did this too. They were understaffed when they hired me because every one was quitting due to being overworked and management. The pay was great but I'll never work for them again."
bad,"They ask what hours you want/can work but THEY pick your hours, not flexible as they claim,  the gstl (guest service team lead) I was a cashier, THEY decide what you get for a raise..you may get 25cents you may get a nickel..for being a local company the work environment wasn't very good, lots of favoritism"
bad,"Working Cashier/floor sales can be both fast paced and very boring, depending on the day and position. Its easy work but can be challenging dealing with customers at that time of year."
bad,"The employees who worked at Target, constantly needed to gossip about one another. There was a lot to do in the high traffic store, yet everyone is too busy talking to each other. If you are a hard worker, do NOT apply for Target because you will be picking up everyones slack."
bad,Target is the worst place to work they force  cross train and pay veyr little money. i applied for a operator position and by my second week they threw me on top s registar without training.
bad,Poor care for their employees no hours to complete work task and horrible management . No respect for employees wouldn't give us on break or lunches on time . Took our lunches last minute manger expected a lot but didn't want us to give us enough time to complete task
bad,"It’s not the most pleasant place to work but it’s a job. They is a lot of favoritism, working hard gets you nowhere if they don’t like you. Its good for temporary not long term."
bad,Working at target tech seemed exciting at first until you realize you have nothing to do most of the day. The pay is not good and even selling a phone isnt as easy as it seems since the software always breaks down
bad,This was actually my first job as a teen several years ago. Can't think of anything redeeming to talk about. Associates were very cliquey. Not sure if this position still exists.
bad,I've been working at target for almost 2 years and we have recently got new store managers that dont know what they are doing. They dont know how to talk to their employees. Ended up being a lot more stressful than the job was worth
bad,"A lot of high school like behavior among my coworkers. Drama being started instead of maintaining professional environment. Verbally abusive coworkers, verbally abusive boss, hours are chaotic, if you want to work a closing shift and then work the very next day at 4am to 11am-noon, they will try to make you do that. "
bad,I use to get 40 hours a week but they no longer allow people on the team im on get 40 hours. i only get 25 at the max now. the hours changed and it does not work with the schedule i have. the management sucks
bad,The ones that do work are not being recognized. No structure. Got discriminated as a woman by leaders. No action from HR or any other leaders. Training on the computer but no training on tools/equipment you work with.
bad,"Hired on with the promise of 40 hours a week, almost everyone except for a select favored few and the Team Leads/managers got cut down to between 18-12 hours a week. Issues with a particular manager we’re never resolved, despite at least 9 people speaking to HR and expressing their concerns over this person’s professionalism, demeaning comments, and irresponsibility. The problems seem to only be at a particular location, as the entire Target system itself doesn’t reflect the chaos at this location."
bad,"Target seems like a good place to work at first but the management expects too much from employees. They constantly cut hours and expect you to do the work of 5 people at the same time. It is stressful and you never know how many hours you will get so if you need a certain amount to live, I'd recommend getting another job in addition.. but be careful because even though they approve your availability, they will continue to schedule you outside of it and make you feel like you are wrong. Don't recommend long term"
bad,Target was ok I don't like how the stockers only get to work 3 days out of the week. I would probably never work there again. The hours were ok but not great.
bad,I helped open the particular location I worked for. It was fun great group of people to work with. Plenty of opportunity for growth in the conpany. I worked in the cash office.
bad,"I was a Cart Attendant. I was in charge of restocking the cart coral, emptying the trash cans, cleaning the bathrooms, and assisting with spills. Towards the end of my time with Target I started running into problems with the management regarding transfer, hours, and cross training. It took an unnecessarily long time for the transfer to go through by which point I had found another career opportunity."
bad,I started working for Target just before the merger with CVS so my experience was tainted by a very disgruntled pharmacy manager who was being removed from her gravy position. Thus the four techs working there and herself were soon to be out of work.
bad,while at target the management changes alot.  Then every week the managers changed how they wanted everything done.  It was extremely stressful.  The job work and life balance didn't work for me.  It seemed like management wanted you there all the time even if it was your day off.  The regular team members get no benefits.  You can't progress up the ladder there.  (management already knows who they want where) Management was terrible.  THere was no communication at all.  Job culture was very stressful
bad,"I'd often work alone for hours on end in the kitchen of the Target Cafe because either the person doing scheduling forgot that the kitchen needs two people to run it or another employee would just fail to show up. Things were often broken and it was very easy to get hurt in that environment. But nothing in that position compares to what it was like being a cashier. "
bad,"Everyone who left either by choice or not, said it was the best thing that happened in their life."
bad,"It was only part time, the hours was never distributed evenly between employees, I loved helping the guests find things in the store, the hardest part of the job was trying to work at a strong pace when other employees didn't."
bad,I collect the cash and give the customers their change back. Sometimes I help directing customer to a certain location where their were looking for a certain product. I sometimes help in the back with the stocking.
bad,manager here young kids playing around not taking job serious unstable schedules you stock in between cashiering it is not a bad job it just is not for me I would work there again if they paid me more money with the experience that I have
bad,"played favorites, if you weren't friends with the boss you worked weekends and holidays. very judgmental. only thing that was great was how customers were treated."
bad,"No advancing, coworkers are your friends/family, but only because there is no work / life balance. They DO NOT care about their workers, put way too much pressure on them without any rewards."
bad,Management has no patience towards customers or team members. Customers are nice and make the job go by faster. A lot of favoritism in the workplace Most enjoyable things about work are the workers and the some of the customers who are understanding.
bad,"unfortunately working as a Hardlines associate at target Palmdale would be considered a dead end job. 5 days a week part time, no benefits, Pay is minimum wage. Expect to work hard with little pay off."
bad,"A political company, based on who you know, not the results you bring.  Mentorship program that they promote, does not work nor is it effective.  Poor morale overall."
bad,The management team needs to pull there heads out of their rear ends to ensure proper business protocols and take care of their employees. Unless you are high in management you do NOT matter.
bad,"while working on the sales floor you are expected to push pulls, backup cashier, backup other departments as needed like electronics, and the backroom too. some of the management were really good people and manage well but other managers have no idea how to run a retail store. market team member was expected to unload the produce dairy and frozen trucks"
bad,"I spent very little time here due to illness, it is hard labor. Standard retail job, heavy labor, poor hours, no benefits and strict management. The A/C was often at reduced power in the summer, leaving the store hot causing complaint from customers and employees."
bad,Executive leadership is not great and the culture is not up to the professional standard that you would hope from a large corporation. Definitely needs improvement
bad,"this is a terrible place to work, if hired you would be kept as a part timer unless you move to a manager position, hourly pay is competitive $10 an hour but definately not enought for the work its done and the way managers would treat you (like a slave), at least in an over night position"
bad,"Target may seem like an open and caring caring company from the outside looking in. However, on the inside you gain a whole new perspective. Target is all about themselves and their upper leaders. Team members are more seen as slaves while people right out of college and no worldly experience are made managers. Target could be a great company if they took a step back to assess what is really going on at the store level."
bad,maintaining a sense or organization and scheduling is super important when you work in softness. management rarely gets on the floor and helps the team members even though it isn't really necessary. if you're not dedicated to constantly being on the floor and giving it your all then this isn't the place for you.
bad,Dont hold your breath for a promotion if you're a Team Leader in the stores.  They like to dangle the promotion in front of you but never intend to reward your hard work with the promotion.  The opening will go to a 22 year old that has never had a job before.
bad,"I did not like my experience with Target in La Plata. The entire store was very unorganized and the management was awful. I do know since I have left the store that the management has changed, so maybe the experience is better with new hires."
bad,I can honestly say i have enjoyed my time here but that is more a result of the people i worked with not the job itself.  The biggest problem with Targets internal structure is they do not try to promote within and if your management ha had a weeks training you would be lucky.  I as a team member have more responsibilities in my day to day shifts then most of those in a management role.  I have learned a lot of skills thru my time their but because i sought out the knowledge they only try to teach what they have to so they can get by.
bad,The managers either work you every day with little hours or work everyday and get 40 hours. If you ask to leave early for family matter or call out or don't agree to stay after every time they ask they cut your hours down to a minimal of 12 hours
bad,I worked as a cashier or on the floor helping guest ringing up merchandise helping locate merchandise stocking shelves packing out boxes doing returns the other workers are nice the company sucks
bad,A typical day at work for me would be an overload of responsiblities unrelated to my job description without getting paid to do so. Ive learned the ways of retail with in a generally popular shopping center. Management shifted every two weeks so I wouldn't know who I'd have from time to time. The general management was consistent but  made themselves naive to the working environment purposfully. The culture of the workplace only attracted a certain group of people but is welcome to anyone. The hardest part of the job was picking up the  slack of another coworker who decided to not do their part. I enjoyed making long term relationships there with a few employees as well as leaving on good terms.
bad,"Okay very unprofessional, underpaid, excessive hours, no overtime, limited management. No clear directions on day to day basis. No room for growth."
bad,General company terrible managers General people that have Clearwater there the pay is no good and they make you to work more than what they paid
bad,Ils n etait pas pret pour s installer a Montreal...j ai apprecier l experience par contre il manquait de professionnalisme envers la clientele.
bad,i learned not every company is about the welfare of its employees this company is great but the location i was occupying was terrible
bad,I worked here for 27 years and was told when I retired I did not work enough hours for a retirement discount. I felt like I was forced out because I did not get enough red cards which U=I did not feel was fair.
bad,It is a terrible company to work for you are over worked under payed. you should choose any there place if possible. management is terrible.
bad,"*fast paced"
bad,"They hire you for full time and only work 10-15 hours a week, that is not a full time schedule. When people ask for more days and say they need more days you just get pushed to the side and looked at like you didn't ask. If they need you to come in they will call at the last minute thinking you will come in like that especially if you live about 30 minutes to an hour away."
bad,"Very Childish behaviors from management and lack of flexibility when handling problems. Use ""fake"" promotions as leverage to entice cooperation and loyalty."
bad,"My duties at target were high pace and time managed. My morning would usually start with unloading the target trucks and processing products into the store inventory. As part of a team, I had to replenish shelves and stock new incoming merchandise throughout the store before store opens at 8:00am. After 8:00am, my duties would focus more on costumer service. I would assist guest with finding merchandise, stock checks and overall making myself available for any questions guest may have."
bad,"it seemed like management would hunt for reasons to fire certain employees, you could never get your job done fast enough, and you couldn't talk to customers for more than 2 minutes without getting in trouble"
bad,"Management is clueless all the time, Pay is horrible.  Better get customers, oh I am sorry TaRget wants us to call them guests.  apply for the red card or they will fire the employee"
bad,wouldn't recommend it. You're treated like you don't matter and don't exist. Very underpaid for a company that's products are so expensive.
bad,this is an okay company they just never understood that sometimes things in our life happen that our out of our control . and they had no heart when it came to deceased family members they never wanted to give days off
bad,"Although at times I became very bored and unhappy with my role at Target,  I learned quite a bit about my self over the 10 yrs of employment. The staff was very childish and immature. The management was unprofessional and unreasonable. I learned that considering your circumstances nothing is hard to accomplish when you have no alternative! Know you worth and work for what you want."
bad,"This company will spread you thin like butter. (personal experience)"
bad,working here while dealing with family issues but it was difficult working with my team members (Together Everyone Achieves More) and I didn't believe these were concepts that put into action in the store.
bad,I would collect carts also work as a cashier in the mornings.
bad,"If you have a degree of any kind, don't work there.  Corporate is looking for young people right out of school. Why? well because the'll get a smart leader at a very low price.  This is not a place where you can think out of the box. It's what corporate says, the store manager will drive that culture as well.  Again this is not a place for a person with any sort of degree. Do yourself a favor and look elswhere."
bad,"I would not recommend working at this particular Target, as they do not particularly care for their employees. They love to ask the most out of their workers, but never look out for them. They hardly ever give room for advancement to anyone other than those that cater specifically to them and they do not care about any of your personal life issues. (such as sickness or qualifying for FMLA.) They will try to remove you as soon as possible without care and they will smile in your face while doing so. They also give you extreme work loads that are known not to be able to be done within a day and expect to even blaming you specifically for it not getting done, when they know you must also take care of customers, back up for register and helping other people in covering other sections (electronics worker lunch breaks, backroom, etc.) None of the managers are ever on the same page, but all will blame you if something isn't done to save their own position. (The customer is the MOST important thing to them. So if you handle them, you may think you've done mainly what you're supposed to do, right? Wrong. If your initial job for the day is not done, you will still be in the wrong. Regardless of how high volume the rate of customers were that day.) They also do not care if a customer goes to the front desk and gives you specific praise. It will not be added to your file unless it's done through the call-in rating that gives the entire store credit or if you receive a red card for them. These are the only two things they honestly care about."
bad,Store management was horrible. Never knew what time I was getting off. Kept reducing and reducing hours.
bad,"Handling merchandise on the sales floor."
bad,"moving boxes, cutting boxes, tracking inventory, stocking inventory."
bad,"Loved working there, learned how to use quite a few bits of equipment, sadly the management took favorites and refused to properly train new team members. As for the flexible schedule, that's a lie, they make schedules for 5 weeks in advance, and there's literally no way of getting out of it, and nine times out of ten they schedule you for short shifts (4-5 hours). I loved interacting with all the guests and such, but to those applying be wary, it sounds nice on the outside, but underneath they play favorites and treat the new team members like the redheaded step child."
bad,"I worked at target two different locations.  Management is a hit and miss.  I didn't like how they promoted teamwork and work hard and it will pay off.  They barely even wanted to pay people above minimum wage even if you had experience.  The benefits were not that great.  i never bothered trying to get them.  Promotion is hard to get and can be very stressful.  They don't appreciate their employees at all."
bad,A good First time job.If you like to be treated like a team or a place to feel like you belong then this is the job for you.
bad,"A typical day at work was not pleasant. I learned that some people do not care for the workers. Management was all for themselves and showed favoritism. If they liked you, you was able to advance."
bad,Was very discouraged by the ambience this work environment provides. The higher you climb in the organization the worse the situation gets with pressure and unrealistic expectations with minimal training.
bad,I worked at Target for six yrs and was very under paid. This would be a good job for a person that doesn't have any responsibilities. Hours go up and down. I couldn't take it anymore!!!! I had 2 move on!!
bad,"It was a very hectic enviornment! Some employees were unprofessional, and it was quite unorganized."
bad,"I worked for Target for six months and tried to transfer to another store. I got told I cannot get into the store due to I asked them to compensate my pay. I lived in Arizona and tried to transfer to one of the Massachusetts stores and 15 cents was a no. "
bad,"I started at the company while going to school and for me being a full time student and working Target was great! Worked around my class schedule and didn't overload me with hours. I finished school and then my hours started decreasing and room for advancement was slim to none. As a GSA, I feel like upper management still looks down on you even if your are doing above and beyond what your position calls for. Because you are at the bottom of the management totum pole, your opinions on what could make the store run smoother are not heard or taken into consideration. Target tries to make you feel like you can have a life outside of the job, but when they only schedule you at certain times of the day, it makes it seem like they want you to sign your life over to them. With Target being a billion dollar company, I feel as if they should pay better. You can't expect people to work their butts off and pay them minimum wage especially on days where you are short of people. Some employees work entirely too hard and too much not to get properly compensated.  With the holiday season right around the corner, it's going to be harder because Target this year will probably open earlier on Thanksgiving night than it did last year which makes employees angry because it cuts into time spent with their families on the holiday. If Target is such a ""family oriented"" corporation, why take time from families?"
bad,"You are thought of there as ""expendable"" and are not given enough hours to pay your bills. I had some problems with a crass co-worker and when I talked to the manager about it, she swept it all under the rug instead of handling the problem."
bad,I was just in a transitional period when I gained employment here.  This job was just another minimum wage job to earn some money.
bad,I was given good hours but the management was awful there was no promotions and they never recognized  hard work 
bad,too demanding for the pay. i didnt learn anything. i enjoyed helping the customers
bad,easy job environment everyone is friendly hardest part of job is just the mean costumers but if you handle the situation in a kind matter no issue 
bad,"Horrible place, they use and abuse you. They cut your hours and give you more work."
bad,A typical day at work is going to work and working with out being able to work and communicate with people of your team because if they see that you are talking you get coached and get a write up.
bad,Unload the trucks then place items on pallets and stock the shelves. I did not learn anything. Management was nice they gave us free sodas. My co-workers worked as a team so we could leave early. The hardest part was unloading the truck. The best part was the free soda and their Christmas party.
bad,"Although the people were nice, there was a complete lack of communication and that made managing the front end very difficult. The hardest days were weekend days because many part-time people worked at the store on weekends, and they didn't seem to do their job as well as the full-time people who were there all week. Training was also completely lacking, and the hierarchy is slightly ridiculous. It seems like there is always someone one step above you who has slightly more authority, and you do not have the right to do certain things. For example, I was a Guest Service Attendant, meaning I was a supervisor, but I was not allowed to tell the cashiers they were doing something wrong - my supervisor - the Guest Service Team Lead could. It just seems that my position was pointless and also made the team lead's job harder because they had to end up doing work that I very well could have been capable of managing, had it not been for the silly rules at Target."
bad,A typical day at Target consist of being told what you did wrong and not being praise for what you was doing to help the company bring in more business. I learned working at Target that I have the ability to be a manager and would be very good at it. The hardest part was trying to please everyone (customers and co-workers(. The most enjoyable part of my experience at Target was getting to meet all the different guest and speaking about life issues on a daily bases.
bad,Target will not pay their associates for the job they do. Several team members were trained all over the store and still made just minimum wage. Managment was only out for the bottom line and would not help in the store unless there was a customer complaint. The co-workers were the best part of the job. They are some amazing people but the company as a whole is not company I would recomend for anybody.
bad,"I've been bullied and pushed around and the managers joke about it. I work hard, but it's never enough. I will never get enough hours to receive health insurance even though I'm full time. I would never recommend anyone work at Target."
bad,"To the management and corporate Please listen to your team members, also management should definitely learn to manage payroll so tasks can be fufilled"
bad,"The management there is not good, they are disrespectful to their employees and have no motivation to help people move up in the company. They do not help their employees succeed, and are very unprofessional."
bad,"Target has become about pleasing every customer even at the expense of their ethics and morals, they will throw their employees to the wayside to ensure a sale."
bad,Whole different company values from when I started and left. Not family  friendly any more. Management is not qualified to run any area of a store . They are pushing older workers out of positions because management is intimidated by them.
bad,"Its a basic retail job not much to say "
bad,Use to be the best place to work. Not anymore.  Expect MORE pay LESS. They will let you know constantly that you are replaceable. Target use to be about family and employees but not anymore. RUN! Don't let the interview fool you. They sugarcoat it .
bad,"Target is rolling out a job consolidation policy to make associates more “customers focused” this means that over the course of two years the jobs of five people became one person’s work load. In addition, changes are happening all the time as policies don’t work and need to be changed. Frequent visits from corporate and district meant that management was on edge often and hours would be spent on a Tuesday visit instead of busy hours on Saturday or Sunday"
bad,"The job itself was fine, however this company does not care for its employees. many times i've been Told I was extending past the end of my shift to cover other peoples missed work."
bad,"There is no full time, every week is random. I had 40hrs one week then 4hrs the next. Its not sustainable for a normal person. Also ny manager did nothing but still in his office all day then break every company rule, then when I called corporate they did nothing."
bad,"Hours are long, breaks are short, and managers expect more and more from you every time. Loading and unloading trucks during the summer is not the best feeling in the world."
bad,"Unrealistic expectations, poor management, not enough training, payroll not at all efficient to run store successfully for customers, cut hours on long time employees."
bad,"They did not really respect the concept of having more than one job or the balance of work and life (ex: school, family, mental health) They were not understanding of availability switches due to school or home."
bad,It was OK at the beginning. But I had to train on a computer and then the Department Manager would be mad about me not knowing something but yet she didn't even take the time to successfully train me.
bad,"Management was insufficient, and job roles were unfairly distributed. There was favoritism, where one person would not have to work much but still be given praise, while others would be expected to do much more."
bad,"I did not feel valued. There were a lot of times where things were very unorganized and we didn't have a team leader for a year, so we were left to figure a lot of stuff out on our own."
bad,Had me stand behind a register allday couldn't stock even the candy next to me it was awful if you just like to stand and wait for customers to come to you then you should be ok but if you like to do things at work this job wouldn't be for you
bad,"This was the worst job I’ve ever had. I felt very unwelcome and under appreciated. The management was a joke. You could tell them days you can’t come in, and be scheduled anyways, which meant you had to find someone to take your shift. Plus, I missed three days of work that I asked for off, and they didn’t write that down, so I was almost fired. It wasn’t even my fault."
bad,This was the third time working for target and the worst experience i've ever had. This location had a figure it out and get it done mantra. Not for me. Very toxic environment a lot of nit picking. Hair trigger and walking on egg shells. Don't mess up. Limited room for errors. Your development is based on you.
bad,"I would say I had an interesting experience working at target. If you are going to work there, I would apply and work in the grocery dept/“hardlines”. "
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend working for the women’s department. The department is always a mess. The team lead, Gail, barely help cleans. Clothes are always on the floor or thrown around and the department waits until the store is nearly closed to clean it. The department along with the rest of the store is very understaffed. People are always quitting because of the heavy workload and low pay."
bad,"In my experience Target is a place where you shop not work. I was there for a little over a year and there wasn't any room for advancement and they don't really respect their employees who have put in their years there. Their goal was to get them out before they had to pay them a pension. (They don't offer that anymore, but some of these employees were grandfathered in.) I worked with some nice people, but we all knew it was just a job not anything worth taking seriously."
bad,When I was hired here I was promised to get 40 hours a week or close to that...that only lasted for about 3 months and now I'm lucky if I get 20 hours a week...this job has been a big inconvenience and has practically ruined my life because I have lost alot by not being able to pay my bills...I only recommend a job here if you are looking for only part time employment
bad,Target used to be a great company to work for but at some point they lost sight of the importance of employee well being. It is very disappointing considering they have a lot of potential as a company.
bad,"I was a cashier and a soft lines employee there at Target. And I would say this job is fairly easy, but it’s the managers and supervisors that make it hard. Very sneaky and grimy. They love to do things behind your back such as write ups and writing LIES in their little emails. The hours sucked at one point they had the nerve to give out less that 10hrs a week to their employees. Overall it was a toxic work environment to me, theirs so much betters jobs out there. I spent almost 3 years there and the change in management is really where they went wrong. This place wasn’t always so bad but my above if you get hired is to definitely have another job because the hours at Target are not stable at all"
bad,"Too much miscommunication from management, no set schedule, good pay but hours were constantly cut. Everyone I worked with was unhappy and hated coming to work. Also, in order to use your employee discount, which is only 10% and only on Target's own brands, you would have to use a Target credit card. If not, it would be 5%, but only with cash or a gift card."
bad,One of the worst places I have ever worked. If you couldn't get people to sign up for red cards you might as well find a new job. They made you pressure people into signing up for the Red Card.
bad,"Target has changed drastically since I last worked here in 2016.  I left for another job with better hours, a set schedule and higher pay with less stress.  But the people here at my Target store are almost like family, and I missed that camaraderie, so I returned in August of '19.  I count it as one of the biggest mistakes of my life.  "
bad,Hours were not usually consistent and the pay wasn't worth the hours worked. Co-workers were nice and training was more helpful that I thought it would be.
bad,The first three months was it pretty easy but after a while the managers when get very  micromanaging  and hard to communicate with. It became very difficult to work there and Uncomfortable.  They would get  aggressive if you were unable to finish work and rude.
bad,It was only for about a month or so. It was said that you would have to work your hardest to be picked to stay. Management had favorites right off the bat.
bad,I was there for a month and started out okay. What they don’t realize is that you can hire a lot of people but if the job culture and staff morale is low.  then how will there be a good outcome. HORRIBLE place to work at. Management are rude and not all that great. Do your best to have a second job because this place will be quick to let you go.
bad,"Taken advantage of not enough hours. No hours no benefits working 4 hrs. A week.showing favoritism towards friends, who get 20hrs or more a week. Never answer the phone or door to employees. If you complain they retaliate by giving you less hrs. Or don't let you stay. They yell at you or threaten you. Sexually harrased. Won't do anything about it. Depends on who it is."
bad,they hype you up in the beginning and make you excited to work there but it slowly becomes the most depressing place on earth. i would rather be unemployed than go back there. my advice is to never do full time. they will work you until you physically cant. they expect you to do 12 peoples job AND your own all in an 8 hr shift. the leaders pretend to care and pretend to work hard when corporate is watching but they are usually only on the floor for about an hour every day. youre on your own out there in a jungle of customers. just dont do it. work at arby's.
bad,"The management is disorganized, the training is poor especially in the starbucks area, theres no regard for the well being of workers, starbucks is stressful and you cant take tips, as well as closing alone and lots of understaffing"
bad,Fun to work there with very nice people but the mangers were awful all they cared about was numbers not how well the job was being done and got mad how much time a job took when they have never done the job
bad,I have not stepped foot back into my local target since I left in 2014. The management was terrible and rude. Unrealistic expectations and always left work feeling like I wasted my time because we were set up for failure.
bad,They have such a high turnover rate because of the stress and just unrealistic expectations. They expect you to do 3-4 peoples jobs. They try to come off as laid back but that couldn't be any less true. It's great as a short teen job but that's about it.
bad,"Ok if you are currently in need of a part time job and the culture differs store, to store. Management can be entitled and want your life to revolve 24/7 around the store."
bad,You'll definitely learn a lot. There isn't a shortage of work to do or people to help. You'll be pushed to your limits and you'll constantly find new ones.
bad,"No regards for safety"
bad,"Working for Target was meh. I was there seasonally for christmas. To be honest, it didn't leave a lasting memory or anything. The uniforms were also ugly."
bad,"yearly reviews along with a cheap raise meant nothing, because after those happened the base pay went equal for everyone. So new comers and people that I had to train made the same as me even though I was there 2 years. High/unrealistic expectations. Added job responsibility with no pay. Poor communication between management and team. Questions or concerns? Forget it they don’t care."
bad,I worked there from 2014 to 2018 and it was all about having favorites and not being an excellent hard working employee. No benefits and racism and other issues
bad,"A typical day working at Target in Commack South was practically doing everything on your own with limited instruction and Team Leads no where to be found. Excecutive Team Leads were just as flaky, no response when called for assistance, no clear instruction to keeping the floor in check. I would consistently see higher up laughing and joking around taking laps around the retail floor to get away from doing anywork."
bad,"Worked there over a year, it’s always stressful. Everyone sucks at communicating. The ‘guests’ complain all the time for the dumbest things. The environment is real toxic. The pay raise you get is always less than 50 cents unless you’re an A player which means you gotta kiss some butt. Definitely do not recommend working here."
bad,"The work is easy, repetitive and boring but simple to do.  The rudeness of the guests is amazing. The filthy things that people do in the store can change your entire view of humanity.  The craziest are the people who look down on the employees that they need to help them. Helping the nice people is wonderful but the others are just terrible. The worst are the guests who are physically abusive, they bump you, rub you, hit you with their shopping carts."
bad,In the location I was placed in there was not a lot of traffic so sales were poor. There isn’t a lot of coverage when it comes to the store. Numerous times where they ask you to cover for other stores
bad,"I only worked at target for about 6 months, that was all I could handle. The management was terrible. They were all children and acted like it. I constantly heard managers talking poorly about other employees in front of us. They have certain lunch hours you have to follow, and if you don’t you will get written up, yet they give you certain tasks that MUST be done before break, or you get written up. They go through people so quickly you never work with the same people on a day to day basis because they always have people quitting and walking out on them because of how much they use they’re employees. We get overloaded with work and don’t get compensated for the amount of work we do. You can only be a full-time employee if you are a manager. Over all, working at Target was the worst work experience I’ve ever had and I would not wish for my worst enemy to be employed there. The only thing that got me through those few months was some of the people working there but they all quit before I did."
bad,Every week i would ask to be made full time.  every week i was fed the same story about them looking into it.  i was worked so my hours came in at 31 1/2.  i needed an average of 32 to get insurance.  they purposefully keep your hours low so they dont have to give you insurance or PTO
bad,"After being an employee for 10 you thing you would have seen it all right? Wrong. Year after year I constantly see the management and team leaders get worse in not doing their jobs, and well as company policy get change so much to the point where no one knows what it is or the knowledge they did know no longer applies."
bad,"I learned a lot about people, and how to adapt to the many kinds of people in the world. Out of all the jobs iv'e had, this was definitely the worst. Very unhealthy work environment a lot of young people, and terrible management."
bad,"I always felt that the management was never aware of what was really going on in the store because they're always so busy with other behind the scenes things. however while the job itself is fine, I found my training to be extremely underdone and I was left unprepared for the actual job itself, leading to many issues as you could guess. if you are ever caught without a smile on your face you will get called out on it, and management likes to say ""it keeps you on your toes"", so a sense of job security feels like a joke. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rushes, customers are often cranky when they have to wait and will take it out on you, my biggest piece of advice is during the interview if you apply for a sales floor position, they will ask you if you are flexible to cashier, SAY NO. if you say you will you will lose the sales floor position and you will get hired as a cashier only."
bad,Target used to be a great place to work that valued family work balance but they have changed their entire business plan and do not care about the employees anymore
bad,Worst management ever. They don’t ever train anyone and have me do it when I have a lot to do at service desk and for pick ups and drive ups all day. Keep hiring more people when there’s 0 hours. Makes 0 sense. People in charge have no clue what they’re doing. All are idiots.
bad,"It's ok for a second job that you may not really need, i.e. seasonal. I would NOT make Target your primary job unless you are passionate about retail work and want to stay there and move up. Otherwise there are no guarantees and the company doesn't care about the employees."
bad,Target claims that everyone works together as a team but different departments are always in disagreeance. They are also doing away with management positions.
bad,"My coworkers are the best, but the hours are scheduled horribly and not applicable for a Starbucks location. It's a stressful work environment daily and coworkers have to left alone multiple times because of the scheduling issue, which makes it really difficult to enjoy working there."
bad,"Management rides you to get your job done on time, but doesn't provide much assistance, or if they do it's only temporary. "
bad,"I hate working at target! The management is awful & they do know how to treat or talk to people. Unless you are a manager don't apply for a position here. You will be under paid for the work you do, making $12.00 per hr working here."
bad,"Worst. Place. Ever. Started out nice then they wanted me to work days I couldn't. No one cared about their job. Management had their heads held so high they would probably drown if it rained. Employee discounts seemed like a joke. "
bad,"Every night was the same a lot of work and not enough people. Management was inconsistent with their directions. Store manager and district manager were never in the same page with headquarters. The culture is very cut throat and every body has a hidden agenda. At Target is not what you know or how good of an employee you are, its more of who you know and who likes you. Hardest part of the job is seeing and hearing how upper management insults your team members on a daily basis. Most enjoyable part is working side by side with a team who works over night and picks up the slack of the day side team."
bad,"Very poor management. Management often treats you as though you are a child. There is a MAJOR communication issue within the store. You would expect a major retailer to have set goals and policies in place but no. Policies and rules often change from manager to manager, shift to shift. The turn over at this location is extremely high due to all the issues with management.  They often get scheduling wrong and will change your schedule after it's been posted without warning. They will literally harass you to death about signing guest up for red cards. Management will gossip about other employees, it's an adult high school, extremely unprofessional."
bad,"Some leads are great. They care, and still do what they can to help us grunts get the work done. Others don't, and that just drags the rest of us down. Everyone else gets to feel the strain when there isn't any room in the back, or vehicles to put back stock onto. "
bad,"Target was my first job. I was really excited. That quickly changed. I got barley two shifts worth of training then thrown onto a register by myself, then would get bad marks on my review for going slowly. They have this stupid rule where if you are under 18, all you can do is cashiering. That's it. no cross training available or expansion. You're stuck on the register. While I worked there I was definitely treated differently by the shift leads. They felt that I was useless because I was not able to cross-train and that was ultimately the reason they let me go, because they felt I had no use to them because I was not 18. They also put WAY too much stock on the Red Card. it's a 5% discount off of your purchase. it's really hard to sell that super low discount to people. your employment with them practically depends on how many red cards you get. they make you feel like you failed if you didn't meet your quota for the week. it is overall a terrible place to be a cashier at."
bad,Would not recommend this job if you plan on staying long due to poor management and inconsistent hours. Very difficult to change you availability if able to change it at all.
bad,"Typical day at target consists of making through everything the store throws at you. I learned how to handle irate customers and handle being put in various situations throughout the day. It never felt like the management actually cared to help or understand your current situation. The workplace culture is very bleak, everyone is just trying to make it through the day. The hardest part of the job was holiday's/black friday."
bad,"It was my first time working late night hours. I started working there, before the store was open to the public. The work was very hard and stressful, and management did not know what was going on for most of the time."
bad,"The turn over rate is very high. The new executive team leader in Gig Harbor has done such a terrible job that no less than 12 people have left in the last 8 months and I personally know of 5 more waiting for acceptance letters from other jobs. It is very sad that the higher ups back such a terrible boss. I would have (and planned to) stay with Target until I retired but she made that impossible. They told me i would get a promotion and i worked insanely hard during 4th quarter but after 4th ended and they had me doing all the team lead work for none of the pay, they told me they would start training me. I had already been training for 6 months and they basically reset me after reaping the full benefits of my hard labor. It was heart breaking and a waste of half a year. They simply do not care."
bad,"I've worked at Target for over a year.  The management is unorganized and biased. The favoritism is real and blatantly obvious.  Those who turnup with management gets the hours and decent paychecks. Those who don't... good luck with the scraps. Target does not offer real full time or part time roles unless in management.  There are adults working there, why would they not offer 40 hours and benefits when you're a multi million (if not billion) dollar company?"
bad,"You will work extra hard during holidays season. They don’t promote often. You’ll be overwhelmed, overworked and underpaid. They don’t care if you’re sick you still have to work."
bad,Work was frantic and unorganized. Team Leads and Leaders wouldn't know what they wanted you to do. there was no leadership and all the responsibility fell on the coworkers.
bad,Had three different managers in the span of three weeks; each manager had expected the previous manager to complete training and changed rules from one person to the next.  Training was inconsistent and incomplete - No consistency between upper management and area managers; no regular assigned hours.
bad,"There are worse places to work but it's nearly impossible to get full time hours or a raise above the company minimum. However, the work is not hard so if you need a part time job it's not bad."
bad,I did not like working here. the managers did not keep their word about me staying full time . i do not recommend anyone to work here. i did not have a good experience . the hours were bad .
bad,"Just your typical snob job. They preach acceptance and open mindedness but they pick their favorites, skrew you on hours, and their biggest compensation at work is snacks"
bad,Worked here for 3 years and they play favorites harder then any other place I’ve worked for.  In all honesty I wish I didn’t quit my good paying job for target.
bad,"My location has a poor work environment. The STL does not encourage team members to grow. All team"
bad,The manager didn’t schedule enough co workers for my shifts. The Management was very unprofessional. They push there store credit cards on customers. Co workers that would work would have conversations with each other insureds of helping guests.
bad,"The lead talked to me like I'm stupid. Our department lead was always talking to other employees, though he was supposed to help us. The company would rather us push ALL product onto the sales floor, then to go through properly to discard anything out of date."
bad,Ive been apart of target since 2016 it was good but since new management arrived 1 year ago its been stressful. The work isn't difficult but the way management is at this point of time i recommend you try target as a last resort. The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing some of the coworkers. The hardest part of the day is really management work ethics and communication hasnt been up to par lately.
bad,"my management was horrible. Target talks about diversity but I don't actually see it in person. All of our management are white. As a person of color, and my managers being white they did not understand me. I would get yelled at if I was talking to a co worker, who was also a person of color, but my managers would sit there and gossip to each other for 30 minutes. They also had very poor communication skills."
bad,"Close to home.  Easy to transfer to other stores."
bad,"I don't have any qualms about the TARGET corporation, but the store I worked for specifically was the absolute worst store I have ever seen. Management was poor, there was a lack of leadership and communication between the management and the team members, work hours were never guaranteed, and the whole work environment is stressful and lowers team morale. It felt like no one cared about you, the HR department didn't care about if we were not feeling well or getting hurt on the job, supervisors would threaten that you are ""easily replaceable"" but then struggle to provide enough labor for a full work day. Management would make up rules that did not comply with the Target Handbook and would often put blame on team members instead of looking to resolve any issues. I have worked for other stores before, and there are Target stores that love their workers."
bad,"As a Target Team member, the managment at the store i was lacked repect for the hourly worker.  They cut hours and staff while the work load increased.  The store wanted you to me available for all shift and hours.  It was diffcult on home life especially at Holiday time.  Advancement would have been an option for me, however, the benefits did not out weigh the work."
bad,"The work day is stressful because management expects more from you than you are capable of doing on your own during your shift. There is no ""team"", no one lends a hand when you need it. Don't ever expect recognition because such thing does not exist. There are no benefits for part time workers and the only full time positions are for team leads and management."
bad,Its all about favoritism. Managment sucked. Schedule was never right. Everyone basically makes the same doing different jobs no matter how hard they work. Little to no advancement. Doesnt matter how many times you tell managment something isnt working. Cheap cheap cheap. Crazy about dress code and dumb rules. Dont do it
bad,Would make you work 39.5 hours so you didn’t qualify as a full time employee and get benefits. Horrible shift manager would have you work an 8 hour shift till close at around 12 and have you open the next day at around 8. If you left at 12 and fell asleep at 12:20 and woke up at 7:00 to be able to get ready and get to work on time you would have only 7 hours to sleep but for people who had to commute an hour both ways this was horrible and poor management because it impacted work.
bad,"Pay is minimal, management is awful, corporate does not listen to complaints. Expectations are too high for the amount of compensation offered to leadership."
bad,"Target does not foster a positive culture. There is no work life balance, system of accountability, and advancement is very difficult as the system is working towards a youth movement"
bad,worked for this company many years really enjoyed it until all of a sudden they decided they didn't want people that had been there for a long time many people who helped open the store that i was working at if they were in a supervisor position found them selves being fired under false reason that were made up by management
bad,"The management as this target is not only extremely poor, they are also very rude and uncaring. They don't do their jobs well at all or seem to care for the well being on their employees"
bad,Working at Target is not easy and prepare too work hard.The hours are very low and alot of workers who quits because there are no hours. There are also alot of employee turnovers. Target only cares for management and prefers have more managers and employees who does the work.
bad,Your experience will depend on the store you work at. Some locations simply have better management and people who care. The drama is a bit much and unnecessary.
bad,"cut throat, back stabbing people. please stay away especially at holiday times. the make you work the worst shifts even though your disabled. they don't care about you as a person"
bad,"You had to ask every guest if they wanted a red card.  That was annoying.  Cons were no benefits, you had to pretend to work if there were no guests there.  They would mess up your schedule without you knowing about it.  Pros were you would get a free lunch every once in a while if you had 10 consecutive red cards signed up."
bad,If you are good in with store manager you will get a raise and or promotion. Don’t disagree with management or else they will try to fire you. The pay was horrible for the work that you do
bad,target is in it for themselves. they dont care for their employees or their career advancement. they will find any way they can to fire you so they can hire someone younger at a cheaper rate.
bad,"The pay is terrible. There is no room for advancement unless you marry the corporate rhetoric and are willing to work constantly. Pay for management may be ok, but perspective to what they expect at that level it is ridiculous."
bad,"It wasn't bad place to work far as pay with it being hard to find employment but the management allowed certin people to get extra hours. when ask for more hours or different job training the manager in hirer position actually laughed in my face , the store owner was very rude and would rush you off the clock. I was being scheduled sometimes 10 hours a week and maybe off a week but lowest check was 38.00 that made me fall behind in rent and get an eviction. Also when you would call corporate to complain they would inform store lead who would later threatening employees continue to be dirty just because. I have also seen people come to work and be ask to leave becuase they already had enough people scheduled"
bad,"Target doesn't support the minority employees. Management is extremely cut throat and dishonest. Management promotes an ""open door"" policy but closes the door when you attempt to open the door and have open communication."
bad,"Average day here was often completing tasks the manager didn't complete and catching-up with work details because of poor task structure. Department manager was rarely present. Co-workers, other departments, and mangers are very disrespectful."
bad,"Honestly, as someone who identifies as transgender, I had my coworkers as supportive individuals, however, the management directly above me was obviously very hateful and uncomfortable in my choice of gender."
bad,"I usually spend  three hours every Friday, Saturday and Sunday cashiering and  serving cafe food.  This is a very bad place to work.  I was called ""Sweetie"" and ""homophobic"".  It is cutthroat and you cannot disagree with a manager as you will be put on the ""black list"".  The work rules you have to follow change daily and there is not enough time in the world to do what they tell you has  to be done in a certain time."
bad,"The management at the Biddeford target is so poor, they don't care how they speak to employees and the HR makes excuses for unprofessionalism and rudeness. They don't give you the hours they tell you they'll give you, and when confronted they let you go as to cover their own backs. only up side is that most of the lower level employees are super nice and great to work with."
bad,"It’s a cool place, but it is not really worth it. As for cashiers we don’t get enough credit for what we do, pay is good it is lowkey stressful and customers are rude half of the time and try to finesse you with coupons and cartwheel deals. If you want a good part time target is ok. Management truly don’t care about you, just sales."
bad,this particular store had very poor management the hours varied every week ...some weeks i would only work 3 hours a day and my checks was extremely low ..other weeks they would keep me on a full 8 hours and my check would be very formidable
bad,The only good thing about Target is that the pay is relatively good. Raises once a year if your performance is good. The team leads can be unrealistic about job expectations and tend to be rude. The atmosphere at Target is just no good.
bad,"Back room is always an extreme mess, you cannot maneuver anything at all. Any time I ask for help with things like team lifts I get denied, resulting in many injuries that I still have to work with. There is nobody in the back room after 5pm except from ship from store. My team lead never does anything when it comes to communication to the team. Whenever I say anything I get yelled at. Its toxic. I cannot stand it. There isnt enough members to do anything."
bad,The turnover rate for management was so high and the management style was so inconsistent from one year to the next it was  difficult to follow. The work environment was almost always toxic and most employees did not enjoy working there.
bad,"with different management comes changes. I've spent almost half my life working for this company.After spending the past year and a half dealing with deaths in my family and personal issues I was fired unjustly. I enjoyed most of my time there, but I had no idea that I would receive the treatment I did. I was always on time, had multiple promotions throughout my career. After almost 13 years I was terminated.Many of the managers are unfair."
bad,"Ran multiple different departments at store level, each day upon arrival you would observe what needed to be done and came up with a game plan.  Work within department guidelines to ensure departments ran cleanly.  Be willing to change plans on short notice due to call ins, increase customer traffic or upper management visits."
bad,"my first ""real"" job was Target as a cashier. I absolutely could not stand working there. This was many years ago, so maybe things have changed. It was ridiculously bad"
bad,They didn’t have there workers back. They over worked just and only complained about how much we didn’t get done. Never seeing home much we didn’t. I would never work at target again.
bad,"Managers have bad attitudes, customers feel very entitled and are rude.  Whenever there was a problem with the customer, the managers would ALWAYS take their side even if i was right."
bad,Everyday was stressful. The manager over us would talk down to everyone in our group. Not understanding at all about family problems/issues. I did meet some great people there and I now have some fantastic friends.
bad,"I have worked at Target for over half a decade, I am now making the same hourly wage someone who starts today would. As there have been cutbacks in all departments I am now expected to perform the duties of multiple other work centers on top of my own existing work. Multiple managers provide conflicting instructions and unrealistic expectations and there is no concern for the individual on the management's part so long as the work is done."
bad,"After months of training, in multiple stores, the actual work was different.  Those with whom I worked with, were not helpful at all.  I felt lost and management could have  cared less."
bad,"Unorganized with a lack for forward thinking or constant direction from management. Its become a very, ""do more with less"" environment, and that includes how much they pay you."
bad,"The job was challenging enough, the coworkers were the only redeeming factor and then the management didn't want us interacting with each other. Terrible management, shady business practices."
bad,Honestly loved working at target for the first couple of months. Up until recently i started hating working there. The supervisors are extremely rude and if you try to stick up for yourself they try to push you out the door
bad,"Shift started at 5pm and they wouldn't let me out until 4 or 5am with only one 15min break.  no communication, treated employees horrible, extremely fast turnover for that store .  Was so thrilled that I was able to get out of there and into a different company."
bad,This is not a place I would recommend to anyone. They have a high turn over rate and if you get hurt on the job you can be sure to get fired a few weeks after.
bad,"I worked at Target for two years. I first started off working freight for a year, so I would start work at 4 in the morning. For the longest time, I didn't really have a set schedule. I didn't know if I was going to be working 8 hours or 2 because they kicked people out a lot of the times (mainly the truck team) because they couldn't manage the hours they were giving out to employees. "
bad,Target is a really rough place to work to be honest. It comes down to working way harder than any other retail store for the same amount of pay just because. During my time there i was being asked to do so much in such a small amount of time I found it to be near impossible to satisfy management. Its a work place that i would not recommend over say Walmart or another retail store that for lack of a better explanation understands that it is a retail store and shouldn't be taken so seriously. And normally I wouldn't complain about working hard but when the pay is the same if not worse than other retail stores it just is not worth it.
bad,"Management was poor at their jobs and made me dread coming in to work. I felt like they were always watching my every move. I know two people from other target stores that also hated working there an eventually left. A pretty decent group at the target I worked at did not enjoy work. Management tried to keep things efficient but set unattainable goals. People were always worried they couldn't reach their goals everyday and felt helpless even though these people had great work ethic. I wish the target corporation would change and give management new techniques instead of letting them bully their employees. Im happy I left and would not recommend you work here. I don't believe all the target stores are like this but from what I hear, there seems to be similar problems at multiple stores. This is my opinion and experience from working there so take what you will from this. I know a few people who actually enjoy working at target so there are mixed feelings."
bad,There job is easy but you dont get to move up there tell you have been there a long time. They will train you on many things in the store and the work can be fun with the other team members.
bad,worked as a cashier and sometime would get pulled to other departments to as flexible fulfilment. was constantly told id be trained but months have passed and it hasn't happened.
bad,"Overall management didn’t know what to do, and couldn’t communicate to each other as to what their employees were supposed to be doing. Along with harassment it wasn’t worth the money."
bad,"I worked over night at Downtown Target and there was a huge double standard in the work place, but in a very unusual way. The hard workers who had a WAY bigger work load than others would get yelled at called names and were given no help when needed. Well the slower workers who dragged their feet all night were given so much help most of the time they'll leave early while the rest of us were neck high with work still to be done."
bad,it was what it was.  just another retail job until i found more of real job.  pretty much what you think it is like.  watch superstore for an idea....
bad,The particular store I’m employed at is horrible! The GSA’s don’t care to do their jobs. The ETLs aren’t on the same page. The hours are terrible! They ask for you availablity and schedule you anything anyway. They also over hire
bad,As a fresh out of high school needing a summer job Target fulfilled their role but it was never meant to be where I worked forever just needed to move on.
bad,"They had rats running around in the back room"
bad,I am well aware not all targets are the same. but the target i worked at was managed by very unprofessional personal. therefore it all depends on which target you work at. i recommend super targets. store is bigger and they take their job more serious and are more professional.
bad,"At the store I had the management was pretty bad and they obviously had favorite workers that they would turn a blind eye on the bad behavior. I had to call in due to car issues once and was reprimanded the next day for not calling a taxi to have a ride when I would have spent more on a taxi than my shift would have paid me that day. Managers would ignore you unless they had something to say, not a very friendly environment as they try to make it seem. If you can't sell a red card you'd get in trouble, cashiers were constantly quitting because of the treatment."
bad,people were ok I was forced to do maintenance work and my stomach couldn't keep up it was my first real job it got me a little learning experience and to get my foot in the door
bad,"Poor management, no overtime (but I was only part time). Over worked, underpaid. But working retail during the holidays is pretty rough no matter where you work."
bad,"I has been good to get on my feet but, I am very ready to move on. If you need a first job or a ""get back on my feet"" job, then yes this is the place to go."
bad,I learned to keep to my self at that job. I was written up for small stuff and didn't feel like I could advance in that job. They weren't flexible with hours and people schedules.
bad,"I ended up doing the jobs of multiple people for five years. The management is horrible. I was doing a manager's job at the very end with no title and no recognition. Raises suck. New people coming in were making like only cents less than I was making and I had been there for five years. You are only recognized if you are a suck up. On top of the terrible management and clique-like co-workers, you have to deal with customers. Which can be annoying, but it's the job. I would only recommend working here if you are in high school or you just need some extra money. It took me four and a half years to finally reach ""full-time"" and be able to sign up for minimum benefits. They will hold you just under full-time just so they can't give you benefits. Target would be a better place to work if the management would stop being stupid."
bad,"It sucked a lot, like I'm not even kidding about how bad it sucked. I put it was cut-throat because it made me want to cut MY throat. They literally drove me to insanity, I'm on 38 different pills now."
bad,"I'm sure everyone who's worked a retail job before knows how Target works as a company. The general public is terrible, but office politics in retail is usually worse than the clientele."
bad,This company is a good company for students lookinig for employment.  They quote you a salary and hours and go back on their word once you're hired.  The company promotes long term employees into positions that they don't have any experience in and make them managers.
bad,Poor management as many were fresh out of college with art degrees and knew nothing about retail. Gossip central. No one trained anyone you learned from being disciplined.
bad,"When I first started with this company, some 15+ years ago. It was a great place to work at. At that time the Manager and some of the Execs, they genuinely cared about the employees. I did learn a lot from some of them, especially our manager at that time. He was the type of manager, that wasn't afraid of getting his hands dirty. The hardest part of the job for me, was saying good bye to him, the day that he retired. The most enjoyable part of this job, was the day I started working in the Office."
bad,they didnt give you enough time to get your job done and they were always pushing you to hurry up when you were going as fast as you could with what you had to do. they are always trying to get the employees to do more than they are able to get done . if you said anything about what you didnt like they would cut your hours to where you didnt work but a couple days a week.
bad,"If you plan to work at Target for any long term period, just know the company thinks you are a dime a dozen. Target only really worries about their management, sending them on bowling trips or to Disneyland so they can ""bond."" Target doesn't care about it's regular team members though. Can't stand your position and want to try working in a different area? Fat chance if management thinks you're good at what you're doing. Want to transfer stores? They won't let you if it'll ""hurt the company in any way."" So you're either stuck in a position that makes you miserable, or you're forced to find employment elsewhere. All in all, I would never recommend working at Target."
bad,"Not a good place to work at all. Company is cheap, treats their workers like cattle and no respect at all for the people who help make the company what it is today. I can say I was ashamed to have been employed by Target and I have zero interest in working for them ever again. I was fired for coming down with pneumonia. That says it all."
bad,play alot of favoritism. has the enviornment to sustain sexist and racist appetites. feels good for 3 months and then you start to see the true colors at 6 months.
bad,I noticed at target that management doesn't really listen to you as a cashier. Hardest part of the job was meeting managements expectations with signing people up for target cards.
bad,It was a ok worker at target but it's not for me. The work is fast past and it was not the bad part. It was the scheduling it was very confusing and that not good for a worker not understanding as a new employee
bad,"In both roles I have had at Target the on boarding process was virtually non-existant.  Management is clueless at understanding what their employees job's entail and everyone is doing much more work than necessary.  Softwares are archaic; Target always seems to be a step behind in terms of beneficial softwares, both to advance workplace achievements as well as retain a presence in the ever struggling retail industry."
bad,"Work day was routine and most cases low productivity due to system issues. I learned that retail business is very competitive and requires change constantly but it doesn't come easy  and getting a head in the industry is very gradual. Due to high rate of employees turnovers getting a promoted is more seniority based than work ethics and dependability. Of course workplace culture is non existence because of the high employee turnover."
bad,"not good management will be quick to let you go if you are not one of the favorites "
bad,morning started by filling in automatic refills. then we would start on the emailed or faxed prescriptions and fill those. took inventory and ordered any meds we were running low on.
bad,"pays ok to start, but they say they promote from within and continue to hire outside for team lead needs. almost everyone at my store has expressed the want to move up in the company and their passion is not nurtured and grown the same way other companies would help you move forward."
bad,"working at the target in skyline was interesting. their management can be somewhat flaky, if they have a direct issue they will not come to you but instead go to your superior. they don't have control over their actual target employees which makes it a bit overwhelming when they approach third party employees."
bad,"Worked for a boss who was straight out if college with no idea what he was doing, as a result I completed my work and his and ended up burning myself out. There is little room for advancement as corporate likes to bring in new college graduates at a lower salary."
bad,In target the management treat a lot of employees unfairly. They don't give opportunity to advance in the work environment. The managers talk about the employees to other employees.
bad,"As a newly employed operator at Target Brea, you face many challenges the minute you clock in. You never know what your area will look like upon arrival. The operators that have been employed there for at least a year or more receive little to no repercussions for leaving an absolute mess for the relieving operator. Favoritism plays a large roll in the operation of this stores location."
bad,I worked at target in San Antonio when i started college. They refused to work around my school schedule even though that was the only reason I took the job to begin with. The last straw was when I got sick and threw up on shift and my manager refused to let me leave because the next cashier didn't come on shift until 1 pm.
bad,easy going until you get on the line..lifting heavy objects and scanning boxes and putting them out on the aisle.. overnight shift which made it easier to take care of business in the day
bad,GSA's (front end supervisor) are severely underpaid even though they are expected to take care of LOD duties when LOD's are too lazy or forgetful to leave their office and do their job when their help is needed. LODs are paid double what a GSA is paid without having to deal with customers and issues at the capacity a GSA's has to. NOT WORTH IT!
bad,"Working at Target teaches you very useful skills. A typical day consists of performing tasks in various roles, usually ending with a general cleaning of the store. Overall, if you work as an electronics salesman, your time is spent engaging with customers and keeping the back of the store looking presentable."
bad,Retail was not for me.  I loved how active and fast paced it was but was looking for more opportunities to advance.  I was hired as a seasonal associate but really needed a full-time position.  I was called in on almost every scheduled day off.
bad,Fun job but to slow for me I like fast pasting jobs. & target was just not the right job for me.But it was easy to learn and catch on to the cash registers
bad,Bi monthly tests were administered for speed and the amount of credit cards you were able to open during that time frame.  Each employee was rated on these scales.  The position was a checkout clerk and I found the expectations to be unexpedetdly demanding for the financial compensation even though I excelled at the position.  I worked there for only a short time.
bad,You get hired on as one thing and never end up doing the job you were hired to do. Always seem to be cleaning up others peoples messes.
bad,"It's not the best job in the world but, it's a good way to for those who need a job for the first time.  You meet good coworkers and not some good coworkers,"
bad,"They were rude, did not respect my pronouns, or my disability. I struggled at this job for a months before finally quitting."
bad,There was no such thing as a doctor's note from what I've witnessed. Team members get injured and tried to push them along or make them quit. management made their own rules and showed favouritism.
bad,The managers don't care about their team members and don't treat all of them equally. I have worked here for two years as a food worker and they expect me to be able to do five hours of work in a hour.
bad,"no benefits,bad hours,Bad pay. The only raise you will ever get is about 5cents in a year..tops 10 cents. Tjis is one of the worst companys to work for."
bad,"This isn't a review of Target- It's for Target Mobile, a separate company that works along Target to sell Wireless phones/accessories. Market source is a horrible company, no increase of rates of pay. Recruiters lie to you about the commission, which by the way, is horrible. You're lucky if you actually get $20 commission check every other week. Target's employees are more of a pain in the butt than an actual help to you. They want you to do all their work and do yours on top of theirs."
bad,"I loved it when I worked on the floor, but when our store manager went for a promotion, he made our work life horrible. I took a promotion to be a front end manager and it was honestly one of the worst decisions I've made. The REDcard focus and how horrible they are to cashiers who struggle with them is ridiculous. I left because I could not do it. I could not be part of the monster."
bad,Get the hrs while you can you get the most hrs during the holiday season as soon as jan 2nd comes the cut hrs a lot some people are friendly but be carful who you befriend just be fast and productive
bad,"I began to work at Target during school and required that they acknowledge my school schedule. They did not, causing me to miss classes."
bad,Management does not like to work with employees when life happens. They tend to expect more from their employees but do not offer the correct compensation for such responsibilities.
bad,"Hard to be accepted and appreciated for advancement if you are not a college graduate. Favoritism is obvious. When new good positions become available, family members of current managers are given first priority."
bad,Management was never consistent. Turnover rate was higher than any job I have ever had. Changed Store Managers three times in one year at one point.
bad,"Typical days at work start with a superficial ""huddle"" that really has no pertinence. ...that's if you're opening. If you didn't open, you usually have no idea what is supposed to be going on throughout the day. There is NO and I do repeat NO COMMUNICATION between the upper management and the employees!"
bad,Very low pay for most positions. No advancement opportunities. Part time work only. Weekend and holiday work mandatory. Training unorganized.
bad,"If your looking for a job where a lot is expected out of you then this is a good place to work for. "
bad,It's a great place to start and learn how to multi-task and manage. However I don't recommend making it your life long career.
bad,If you do not like having any kind of social life this is a job for you. You have to be awake at 230 am to work a 4 am shift and then you are told that schedules arent in affect expect to stay longer than your schedule states. How are you suppose to schedule anything around that.
bad,"Target started off as a great job for me, learning new things and also meeting new people. But as time went on, the managers and supervisors would allow you to even associate with other employees on the job. I got fired from working there and I was a great worker. Never missed a day and I completed my duties. The manager couldn't even help me keep my job there and here me out. She fired me and another pregnant employee for no reason."
bad,"Im a hardworking individual so all I did was work work work, and you get recognised for that. Like managers would come to me and tell me what a good job Ive done in my area but the pay is not great. I was actually promoted but was bad timing, I had to take a leave. $8 an hour and a promotion is 0.25 more, and Target is a decemt company compared to others that pay way better."
bad,"I loved working with my staff, I was over 16 Target employees. My manager was never in the store during my working hours besides holidays. Too many demands placed on me while other did not help meaning peers and upper management."
bad,Depending on your department if can be a okay place to work if you enjoy the retail environment. Cashiers have to massively push the credit cards and have people to sign up for a credit card. If you work on the floor then it can be a little more relaxed.
bad,"It was a normal warehouse atmosphere , loud from the machines and trucks pulling up and driving off, I started off temporary from a employment agency and then i began to work directly for the company.I learned how to expedite freight and a small amount of Spanish."
bad,not the best place to work. they don't care about their employees. they care even less for their customers. they don't care if you get your break or not.
bad,"Starting out there, it seemed like a good place to work. Management was nice at first, they seemed very helpful but get past the first month or so and if you're doing a good job or what some team members told me, too good of a job and they'll basically trap you. They'll do everything within their power to make sure you don't advance in the store, by making you pretty much miserable to the point that they can say your attitude is poor. They work you to the grindstone so hard that even when regular floor team members come up to help us at the registers when the store gets super busy (we're always understaffed up front) they tell us how glad they aren't us. Working here is just a place for me to gain work skills and experience, I doubt it is a place where anyone can move from the ground and work their way up, that's why there's a glass ceiling and they move management around so much so that if you do get close to someone, they're gone soon enough."
bad,The only thing that keeped me there this long was the guests and interacting with the people everyday made the job bareable. I hated the management and pretty sure they didnt like me but i worked hard and tried my best everyday. They didnt appreciate the work I put in and just judged me for the mistakes i made. I know I did make mistakes and i dont want to sound like im entitled to anything but it sucked... alot.(pardon) When i first came the managment was out on leave for like a couple months and it was really poorly timed and yeah. I did as much as the manager did and they changed my schedual without telling me all the time and cut my hours and eventually they did that and i had 3 scheduals for one week and by the time I checked my schedual one day and it was too late and they fired me. Which was nothing new people get fired all the time simply because they are people and are liveing life and have to do any other thing other than work. Working here was draining and horrible. Mainly because management. Some people were fun and nice and made the job easier but they ignored my requests and nearly everything i said and yeah.
bad,I was worked at target as as a seasonal and I couldn't find more about target . it should be a more than year working at a place to say something about .
bad,Too many bosses and not enough people to do the work load. Hours being cut after the schedule is published and management knows well in advance of the schedule coming out so scheduling is never correct.
bad,I like how Target puts their guest first. They strive to pay attention to all of their guests needs and concerns. What I least like about target is that they do not offer enough pay for the amount of  experience that I bring and no healthcare for part-timers.
bad,"please do not work for target's distribution center ! benefits suck ,  they treat us like slaves while they treat the store employees like gold ! work for the store"
bad,Started early in the morning to unload a semi-truck and then stock all the goods in the correct locations. A lot of hard labor and not many hours.  We worked in a large group to get everything done before 10 am most days.
bad,"Guest services taking care of guests by phone contact inquiries and at desk. worked sales floor. This environment was very physical and hours were as late as they needed you to stay. There was a schedule and you couldn't count on in. It was difficult to makes plans in my personal life. Management just average. Most Managers were unpleasant. Very fast pace and sometimes unrealistic demands. The entire team experienced difficulties. We still worked well together and produced the best we could with the high work volumes.I thought this would be new and a fun change. I left voluntarily 10/2013."
bad,The management and corporate leaders did not care for the  underling. No advancements and no pay increases. Abused employees by making them stay longer shifts yet write them up if any over time accrued.
bad,"Hard to actually advance to a higher position. Only matters if you push red cards. If you are a good worker but don't get people to get red cards then you don't get anything. But if you are the opposite, you can advance anywhere you want. The atmosphere is good but with the few hours and little to no raises, its not somewhere you want to be for a long time. I would recommend working here if you can get a high position."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid seems to be a mantra that exists within the lower class working world these days, but this particular employer fits the rallying cry. A corporation that talks about ""Teamwork"" being one of its core fundamentals, yet management only seeks to save their own hide from the core problem the store has. Themselves. I would recommend Target to someone who is in need of the money, as they are rather good at working with your schedule and offering you the hours if you need them, yet I leave you with this bittersweet taste in your mouth by saying that you must be ready to cast aside what pride you have, because the management really doesn't care as long as their day is completed and their scores look good. Employees who have been there for longer than you will get away with more than you will; you could be running around until your feet are sore and you are on the brink of exhaustion, yet you are not working ""hard enough"" or ""smart enough"". Going to HR does nothing, unless you are willing to cause headaches for a ""basically minimum wage"" job, because their open door policy only means that they know the person who can have their hours chopped."
bad,"There is no room to grow or climb higher up the corporate ladder there. They ask the employers to do impossible things for the minimum wage such as fill over 10 pallets in as little as an hour or two. "
bad,part time job with poor pay and prospects co-workers generally good hard working people who need a better job management is all about management  the best part of the job is going home when the economy crashed this was what I could find will change jobs soon
bad,"My job is repetitive, boring and mundane. There is very little room for advancement, no benefits, undertrained management and part time hours unless you're salary. I don't really have anything nice to say about this employer other than you may be lucky to develop and keep good friendships with your fellow employees because you all suffer the same fate."
bad,"I am very overqualified for the position I am doing and the job offers no upward movement, everyone in management is younger than me and very inexperienced, I feel like the current workforce are guinea pigs to see what will happen. I do the same easy repetitive tasks everyday and get bored out of my mind, the best thing about the job is the coworkers, there is nothing else good about the job."
bad,Worked here for 2 month's and did everything I was asked for my job and more and was fired and the reason was I didn't meet their expectations. Not to mention I quit my fulltime job to come here because it was closer to my house. Upon my interview I was told I would be fulltime then I later found out I was hired as part-time when I did my orientation. I only worked 4 hours a day 12 hours max during the week. I had wondered before I started why did they fire so many employees at once. Management has their favorites here I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here. If you do then be prepared to be fired without any reasoning.
bad,smh...i never worked for a more disgusting company in my life they work you literally to death everyone that i started off with within 4 months left due to work load and stress.
bad,"The experience is what you make it. Not the same for all stores but there is no work/life balance, not as flexible with scheduling as they say. Upper management in my store is horrible and that goes right along with the communication in the building."
bad,"A typical day will start out at 4 in the morning. we arrive to unload the truck by hand, put the freight on pallets, and then pull the pallets to floor with pallet jacks. Then we begin to push freight until the entire store has been stocked. Our managers have no idea what they are doing, there is almost no way to advance, and we are always looked down upon because we are the ones stocking shelves."
bad,"Being employed at Target would be a great opportunity for someone who is new to retail or is currently a student. However, the pay is not the best considering how much work one is expected to do. The communication is also very poor. I had the opportunity to take on new positions and was able to help out when team members were unable to complete their work task."
bad,I learn from co-workers how not to treat employees and other co-workers. I really enjoyed the work I did but the management above me needs to learn how to treat personal. T
bad,A strenuous work environment due to the large store itself and the understaffed facility.
bad,"Lack of productive interaction between workers and management. Customer service skills a plus. Typical shift 4 to 8 hours, twice per week. No job security."
bad,"A good place to gain experience, but not a good place to start a career. I was told many empty promises about opportunities for advancement, and eventually went elsewhere to take advantage of real opportunities."
bad,A typical day would consist of unloading inbound trucks in order to be able to restock store for guest.
bad,"I often began the day not knowing what tasks needed to be done so I would proceed with the routine things.  I worked there for almost two years before I heard from a manager from another Target that the manager on duty was responsible for the work plan for the day and was supposed to help us get it done.  Tasks were often assigned that were impossible to complete on a regular shift. I was frustrated with having to go up to the front to be a back up cashier several times during my shift which kept me from getting my work done."
bad,"no questions get answered, or when they do, its false information. over hire staff and then finds reasons to fire people who are doing a good job."
bad,"Handle Customer complaints and returns"
bad,Lavoro ottimo ma troppe pressioni per sviluppo vendita troppo esoso
bad,"Retail job,don't know when you are working no set work hours"
bad,The only reason I rated a low review is because of management. They did not focus on the employee's. They had favoritism. I was the only cashier to show up on Black Friday and pushed myself so hard to give the customers an enjoyable experience and fast check out. They finally had the supervisors jump on the lanes when the lane was far too long. I also asked to learn more areas of the store. Always asking for more hours and more experience. Seems a lot of companies no longer like a hard worker with motivation to do better. I exceeded in credit card applications and always had a clean area. My everyday customers would come to my lane with a smile knowing I'd give them a good laugh and a cheery disposition. The customers made my job worth it. The hardest part was the employees and management.
bad,I would go to work not knowing what department I was going to be in. I showed up early and to every shift scheduled. I was a very hard worker who was mistreated by management on several different occasions. No matter how I was treated I still maintained my cool and did what needed to be done.
bad,"For the past few months, things have been going down hill. As far as management it has not been good at all. Typical days I would stock up the shelves and assist guests with their needs I.e. getting items that are not on the sales floor from the back room and bringing it to them. I am also a certified back room team member."
bad,"Like any other big box discount retailer, this company favors bottom line profit over employee development.  The management often sets their employees up for impossible goals and then admonishes them for not reaching them.  When an employee reaches a goal, the recognition is often given to mid-level management that truly had nothing to do with the achievement.  Compensation is on an hourly basis with menial yearly merit increases."
bad,"The customers and co-workers are the best part of the job,  Some of the managers are great and others not so much.  "
bad,"Working overnight was a blast. There was no customers to assist, just me doing my job. Day time was a nightmare because you could not get any work done and assist all the customers and were constantly being called up to the front to back up cashiers"
bad,"some managers & dept. managers play favorites,if your not then you get less hours,more nights, my co-workers were great the enjoyable part was the free food"
bad,No place for advancement. Management always looks for fault to get rid of individual.
bad,"not fun doing cart attendant duties, cleaning restrooms were horrible, supervisors expected cart attendant to do all their duties plus help with others;."
bad,"I learned that I really enjoy working with people, and helping those that needed my help."
bad,A typical day at work would be to be as fast as possible and not having to worry about your job.
bad,It offers no opportunity for advancement and poor management!
bad,mostly friendly. some discrimination for being new. Really don't like how new people are treated. management is not interested in making things better for the employees.
bad,Very busy days
bad,A work day was pretty collected at times until other staffing would not come to work and a constant call was placed to work more when classes were supposed to be worked around but actually weren't.
bad,"The HR department lies and gives all these false hope on how you would be able to advance quickly in the buisness. Not to mention, you literally have to beg and scramble just to acquire some hours to have a decent amount on your paycheck. Too much work for very little pay. The organization is very disorganized not to mention, the supervisors, coworkers, & customers as a whole are very rude & inconsiderate. In addition, there's very little chance in securing your job if you take leave. I.E: Maternity leave. You have to beg and plead to ask for that time off"
bad,Typical day was very busy and you come across all sort of people and different attitudes. My co-works I love and management is not on one page. The hardest thing of my job is that you cant let everything get to you because people will have problems without it being your fault. So you have to have a smile threw out it all and I had to learn that. Most enjoyable was customers who treated you with the up most respect and that they always made your day. Having fun with your co-workers even when management try to over do you with work. It was all about making the best out of what you have and making sure your job is done
bad,Overall experience was not great. Management was terrible and work/life balance is impossible to maintain. Never compensated for the hard work put in by employees. Would not recommend this employer to anyone.
bad,Target has some top quality clothing and now the stores have groceries as well.
bad,"I help customers on a daily basis. Make exchanges and returns, take payments, and answer phone calls. Do what it takes to make the customer happy"
bad,the management and co-workers are mean. i had co-workers who smoked pot on the job and when management was informed they did nothing. when i became pregnant while working there and my manager my job harder on me and made me feel like i was an outcast.
bad,You can not get a decent rate of pay or advancement. I can hardly believe a company of this size can get away with how they treat employees.
bad,Great place to work for students in high school or attending college very flexable to students. As for advancing in a career not easy at all. It is harder for current employees to advance over graduating students new to the company.
bad,I worked for target for seven years and I spent time on the logistics team learning how to stock the sales floor. I would unload the trucks and stock the shelves. Help out with the customer service as a cashier.
bad,"Target DOES NOT believe in promoting from within...as soon as you are close to qualifying for benefits, your hours get cut in half"
bad,Never worked at a place where other duties meant everyone else's job along with your job title. Everyone else didn't even touch your job
bad,"This company is not a good company to work for... they dont take care of there team member, I was in charge of the front end, Service desk, starbucks, food aver, booking, and 27 registers and only getting 8.20, dont give raise only once a year, that was only .05 cents cause i was late like 3 times...but i dont deserve that, have to support a famly and pay bills and live off 900.00 a month...Lets be real, if your in collage or in high school this job for you, but if you have a family and in adult this job is not for you.."
bad,"I have never worked for a company that is so demeaning and dismissive of long time employees. Corporate (upper management) is proud and callous, unreachable."
bad,"1.) They increased the amount of work I was expected to do, and decreased the amount of time I had to complete this work."
bad,"unfair place to work, terrible management skills. underpaid, unfair rights and unstable working conditions. unfair team members, and management staff."
bad,I felt a lot of discrimination and favoritism towards friends.  Felt like I was singled out for reporting co-workers who were not adhering to Target's policies and for complaining about late or lack of government-required breaks due to my health issues.
bad,Management is a joke they all follow their own rules not by a company standpoint pick in choose when to discipline for safety. Worse place to work!!!!
bad,"Had managers letting whiny bad workers basically control scheduling rather than being confrontational. The starbucks at the target doesn't even wash dishes with soap, actually super gross"
bad,"This is a company that makes you think they care and want the best for you but at the end of the day they care only for themselves. The management is the worst they all talk bad about their employees, have no respect for them."
bad,The only concern is for numbers. Employees are worked very hard for low pay and not made to feel appreciated. The store STL is extremely rude. Most people have left or have plans to leave as soon as possible. It use to be a nice environment.  Not anymore.
bad,"Every position has daily routines. "
bad,"My experience with Target was one of highschool cliques. My assistant manager was friends with HR and the other assistants. Their personal dislike of me led to having me train new associates to fill a position I had experience in. I was denied promotion and when my fiance joined, she was given poor training and excess workload from favored hourly workers. She was then fired for ""poor performance"" and blacklisted. When I suffered appendicitis, they insisted I was faking."
bad,"I came to the conclusion that as a store has a large management change, it affects everyone else (including the guests) who work and shop there. Turnover rate of employees increase, workplace culture becomes dim and employees start to get anxious. Overall, I think I would have remained at Target for quite a while if the Management team that hired me remained in their respective roles at the company."
bad,"My short time w Target was not due to a lack of enthusiasm exactly but rather poor staff budgeting by front end manager. Her poor abilities caused a reduction in most everyone's hours from 25-32 hours or more down to between 4,8 and 10hrs per week. Now I ask you.. who can live on that?"
bad,"From the hiring process to the actual job, Target is incredibly ineffective and inefficient. It took over two weeks from the interview to my start date. Management remains so focused on driving hourly targets that they ignore the vital aspects of running a business. If staff do not meet goals, leaders do not step in to assist.. they simply remind you that you must meet your goals or else it shows you do not care about customers."
bad,"I worked here from july until November. The worst experience I've ever been a part of. They say the customer comes first, but if its busy then you get written up for prioritizing the customer. They will always give you impossible tasks, and they do not care for your well-being. I was written up for ""no-call no-show"" because I was in an accident and called after 10am. Even after showing them the police and accident report. Do yourself a favour and save yourself"
bad,Had about 20hrs per week until I filed a discrimination complaint for the way I was treated. After filing the complaint they cut my hours down to 4 per week. I left and would never go back to the Elgin store
bad,Management  doesn't  care  about  my concerns  or needs as a cashier. I have  worked  at  Target  for 7 years.  I am now  looking  for  other  employment  opportunities  because  of the callous  disregard  that has occurred  at this Target in Phillipsburg  New Jersey.
bad,"You are in huge isles by yourself for hours. When you take a bathroom break, a few hours later you are asked why you haven't scanned for those 2 minutes. The management only cares about quantity, not quality. So we had a lot of returns."
bad,"I have nothing more to say about this company this has been been a struggle for me , I been out on maternity leave for two months and could not get paid because my manager would not give me over 20 hours not to mention I quit my other job for them . Great job for a teenager with no bills!"
bad,"Was constantly overworked without access to water or seating. Nobody cared about their jobs, even managers. It was constantly packed in the back room so nobody could walk back there."
bad,"You applied for full time and they give you part time to work. Managers aren’t professionals, supervisors are very young. A lot of favoritism is shown, you’re on your feet all day. No benefits, after the 2 weeks of pay expect a lot of tax deductions."
bad,Stop emphasising on those red cards.People dont want to hear about it every time they go shop at each of your stores.Have a talk with your marketing person.If people want a card they will ask for one.
bad,"Would not cross-train me for anything else in the store. The only thing that mattered was number of RED card signups I got or attempted that week, no praise for succeeding in other areas like fast checkout speed or high quality customer service. Managers were nice to your face, complained about you behind your back to other coworkers."
bad,Target was a good job while going to school but the management had unrealistic expectations and not enough skills were taught to fulfill their expectations.
bad,"In the year that I have been employeed at Target, I have not seen one team member move up. The expectation of the daily work load is almost unattainable. If you are not willing to have a full seven day open schedule for them to work with, you are limited on hours. There are time when upper managment makes it feel like it is either Target or your family."
bad,"Worked there for seven years, I was never happy, felt sick going to work. But I had no choice, I needed money. They made us stay till 3 or 4 am and never let us go home."
bad,"The typical day at work for me involved preparing food, cleaning, and selling food to customers. The management here was poor and quite confusing on what they wanted to be done and when. Overall I don’t think the workplace culture or experience as a whole was very healthy."
bad,they told me I would be working 8 hours shifts 40 hours a week before hire. After I got hired I was working 5 hours shifts 25 hours a week and they kept cutting my hours every week. Poor scheduling & unorganized. They need people but won’t give anybody more hours
bad,"No opportunities to advance. Pay was also raised, but hours were cut. Management does not listen to employee suggestions. Management does not act professionally."
bad,Employees/Employers were extremely rude the whole time I was being trained and talking down to me. Didn't feel welcomed in the lunch room or anywhere in building.
bad,"Management only cares about how much money the company can make, they do not care about our financial situation, not enough hours to pay my bills or car gas, it's not worth driving 20 miles to work for the minimal amount of hours I get."
bad,A typical day entailed struggling to finish the morning truck then struggling to unload night truck with minimum staffing. HR is unreliable and wildly unprofessional while berating coworkers for attempting to leave. The STL spends most of the day decorating her office and is unwilling to help coworkers while also babysitting children. At one point in the 4th quarter of 2018 the STL had a 10-12 year old helping Ship-to-Store and I  even witnessed her throwing boxes in the baler.
bad,The management was rude and talk about you behind your back. They hound you to work faster but wouldn't allow you to work more than a few hours to do the stocking for a whole truck.
bad,"Young kids in charge playing with people's lives. What happened to our society?   There should be a mandatory age before they let these children play ""store"" . The one fooling around,that's the mgmt"
bad,Management is terrible and unorganized. They do not work with you and your school schedule when you need it to be changed to accommodate. I left work one day two hours early because I needed time for school work which I was having trouble getting done. They didn't want to hear my request and didn't care. I called to let them know that I was coming in on my next shift but they terminated me within one day or me leaving only 2 hours early. I did let someone know but my manager claimed that I didn't. Please save yourself the time and do not work for target.
bad,At first it was a good company to work for until you show them you have a brain and you can think for yourself. The Gen manager was cool but the other one had it out for me because I worked better than the rest and got complaints.
bad,"Managers are extremely unprofessional, unorthodox, lazy, and unreliable. They want you to work like a slave for little pay. Store is always unorganized with no direction. Store managers do not care to accommodate any employee needs unless they’re, “butt-kissers.” They’re always gossiping and terminating employees for personal vendettas. There’s a tremendous amount of favoritism going on. Acceptional work ethic is not reconized. They don’t care for employee safety."
bad,"I’ve been a manager and assistant manager at other retail stores and none were ever as poorly run as target, the “ETLs” & “TLs” aka managers and assistant managers ALL are absolutely terrible. They have no sense of direction, are little to no help and sit at the in store Starbucks for almost 2 hours EVERY single morning. A few employees got fired for “stealing time” when going over a few mins on their 15 minute break all the ETLs and TLs do is steal time. Whether it’s sitting at Starbucks for 2 hours every day or walking the store an unlimited amount of times and not lifting a finger to help their team members. Quite possibly the worst retail experience I’ve ever had in my working life. To top it off there’s absolutely no way to get promoted in the company unless you suck up and if you’re like me, you have more respect and integrity for yourself to do so. Somehow if things don’t get done it’s your fault rather than their lack of common sense to see we’re consistently understaffed and have an over abundance of freight coming in daily, some days we’re  so overwhelmed yet still don’t get the proper backup and support from our superiors."
bad,There was a lot of pressure coming from manager to sales floor workers. They had favoritism when it came to different workers. Always short staffed and not fun
bad,"I may have just had a bad location as I have seen very hit or miss reviews of Target. I worked at Target but was cross trained and also worked in their Starbucks. The pay seems great for most retail or food service jobs but they are definitely underpaying you for having to do the work of 2-3 other people. We were always understaffed and they continuously kept cutting hours which would leave us alone at Starbucks for hours per shift."
bad,"I had been working closely with several members of management, prepping for interviews for advancement within the company. I was told that I had everything they were looking for in a team lead, and they were just waiting for a job opening. I became pregnant, and immediately notified the manager  I was training with. I explained that my desire to advance was not changed at all, and I wished to continue to pursue it. "
bad,"Turn over rate high, seem to value college degree over years of experience within company,no stop work loads with in various departments, very ""pushy"" about there credit cards, HR was unreliable in any problems that needs attention, discards employees without consideration."
bad,"I applied to this job with an open availability, but a situation came up and I couldn't work nights anymore. Trying to describe that to the management here was like pulling teeth. They do not work with you AT ALL about schedule changes and really with anything else for that matter. I put in my two weeks and they terminated me the day after I submitted my resignation without even giving me an option to finish the time."
bad,"Target like most employers pitch a nice game to attract employees but once you're in the masks come off and reality sets in. I feel that if prospective employees have to be honest during the interview/hiring processes, the employers should be held to the same standards: Dear Employers, don't blow unicorn dust up our butts just to get what you want from people."
bad,Target is just your average run of the mill super store.  Its just a job to have some sort of income.  Unless your a die hard employee and want to make a career there don't bother with a promotion.
bad,"They don't work well with schedules and couldn't care less about your family. Management is never on the same page and are very power hungry. Plus they don't like to train any new workers so everything is a mess. I could go on and on about the bad things but one good thing there is the pay, as much as the job sucks some times. And your hour vary on every schedule. I have worked there for 2 years now and still get 40 hours one week, and 10 the next."
bad,Customer and money come before all employees. Management don’t know what they are doing and are fine overworking you as long as you give them their coffee.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"This job has the ability to latch you in with a high pay rate at first but after your 90 days, they will abuse your availability and give you bottom of the barrel shifts. Local management/HR is poorly managed and like to abuse their power to make sure you do their work. Management will put your life in danger, they will make you work outside during unsafe weather conditions without proper equipment."
bad,"Started working the first week of November.  Never given instructions on what equipment I needed to work in the backroom other that the hand held scanner.  I picked the walkie talkie up cause everyone else did.  I asked for full time (40 hrs).  Was scheduled for Black Friday when I said I could not work then.  Never got 40 hrs.  Its retail."
bad,"A very stressful role, almost everything is on a short term time limit, management and other employees don't take very good care of the3 store and making sure everything is where its suppose to be. They give no more than 15-30 hours a week to everyone."
bad,"This was the worst job experience of my entire life! Never in my life have I worked for a more incompetent management staff, the store mgr. is obnoxious, self-serving and very denigrating toward the floor employees. "
bad,At my store there was constant bickering because no one would come to work with poor managers. Nothing was ever good enough and the pay was not nearly enough.
bad,"Managers let the lunatics run the asylum. If one of their favorites don't like you, it will be hard for you to work there. they need to change the culture of that place, management only listens to rumors and they break company policy by hanging out with their employees."
bad,The manager are not fair to staff definitely favoritisms with the head manager and Spanish staff sometimes no breaks manger gets rude when u need to take a day off for kids or family emergency
bad,Target was a very dramatic and stressful place to work. I was told because I was pregnant I would not be able to advance. They were not very accommodating ti my schedule once I came back to work after having my baby.
bad,"Don’t do it "
bad,"Management is extremely corrupt. They hired me in knowing that I wanted at LEAST 25 hours a week. They said no problem and hired me. At the very end of orientation they literally sat and told me that I’ll be getting less than half of the hours i requested. And that my schedule is unchangeable by any means i.e. school/ second job, also told me that I cannot get more hours or less, cannot cross train into something else to obtain more hours, cannot work at multiple locations at one level, . Oh and you pretty much cannot two then nonto anything otherwise you will legit be on their bad side forever..they will literally subliminally hate you.. but hey, 13 and hour."
bad,"As I started out the job was great. Over time management became worse and hours continued to decrease. My original position was GSA and then demoted to Electronics due to my age at the time of hire for GSA. Unfortunately the store I worked at did not appreciate it's workers nor did it make team members happy. As to my knowledge, as of my last day 3 more workers have left due to management."
bad,"The job culture has changed drastically from where it once was."
bad,"My supervisor made me feel stupid and incompetent for not working as fast as the other employees on my first solo day, and continued to make me feel stupid and incompetent throughout my time there. I asked someone higher up to be put in a certain position permanently, but it was not communicated with the person in charge of giving out positions. There is a huge, stressful workload. I applied for the job because it would be early mornings and was told so in the interview, but then I was told I was gonna be transitioned into working days without them asking me if that’s what I wanted, and in a position I didn’t want to work in. They also would frequently schedule me against my availability. I also never finished my computer orientation."
bad,"My managers did not respect my reported availability when making my schedules and would schedule me during my class times. When I would point out the mistake to my supervisor she would tell me it was my responsibility to find someone to cover the shift. They would set redcard goals and would badger you if you weren't selling enough redcards, threatening firing for low sellers. The employee discount was miserable and only available for use if you were paying with cash or a redcard."
bad,"While it is a great paying job, not being able to enjoy a work-home balance due to their everchanging rules on mandatory overtime and ability to use the vacation days you accrue. I feel the management is poor on most part and communication between the supervisors is almost non-existent"
bad,"Constantly changing rules and how things are done but not for the better, in the course of a year nothing ever became more efficient or easier despite efforts. Good pay, but low morale. Feels very discouraging all of the time (but probably just because of the team leads at my particular store, other stores might be more pleasant to work at). It’s a tolerable job when you know you’re going to move on to something else soon."
bad,"Even if this is your first job, don't let the managers see you as naive and overly willing because they will bombard you with an unreasonable amount of work. Some managers maybe nice but like with all jobs, there are bound to be managers who don't know what they're doing and/or will try to impose their ""authority"" onto you. Also, although Target managers may be looking for people with great communication skills, I've found they are not practicing that skill leading to team members being reprimanded because of the lack of communication."
bad,I felt very singled out at this job and it seemed like since I didn't fit into their clique everyone stayed away from me and gave me unfair treatment when I needed something.
bad,Target was constantly understaffed and set unrealistic expectations for the very few people who would work the shifts. Management was poor and scheduling was a nightmare. It is a very high stress job and I would not recommend working there under any circumstances ever.
bad,"Target is a great place to work for part time employees, but is a bit more challenging if you are looking for full time work. For those seeking to work their way into management, be aware the responsibilities and stress increase with salary, but I'm sure that's common for most companies in general."
bad,"I was super excited about this job! It was like it was too good to be true when I was hired. I found out about a week into the job that I couldn’t use my employee discount unless I had a red card, paid in cash, or use a gift card. Why should I make accommodations to use my employee discount?"
bad,"The managers tended to tell employees what to do without taking into consideration other circumstances of the job. Many workers spread rumors. The work was dull, and once first quarter rolled around, hours were cut so that employees were not scheduled more than 30 hours a week. The pay is decent, especially for a part-time job, but the other aspects of work there were not worth being there."
bad,"Target used to be very balanced out with management. These days it based on the store managers if they choose to follow policy or not. It becomes a favoritism game between employees, leads, and guests even. I believe the managers in Target need to be kept under a tighter microscope to be able to make sure all roles, and policies are properly executed."
bad,"Department managers treat employees badly. No respect at all, lots of being spoken down to or being treated like a child. Ridiculous expectations of work. Seemingly constant corporate restructuring of store roles for the sake of ""modernization"". In short target is a company that wants to be viewed as the good guy but behind the scenes, its just a more hip and trendy looking walmart."
bad,I use to love working for target and thought I would build a career there. The new upper (ETL)management are extremly petty and unprofessional. Your business is never confidential. You express a issue dealing or not dealing with target and half the store Is asking you about it two days later. The favoritism is blatant and kept under wraps. I DO NOT recommend you working there unless you don't mind living out on the streets with the hours you're given.. Unless it's a holiday then they work you like it's no tomorrow. Target has fallen to the waist side. I can't wait to leave!!
bad,"Dont work here, they gave me 15 hours a week. They didn’t care about your health. If you hit your head and need serious care, they don’t care at all.."
bad,"The only people I would encourage to work at Target are folks that need flexibility in their schedule, including students, or individuals needing work experience. The only positive thing that I got from Target is people I still consider friends today. And the awareness that I was worth better. Target is antiunion and showed us antiunion propaganda in their orientation videos. When I got hired, open enrollment had just closed for health insurance, so I was employed for almost a year before I got coverage. My last supervisor spied on us in the aisles to make sure we weren't talking to each other. When I told our store manager the concerns I had plus what I had been told about other problematic behavior towards my coworkers, she stated that he was helping the store to hit the bottom line, and that trumped any of the other concerns. He was rude, condescending, and unprofessional and the manager did not seem to care. When I legitimately called in sick, I saw a direct retaliation on my next schedule with decreased hours. I saw so many of my coworkers get let go for what appeared to be minor infractions- it happened frequently enough that I constantly feared I could lose my job. One year they tried to give me a 3 cent raise. Why would I want to work hard for them with such an unacceptable raise? This was a toxic work environment and I couldn't be happier to have left."
bad,"it was a job to help me through full time college courses and i think that it was okay considering it was my first job and i stayed for four years. management could improve definitely, so much drama and politics and not enough advancements for their team members."
bad,"a typical day is gotta get it done no matter how poorly it is done ( i.e. not rotating the stock)  what have i learned that no matter what i will not be taken advantage of.  The management changes every few years the good ones I am sad to say  are far and few between.  The work place culture has been getting worse.  Targets motto used to be fast, fun and friendly.  now not so much,  The hardest part of my job is not having the leaders care if the work gets done in a timely manner,  It is important in my view to make sure that the guest has the correct price for their items.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was a ""family"" even though it was a sad time.  For example when a coworker was killed the team got together and helped his family pay for the service and gave their ""time"" so his wife could take time off to heal with out losing her job"
bad,"Target on Atlantic Ave has to be one of the worst stores to work for. There is no room for advancement, if you work overnight. They only how you can advance is if your sucking up to the Executives and TL’s overnight. Everything is based if favoritism and it doesn’t help that TL’s and sleeping with Team Members. No overtime is allowed unless your a favorite. TL’s and extremely disrespectful to Team Members.  It’s just a horrible work culture overall"
bad,There was never a supervisor around for help with any questions or to make sure people were doing their job.  Never any praise for doing more work than expected.
bad,"This is one of those jobs people do just because it pays the bills"
bad,The job itself wasnt horrible but the managers were utterly pathetic. They run the place like your nothing but a body to be used and tossed away they need to learn what a team is
bad,"Management is ran by multiple young women who have no idea what they’re doing and HR is a bigger joke, whenever I had a question about ANYTHING they never knew the answer or tried to give me an answer. If you did a good job you don’t get noticed you just get your hours taken away for no reason. The lack of communication between the managers and employees is a joke. So are the managers."
bad,"when i first started working here i loved it. i loved coming into work and i loved the hours i was getting it was perfect for me. Since January things have turned for the worst, target calls it ""modernization."" The hours have been getting cut to where i can't pay my bills and barely feed myself, people that have come in as seasonal are getting more hours than people who have been here for 5 years or more, they're expecting more from us in a small amount of time which is making work stressful and everyone is in a bad mood all the time. more than half my coworkers that haven't already quit are starting to look for new jobs. if you're looking to get 2 days a week than this job is perfect for you."
bad,No recognition from management even if you do your best to go above and beyond. The management team plays favorites and will promote someone they like before someone who has been there longer. They expect way you to do more stuff then you have time for. One of the only good things about working here is they're pretty flexible with your hours.
bad,"Worked here in the produce department. I was trying to get into the backroom/backstock area forever. They never fully sent me there, instead ""cross trained"" me and had me help out from time to time."
bad,Not the best esxperience very under kept and managers didnt care too much. The store is now closed and I do believe it has something to do with the managers as well as the area not being good for that kind of store.
bad,"A typical day at work was stressful"
bad,"So not sure what management knows what they are doing. continue to hire new people when they dont have any hours to give. All my coworkers need a second or third job just to support themselves. Do not work for SFS. Hours get cut the most and when the Department closes, it means you dont work for months. Mine closed 3 times since working there. Love my coworkers, everyone is pretty easy to get along with. The workload is pretty chill. Sometimes free snacks in the breakroom. Bottom line, if you work here youre gonna need a second job."
bad,"The day typically starts with everything that the team is doing wrong with no advice or help, basically told to figure everything out on your own. Can't take sanitation precautions. The best part of the job is going home."
bad,"Management would bet with each other on which cashier was going to call out next. RedCard sign ups were pushed VERY hard at my location, while to CSR's would sit on their butts using their phones."
bad,Unnecessary changes to daily work routine for basic sales floor and flow team members has made their days harder for no reason.  The sales floor and backroom are now more disorganized and less efficient than I have ever seen.  Management keeps coming up with justifications and small adjustments that only frustrate the lower wage workers more.  Recent hour cuts are also affecting workers as they are expected to do more with less time in a less ideal environment for efficient work.
bad,"Management is pretty awful about whats efficient,whats expected, and how much time is given to you to do everything. Most nights don't expect to leave early. The morning crews have no idea how bad it gates later in the day because they never have to close and as such expect you to do too much in the short amount of time you are given."
bad,It was an okay job until it came to fixing the schedule. I would not recommend this to anyone who doesn’t have an open schedule. When hired it took a month to get a call back for orientation.
bad,"Management did not support employees or even acknowledge them unless red cards ( target debit and credit cards) were being pushed on customers. Only promoted their favorites. Salaries for people that were there the longest were virtually the same as those for new entry level employees due to state wage increases and low raise percentages. Some people only received a few cents raises and when the new employees received the new state minimums, old employees didnt receive any increase. Some promotions only came with $0.50 raises."
bad,"At first working there is an amazing experience, but after a while things turn to crud. The team leads don't care, the HR that you are supposed to trust to help you in tough situations don't do anything, you get in trouble for the simplest of things, and there is so much drama there. Also, the pay there is horrible. As soon as you learn something over there it's every man for himself instead of getting any type of assistance. And anything you do accomplish someone else gets the credit for it, they never acknowledge the person who actually came up with an idea or got what they needed done or went beyond and over what was needed to get done."
bad,"the atmosphere is crazy, young kids speaking to adults like they have no home training. I could not stand it any longer, maybe because when you are asking in the interview what days and hours can you work, and then you work those hours the first week, but the second week, you are given the complete opposite of what you requested. Why play with peoples lives, Do not work here unless you have no family."
bad,"Typical retail positions and schedule. As long as you keep that in mind, enjoy your coworkers and every opportunity you have to interact with customers."
bad,"Team leads often show favoritism towards certain team members and often have lacked professionalism, in store HR does nothing to resolve these issues."
bad,The downsides would be not enough hours and not much advancement of growth opportunities within targets company. Management treats workers like garbage as well as team leaders they act like they are better than you. I would recommend this job for someone who is interested in first time retail work but not someone who is currently 20 and up. There's lack of hours. There’s a lack is help from your team members as well. They do offer a 10% discount. You must use cash only to use your discount unless you get a Target Red Card which gives you an additional 5%. If you don’t use the card or cash you can’t use your discount.
bad,"The worst part is the scheduling and the lack of staff. Often there will only be 2 people working at a time, however since many of the associates have children, they have to be gone by 2-3 p.m on weekdays and don't work on weekends. This wouldn't be an issue if there was another associate working. Certain employees are left to run the entire establishment by themselves during busy times for 2, 3 hours sometimes. Then on Saturday evenings, they'll have you close by yourself yet expect you to service customers, clean up, wash all the dishes, clean the food area/tables and clock out 30 minutes after closing (needless to say I always clock out much later than I'm scheduled to). Yet HR never fixes the schedule so you're never alone. If there were ALWAYS 2 people working the job would be a cake walk, but when one person is expected to do Everything you realize you're being taken advantage of. If I'm going to be doing the job of 2 people, my paycheck should reflect that..."
bad,"Working in softlines or A&A team was an unpleasant experience with lack of communication from the higher-ups. I always clocked out feeling frustrated and unsatisfied. The stress was too much for me. However, the pay was nice and if you are looking for a temporary job with decent pay I would only recommend if you need a job fast. I really enjoyed my coworkers though. Without them, I am sure I would have quit sooner. Working at Target was a good learning experience."
bad,Hard work for expensive benefits and no opportunity for advancement.  Long term was averaging a pay cut every year when compared to the increase in benefit cost.
bad,"The management is very favoritisms with employees. If they don’t like you, you won’t get hours and they will not work with your schedule. I needed to change my availability for school and they denied it. The guests are rude and inconsiderate."
bad,This was not an enjoyable place to work. You were constantly pushed  to achieve production no matter what the circumstances were. Management would hide and watch your every move.
bad,"If you need a job target is fine, say a summer job for school kids or another pay check its alright but if you need a job to pay the bills would recommend something else, unless there is nothing left. The place wasn't for me."
bad,"Sometimes you were pulled from somewhere to finish for others. "
bad,"I grew very fast in this company because of my work ethic but the environment is toxic in preventing you from growth no one wants to see you excel, and once you start showing signs of growth negativity rushes in to deter you from progress."
bad,Working at Target is for individuals who are capable of working very long shifts which include leaving work as late as midnight and returning back to work as early as 6am.
bad,"During the interview they are really nice. They tell you a lot of things that Target can do for you. Job advancement, flexible hours, and friendly management. It was all lies. There have been people working there for 20 years and their managers have only been there for 5 months to one year. You can't progress in your job without college. They are very inflexible with hours. Mandatory overtime is the worst thing ever. A few of my co workers had to quit because they were told they didn't have to work overtime because they had a second job but got constant write ups for not showing up on their mandatory OT days. The amount of favoritism is insane. During peak seasons you work 6 days a week and the managers don't care if you are tired. They will simply say that you have to take better care of yourself. They don't care about the people, they only care about making numbers. To target you aren't a person you are a machine. If you are injured they don't care either. They threatened someone his job cause he wasn't coming to work. He has a broken arm and dislocated shoulder. They made him work in the office instead of in the warehouse. How nice of target"
bad,"A certain mananger were careless about his team members, staff, ect and was constantly making rude suggestive remarks towards a handfull of my old co-workers"
bad,"Having worked for this company for nearly 6 months I have nothing good to say, the management gets away with harassing/belittling employees despite other managers being aware of the issue, the back rooms are constant safety/fire hazards, schedules fluctuate wildly and scheduled hours can and will be rescinded if the store is over limit on payroll with no warning, there is no way to transfer from seasonal to full time hire and if you are ""seasonal,"" you can expect to get shoved out the door if the store goes overlimit on payroll."
bad,"Used to be a good play to work, but they no longer focus on work/life balance. Constantly raising amount of workload but providing les payroll to complete it."
bad,Summary says it all. Managers dont care about your availability no matter how many tines you bring it up to them. Pay is good for retail but you still have to live paycheck to paycheck.
bad,would not advice for anyone who wants a balanced work schedule. was not friendly when it came to balance between work and having a life. would always been looked down on if a emergency came up
bad,If you like a lot of change this is the place for you. If you're a patient person you can make your way up the ladder. They're very much into their red card
bad,When I went to work it was my mission to get everything done before 8 and to productively clean and stay on top of the duties that needed to be done. But most of my co-workers didn't even know that I was a worker there and management never moved me to different parts of the store to work knowing that the Target Team Cafe was not my favorite place to work at.
bad,Very few people are offered full time positions at Target. Middle management is very poor. The days of the week and hours of the day that you are scheduled varies radically so that you have to be available every day of the week from open to close with no perks and a low wage.
bad,"Working at Target was amazing, but all it takes is a manager that doesn't like you or has a personality clash with you and there is nothing you could do, they find ways to let you go."
bad,"I would not recommend target as a place to work. your superiors try to run on fear and intimidation instead of being respectful and professional. the work hours are not reliable, and the head manager questions you when you go to the restroom"
bad,But this place will eat you alive if you stay too long. Ive made some friends working at target but I’ve come across multiple team leads who are very contradicting
bad,"you work with good people but you have managers yelling at you about breaks, bathroom breaks, meeting goals, it becomes stressful. the try to kill you"
bad,"Working for the Target company for 2 years was a slow downhill decent. Near the end of my tenure Target started a ""modernization"" overhaul of the entire Store process leading to unsafe OSHA  regulated work areas and bred contempt between management and workers."
bad,"The team leads are all focused on themselves, and do not take it well if they're approached with help by newer employees. There is no sense authenticity when working as a team. Seniority is valued more than productivity, which creates lack of motivation to work better everyday."
bad,Very repetitive work environment which may include repeated physical demands such as heavy lifting that may leave you with long-term physical pain or even a disability. You many not even qualify for any health benefits as they intentionally try to keep your hours below the qualifying full-time employment mark.
bad,"This was a good job when I started. But as management changed, so did its standards. Management claims they work around your schedules, but time and time again I've seen people get fired because management doesn't want to work around your hours. At first they give you the impression they will and maybe even work around it for a couple of weeks, but then fire you, saying ""This isn't going to work out."" Don't apply. It's not worth it."
bad,Muy pocas horas más o menos la paga es buena necesito más horas de trabajo
bad,Management became horrible. Leads did not know what they were doing. Would stress out team members and expect too much from us. Raises were way too little too.
bad,Target is a great entry level into retail management company. The upper management could care less about the hourly associate. They would rather hire someone with no retail experience as a manager then promote an associates who has worked their way up through all the lead positions and should be promoted to manager.
bad,"Merchandise Flow Team Members work under time constraints to unload, open and stock merchandise onto the shelves.  Benefits at target are non-existent for part time employees."
bad,Targer i work for 2years dang near an soon as my benefits kick in an my raise i started makin less cus then they started to drop my hours like every oherr week an the benefits that they was takin out was killing me even more to the point what i was makin in the beginning was no longer it was less ao please i urge you to not work at Target then it seem like ppl who work 2yrs or more the company/managers were tryna get rid of them lucky to say i fell right in that category
bad,"grateful for the job"
bad,"Target treats their guests with a high regard, however, when it comes to their own employees, there is a highly toxic, stressful work environment that they suffer with. Through terrible leaders and leadership, lack of support, and overall no feeling of importance to the company in general, this would be the last place I would recommend anyone to work in. If you like being told that you're still not fast enough after working as fast as you possibly can, and you like being worked to the bone for little to no recognition for your hard work, this might be the job for you."
bad,"This is not a place that cares about their employees.  There is no appreciation, incentives, advancement or loyalty.  It is an extremely cut throat environment that stems directly from management. Management receives incentives and bonuses for the work that their subordinates perform."
bad,"Do not accommodate people with mental and physical disabilities. Got sick often and was forced to work even when vomited all over the floor twice. Got into an accident one day, and manager flipped out I couldn’t make it in"
bad,"Poor management"
bad,"Team member satisfaction is not a priority. Also, found out I’m being underpaid significantly. "
bad,"i was only a seasonal A.M, stock clerk and moved to seasonal register but management was unbelievable strict about everything including breaks and lunches you only had a one minute window either way to clock in"
bad,"Although I had worked in many comparable environments it was above average in customer service.  I learned the ""anything we can do for you"" model of business."
bad,typical day at target is no hours people always blaming you for stuff they act like you own the store and made what their mad at on purpose. management is terrible and doesn't care to put in any work.
bad,"The first 8 years were good, then the company started realigning, changing hours for different team and doing away with comp pay for early morning shifts. Now they expect you to do your same job (stocking, pricing, resets) during the busy part of the day with very few sales team members, and then write you up for not completing the work for that day. They do not take into consideration the time that you are helping guests, operating the registers or in a 30 minute huddle, or helping put the truck up because of call outs. They expect that you can still get the same amount of work done. As for as work life balance that's a joke. They say they have it but, once you start working it's a different story, even if when you started 10 years ago working 5am to 1pm because that is what is your family life needed just because Target changed doesn't mean that personal life has changed. Kids still get out of school at the same time, have after school activities, Dr appointments, ect, but they no longer care about that."
bad,"I describe Target as Unfair. Once your hired, It's decent but once your Laid off just for being a minor then thats when they resist hiring you in the future."
bad,"If you don't have open availability and can't tolerate being disrespected, Target isn't for you. Management is terrible. The company used to be better."
bad,I thought it  was a good place to work but honesty the management treated their people very poorly.  Do something else other then this awful place. I will say however it was good at first but then went down hill.
bad,Working at Target you have to be able to get multiple red cards a day and be super fast at ringing people up of you get fired. Management was not good at all! When I told them i have to take time off for surgery they let me go for “not getting enough red cards” and then later on I hear she is telling other employees why she let me go.
bad,You must sell their credit card or your gours will be cut. They say you will never be fired for not selling any but my hours were cut back so much I needed to find another job just to keep up with my bills. I personally did not agree with their managment style either. One manager would tell me I'm doing really well and another would say im doing bad and I would have to have a one on one if it continued. No communication. And the discount sucked. Only 10% or get their cc and get 15%.
bad,"This company has made it clear that it wants a high turnaround rate.... If your looking for a summer or temp job Id give this place an A+. if your looking to actually work here....check elsewhere, they treat the full time, dedicated employees who have worked there for 20 years the same as the new ones...and pay the new hires better than the old employees."
bad,I use to love working for target. The store that I work at now is a joke. They are rude when speaking to you. They don't listen to you. They just don't care.
bad,"I’ve been with target for two years, at first things were great. Management changed and it went start down the toilet. There is so much favoritism and criticism in the worst forms possible. Management would talk poorly of employmees when they thought they were alone. They would give all the hardest work to the people they favored the least. I had a manager disrespect me to the point I left the store in tears and nothing happened. I had multiple panic attacks because of the same manager and even went to corporate and they still did nothing. Another employee got hurt on the job and they worked them the same even with doctors restrictions. "
bad,They only care about making money not about you. Plus they now are paying people to start target the same as so.eone that has worked there for many years.
bad,Not a great place to work. Every task generated by computerized expectations and observation by non- corperative entities. Salary evaluations done by inexperienced managers
bad,"The biggest flaw in the store I worked at was communication but it was a flaw that was there at the beginning to the end. I felt this didin't help make the store stronger since we continuously had changes going on all throughout the store seemingly, every other month or so."
bad,"A typical day at work would look like everyone showing up late or calling in ""sick"". Management communication skills were nonexistent and company relationship with employee wasn't there. Everyone seemed to only be there for a paycheck rather than for customer benefit and happiness."
bad,"Management is alright. Don't really listen unless it is a big concern. "
bad,the culture there isn't pleasant. Mangers don't know what their doing.They show favoritism to certain people. they don't treat people equally or fairly. They ride you hard to make production.
bad,come January you will only work 12 hour a week. when they  do get busy they expect you to be there 6 hours7 days a week. manages choose favorites and that's who gets to pick up more hours
bad,"The training was pretty terrible. Not reliable managers at all. If I had something going on for classes or important life situations, managers would give an attitude and expect more from you the next day or when you got back. No chance for advancement at all. Working hard will get you now where here."
bad,"This job kept me fit. At 115 pounds and 4'11 and they had me and ONLY me unloading every single milk delivery, pushing and filling the milk. IF you don't know much about groceries- that's a lot. HR didn't do anything for me. There was a strong guy on our team but he didn't have to do any of that. Not even as a relief for me. I got ripped in those 3 months.That was just the tip of the iceberg. I have a friend in Target in Idaho, seems like it's the same there: lots of gossip and toxic team mates.  "
bad,"When I was there the management was really terrible. I worked at the Starbucks and the team lead there was good, however the target overhead was not. They would constantly forget that their Starbucks was licensed and tried to get my to go over the regional manager for Starbucks. She responded by threatening their license."
bad,"The hierarchical structure of leadership coupled with the glaringly obvious division between leadership and their respective teams is a common theme from location to location. The lack of morale from the team collectively is palpable, due in large part to their leadership team who lookout only for themselves, and passively 'care' about their subordinates when something needs to be accomplished or its t8me for the annual Best Team Survey.  Truly disappointing to be a part of."
bad,Management appears to be more concerned with the bottom line and not employees. Changes in company policy such as reduction in work hours were not explained to front line employees. Employees are reassigned to other work areas with no prior notification and at times without necessary training.
bad,"Target is highly picky when it comes to giving certain employees hours, even if you request to be scheduled more than one day per week, they won't do it if you're a busy college student. "
bad,"In the beginning, I was excited to work there as the store was just opening.  You are hired at minimum wage and as a cashier you are busy. Pay does not compensate with the type of work expected and very little job advancement."
bad,"Working for this company you need tough skin, they don’t care about the employees, they only care about the numbers. It doesn’t matter if you work Harder than anyone else, i was told once by management that the way to move up is to kiss up, and I’ve been seeing all around me. You shouldn’t have to kiss up to move up in a company. A company as big as target shouldn’t make its workers feel like they are worthless. The pay is not that great for the amount of work. Every year after the yearly raise, you get a small 20 cent raise and then they cut your hours."
bad,I worked for the store along with working in pharmacy didn't like working in the store the manager was very unprofessional. The pharmacy was a very nice place to work had great enviroment and very nice people to work for and with
bad,"The night shift is a bad time. Your sleeping schedule gets messed up and its hard to balance while going to school. I had to quit 2 months in because they would refuse to not schedule me on my school days. Overall, not my best job."
bad,"I was promised full time, only to be given 2 days a week 4/5 hours per shift. Who could raise a family working 9 hours a week? Not me, that’s for sure. Maybe they should have actually let the seasonal people go instead of cutting everyone’s hours."
bad,It is an ok place to work as long as you are prepared for covering other people's work. There was a gross amount of favoritism among some workers and management. A lot of people were cut throat and would act one way then another behind your back. I learned to look out for myself and to not trust all management.
bad,"I'm about to quit my job at target because I feel like target doesn't value me in any way. I've had 1 shift a week for months, and even from there they're cutting my hours even though I work hard. I recieve no feedback for my work, no ""good job"" ever and no input on how I could improve. I was not even trained properly! On top of all this I was attacked by a coworker (at work) for being trans, and when I reported him they acted like I was the one who did something wrong! Only upsides are that they give us free food occasionally and most of my coworkers are great people (with a few exceptions)"
bad,"hours never consistent week to week"
bad,"On the surface it seems like Target would be a great place to work.  They talk about it being a team and how they are leaders not managers.  Food is even provided most days in the breakroom.  In reality though they don't care at all about the people that work for them.  The turnover rate is extremly high due to the hostile enviroment that the ""leaders"" in the store have created.  They even set quotas for writing people up, one write up a day.  Not a friendly or caring place to work."
bad,"There is no room for advancement unless you are personally liked by someone higher up. Everyone is out for themselves and you will get thrown under the bus if it helps their cause, no matter if you think you are close with them or not. No one ever addresses actual real concerns in the work place, you can speak but rarely are you ever listened too, and if they do listen they criticize everything you said and make you feel like you are the one in the wrong. There is no motivation to be the best you can be."
bad,"The actual work was easy. Dealing with back stabbing team members, senior team leads and team manager was horrible. I found some team managers found it easier to go around me so they could yell at my team members. Senior team leads are so busy doing the work their team should be doing that they have no clue how to interact with other team leads. In some cases I found that the management strategy was more of a bully mentality with team members. Management skills are either undeveloped or they lack the tools to lead, I'm not sure which was the case."
bad,"I worked here as a seasonal packer, the job goals are unrealistic, you are expected to pack thousands of items even though some things are hard to pack like for instance a pack of nail polishes has the same value as a gigantic cover. They set you up to fail the people that have been there several years never get a chance to advance career wise. It's overall not worth it.oh and the other packers are very rude."
bad,Did not remotely try to work with my preferred scheduling. Forced to do a job I hadn’t applied for. Would not recommend working here unless you don’t mind kissing feet.
bad,"long hours, little rest, lack of coordination and cooperation from management, stress gets to us in different ways, best thing is having time off nd going home after typical eight hour workday"
bad,"Worked for Target for over 4 years in my role as an ETL. I learned a lot, however this is not a job for the faint of heart.  The company culture can be great in green stores. Red store create challenges and depending on your DTL and STL your job will be at risk no matter what your behaviors are."
bad,Target isn't a bad place to work or shop at they do give great assistant and they make sure the customers are always satisfied I can say I like working at target to make the customers satisfied as well
bad,It has been a long time since I worked there so I am unfamiliar with current staff and how it is to work there now. When I was there they did ll they could to keep everyone part time to avoid benefits
bad,"Bosses constantly on your back. During non holiday time, you'll get 12-16 hours only. No chance of full time and no benefits. Good hourly pay, but very few hours."
bad,"Working for Target is an ok job, if your a part time of full time student. Can be fun to work at depending on seasons. Overnight shift can be hard at times if your not an overnight person."
bad,Can be considered good if you need a job.  Management can either be great or horrible. My at first was good then it turned out horrible. Mangers played favorite on who they wanted promoted and would not answer questions about advancement opportunities.
bad,The company has poor training overall and for guests does not use the best marketing techniques on sales. The cartwheel app needs to be easier to use.
bad,"In the beginning days Target is a seemingly fast, fun, and friendly place to work but as time goes on with your employement you'll begin to see acts of favortism and leniency from Team Leads towards certain employees. Good for a short term, perhaps 1to 2 months, employee and experience."
bad,Poor management. Supervisor (team lead) was a poor leader and barely did any work. Did not care at all about work/life balance. Supervisor scheduled hours based on her convenience. Only positive thing is that coworkers were team players and very polite and helpful.
bad,"I switched companies due to lack of team work, inconsistent management, and no time for family life. I worked many shifts that didn't have 8 hours in between."
bad,manager didnt care if family (my children) was visiting from out of town. messed up my tax return address. no job security and would send people home at the door. the people that worked the same position were awesome but management was awful.
bad,"You are constantly being called on your days off to come in because they can't hire anyone competent enough to show up. Management plays favorites and it's very easy to tell, you can't cross train unless you are a favorite and you get less hours if you aren't a favorite. One of the team leads is known to sexually harass team members and HR hasn't done anything about it. Good luck leaving your job at home when you barely have any days off."
bad,"Working for target was a lot like being in high school where the managers are the ""cool kids"" and the coworkers are the ""nerds""."
bad,Expect everyone to kill themselves working even though the upper management just sits around in their offices joking around with each other a lot of the time
bad,"If you're going to work here DO. SALES FLOOR."
bad,Didn't feel like managers cared for employees. Managers are rude to the workers. Felt like managers used workers for their own benefit. Pay wages are not fair.
bad,"Customers are really hard on cashiers here.you are constantly yelled at,things thrown at you,bullied,called names.supervisors care if u get red cards."
bad,"Workplace was inefficient, poorly supported, constant micro-managing from upper management. The only reason I stuck around was that my direct manager (team leader) was a realistic and fantastic woman (and after she has worked for Target for 15 years and is being pushed out)."
bad,The workers worked hard while the boses just nagged the workers and it was just very unprofessional there is only So much a worker can take before they reach there limit and I reached mine.
bad,"When I first arrived at Target I absolutely loved it there. Everyone seemed really nice/genuine and it was a fun place to work. I learned very quickly just how wrong I was. The particular store I was working at was extremely racist and inconsistent when it came to discipline. Only the black team members and leaders at that store were disciplined while everyone else got away with doing the same exact thing time and time again. My direct supervisor issued a corrective action against me for apparently(I did not say it) saying the word ""f*ck"", meanwhile team members, leaders and ETLs(Executive Team Leader) alike constantly cursed every other word, every single day, on the sales floor in front of guests, and in the team member service center as well. Management at this particular store is absolutely atrocious and exceedingly unfair. Target's company policies in general need to be updated or at least fine tuned. Per Target policy, an ETL can simply state that a team member or team leader said something, and based on the ETL statement alone, with absolutely no proof, the ETL can then issue a corrective action against that team member or leader. So, this means that if an executive simply does not like you, they can issue a corrective action against you based on Target policy. This is exactly what happened to me. Also, the integrity hotline is a joke. Target claims that it is a third party company but in reality this company is on Target's side. I called them to file harrassment against my direct supervisor and provided them with over ten examples of how I was or had been harrassed by"
bad,I would not recommend it unless your retired or in school and just need a little extra  not enough to live on at least the store I was at which is closed now
bad,"The Target I worked at was in Shorewood, Illinois. Awful management. Rude, unprofessional managers and Human Resource person. Will gossip about workers on different channels on the walkies. Rudest guests that you'll find in Shorewood."
bad,At first it seemed like an ok place to work for. then after a couple of months everything just changed. and the work environment just became really bad
bad,Targeted turnarounds is fast and brutal. The management team makes you very aware you are disposable. If you only work the holiday season you are better off.
bad,The job wasn't for me. There were to many requirements but the pay was horrible. The raises really didn't mean anything. Some people would get .01 raise. Just sad
bad,Target is ideal for a first starter job or a highschool student in the summer and during the school year. If you have a family of 4 to feed then Target is not the ideal place for you. The pay isn't enough to provide for a large family.
bad,"rushed, learned how to run everything you possible could by working there, management is lazy, not to friendly nothing was hard about the place, the loyal customers were enjoyable to help."
bad,"Very stressful place to work and you never know when you will be the NEXT one to get laid off."
bad,"This was definately my worst job ever, I was never properly trained. Whenever I needed help operating the register in any way management was no where to be found, they tend to just talk and not pay any sort of attention. It was hard especially since I was a minor I was unauthorized t ring up alcohol so i would have to page a manager and they would have to do it, but sometimes it would take so long customers would get very angry with me."
bad,"Not very good at understanding the fact that employees have a life outside of work. The job itself was easy and doable, but the management and the higher-ups were not good people, or were just not good at their job. Target needs to work on it's people skills"
bad,"Worked there over ten years total between two stints.  The longer I was there the more I realized that management didn't know what they were doing for the most part.  The team leads do the majority of the work, and are under paid.  The managers generally come straight out of college with little to no work experience let alone retail experience.  It was really tough to have to teach a supervisor how to do their job when you are below them.  When I started there they rewarded job experience and loyalty, now they reward people with bachelors degrees, and no experience.   Also no hours."
bad,"Hit the floor running and expect to have unreasonable goals pushed upon you constantly. Short staffed, schedules not as promised upon hire, full-time hours varied from 40 - 24 hours per week. Power struggle among management and mixed messages and demands from all. Ask the same question of four managers and get four different answers. Some co-workers became good friends."
bad,"I felt they didn't respect a lot of employees, and they didn't sufficiently train employees when they had expected very high standards.  If employees didn't meet their requirements they would get scolded at the end of each shift."
bad,"If you're a student looking for a job to get some extra money that will work easily with your hours, then Target is for you. If you're old and you don't have a career and are looking for a place to work at that you don't have to do much at, then Target is for you. Anyone else? Just go somewhere else. Start a career somewhere more solid where you're actually respected by your managers and coworkers."
bad,"Overall the management is poor. Terrible communication and very unfair, in regards to the lack of understanding outside work conditions. You are provided sick  time, yet you get scolded and coached when you need to use it."
bad,Although it may not be the same for all targets the one I've worked at has managers with very poor managing skills. Team members are not properly trained and are just thrown in departments leaving the more experienced team members to train them and do their already VERY FULL WORK LOAD. managers are unapproachable when it comes to these situations. They can be flexible. I do enjoy being there with my team leads and co workers.
bad,"Target could have been the best Retailer to work for if they stuck to their own policy of not training a new employee in the store where they were going to be permanently placed. This is a good policy because it would mean that you would be taking the job of your trainer.  Well they did not do this with me and they offered me the job of the person who trained me and tried to send her to another store, needless to say she resisted and they moved her to another department and it was a horrible outcome."
bad,The hardest part of working at target is working with slackers on the sales floor. Also it is very easy to lose their job over someone else's work performance.
bad,"I have been trained to unload trucks, back stock, price change, POG team, and cashier. I enjoy the people I work with but the management is not up to the high standers they should be."
bad,"Otherwise, don't bother. The location at which I worked and during the time that I did, the manager was absolutely awful. Unfortunately I'm not the only one who thought so."
bad,"typical day have to work without proper equipment to assist guest or just set salesplanners, back stock, pull freight with.  Some management are good others are horrible and sit on there rears in the breakroom most of the shift.  I worked with a great team of coworkers on the same level as me.  Team players we showed them how great of a team we were but they still cut your hours. I learned that this company should only be PT. Hardest part can not live off the pay/hours."
bad,Not many supervisors willing to train properly and not much opportunity to move up in the company.  They advertise competitive pay but they only pay minimum wage upon entry.
bad,"...with some really good people at all levels."
bad,Target is a good place to start a career and learn the ropes of a given area of business. Just keep in mind that you're better off moving on do a different company than waiting for a promotion
bad,The push for red cards is understandable as it's apart of a sell within the job but it shouldn't be a reason for a person to be terminated (not the reason for my separation) but it's a decent company I'll rather go corporate if I do go back or was to recommend
bad,"Target once was a wonderful company to work for. You worked hard, were recognized for your hard work and contributions. You were a part of a team that wanted the company to thrive. Now, the goal is to reduce full time employees. They schedule a skeletal team of employees, and call you in the event that one of the newly hired part time employees didn't show up for work. If you're willing to part time (on call)... this is the job for you!"
bad,"Typical day at target, would allow me to come in around 4:00 am in the morning to clock in.  Once I have clocked in, then i would proceed to the back area where the truck is located and begin to setup to unload it.  Once we spend a few hours unloading the truck to the floor, I would then spend the rest of the 4-5 hours i have been scheduled placing the product on shelves and deposing the boxes to the back all while taking care of customers needs and answering phones at the same time."
bad,Advancement wasn't based on your knowledge just who you're friends with.  Bad moral!!  If your young and just want to hang out this is the job for you.
bad,Ultimately had to leave because I'd aged out of my parents insurance and was offered full time elsewhere. I'm not 100 percent sure but I don't think the location I worked at had any full time employees.
bad,"This job was a dead end, I was laid off shortly after being promoted to no fault of my own. Raises were inconsistent, and as empty as the promise of a competitive wage and scaling pay. Avoid at all costs, unless you plan on working here for a very short amount of time"
bad,Poor training and lack of respect.you may find a few decent mangers but the ETLs veiw employees as numbers and to many of them do not take their jobs seriously
bad,"Good first job and experience for younger employees. Bad for pretty much anything else, but that's to be expected from a retail job. Fred Myers is a better retail employer"
bad,"For some people, it could be the perfect job. A lot of my coworkers are very nice, and do a great job. However, many workers aren't treated properly. I have asthma and get sick/injured easily, and I'm told that everyone understands that I can't do the same work as others, yet I get reprimanded for not working fast enough or the same as others, and I'm told I can't have a bad day ever."
bad,"I loved working for Target until they started outsourcing their jobs to India.  I watched as every co-worker that had over 15 years with the company had their jobs eliminated.  All the management cared about was that the costs had to be lowered and they were paying these long-term workers twice as much as they would a new hire, so they re-structured the division.  Management eventually had karma come back at them when in the end when they too were laid off."
bad,During my time at Target I experienced poor management with regard to communicating the changes being made to the schedule and assignments for each employee
bad,Management was horrible. they didn't have anything originated. they would change the schedule and not warn anyone their hours have changed. Store was unorganized all together
bad,It's an ok place to work. The co-workers are not friendly. The hours are terrible. You work long hours sometimes and don't get any appreciation for taking the initiative to stay and help extra hours or to come in when they need extra help on your days off.
bad,Target was good until the new management came that why I left they can do much better and need the improve on that and how they treat their workers on a daily .
bad,I am a hard worker and Target took advantage of that. I have not been fairly compensated and have been often asked to do my job in addition to the jobs of people that get paid more than myself.
bad,I did not like working for Target warehouse almost every day there were times when there was no work and since they ran out of work we had to be sweeping for 3/4 hours a night.  they were very unorganized and would not let us know that our schedule was changed until we 3rgot to work that night.
bad,Its a ok place to work. Its long hours and you are standing on concrete for 12 hours a day with only two breaks. They have a quote of how much you need to do in a day.
bad,"A typical day at work is having a meeting. Talking to guest over the phone, responding to emails and learning more about the company. You learn how to respond to guest and you learn all of the rules about Target. Co workers at the job are great and lots of help. The hardest part of the job is speaking with management about what to do and not to do. The most enjoyable thing about the job is getting paid."
bad,Target needs better LODS and some managers that actually care about there workers some of the managers don't care about other people's problems or needs they should really get on them about that it's not helpful to any of the workers.
bad,"When they were stationed in Canada I  personally felt like they weren't tryin to get to know there customer base, I also felt like they struggled to keep up with the other stores in thier category. But over all it was a good experience and I am happy for the opportunity."
bad,"Don't work here upper management dies not like to promote older people. They want fresh off the street college kids to run their stores. They cut hours all the time and it makes it really hard to live off of. Upper management sucks. HR is a revolving door of gossip, nothing is kept secret. The discount isn't even worth it it's only 10%."
bad,"Unhappy employees, work managers like a crazy person.  There is no work life balance. Everyone hated working for the company, the Store manager didn't know anything about his role or anything about the company and basically winged it out.  It was a bad experience."
bad,"its like high school. theres cliques, gossip, drama, and bullying. i tried to make a formal harrasement complaint and request to not work with that person anymore and i was more or less told i was wrong and they didnt take me seriously. some of the people here are genuinely good, but majority of the managers talk bad about you behind your back, try to get you in trouble, or act like theyre 16."
bad,"Team leads manage all aspects of the store, Management has to communicate with Team leads to make decisions, Management does not acknowledge appropriate team members for achievements."
bad,"Don't be surprised if you show up for work and get send back home because the truck got canceled or have to just leave yourself because nobody in management showed up to open the doors. "
bad,good work space.good colleagues and timings was also good.learned  many things from the seniors and started my carrier from the same company
bad,The job is fun and fast paced. The management sucks overall at the store I was at but not all stores are the same. The pay is okay and the hours are unpredictable. Sometimes you get 30 hours and the next week you get 14 hours.
bad,"It is a fast working paced job. I learned that you need you watch out and make friends with everyone or you have no chance of going anywhere in this job. Management are childeren that dont know how to manage time and work load between their employees and relie on pushing the hard working employees to get jobs done."
bad,"Fast paced, fun environment. Interacting with customers daily and making sure complete satisfaction with every interaction, challenging but worth while. Management was not approachable and much favoritism was witnessed towards employees."
bad,"A typical day at work:"
bad,Target is a bunch of bs. You get a lot of hours when its a holiday but after that be ready for a big cut on hours.And when I say big I mean big you could be scheduled for as little as 5 hours a week. Now they might try to say you can pick up hours but that's a lot of bull they are the hours that no one wants. They also call you in at the last moment so you never really can plan anytbing . They will call you in but you can never ask them fro hours cause they won't give it to you so don't waste your breath. Now there's even an pay gap for those who works day than the night shift.  They day side team members make 9.00$ an hr while the night gets 10.50$ hr now I'm not saying that night shift doesn't deserve that day side have to deal with peoples attitude so we should make the same. Now if you work day side your in for some real bs now day side is  from early morning until target close then it switch over to over night. Any way back to day side they expect you to do your job an go up if they need more cashiers. Keep in mind you only have so many hours an you can be up cashiering for an couple of hours. So when your job isn't done your team lead gets upset at you. Basically I can go on an on about target but I won't so I'm going to sum it up. Target has a lot of great people that works there an you'll find some friends there but that's about it . they don't care about their employees because they are always hiring. I say if you need to work there get what you can out of it an find a better job .Target likes to play like its better than Walmart but somehow Walmart employees get paid
bad,if you are not the favorite or the butt kisser then you dont get hours. i learned that people are miserable in their life long careers and that most management in retail are very miserable. co-workers where nice and the hardest part was how nasty people are just because they know they can be. the most enjoyable part was meeting people that you see come in the store often and being very helpful to people that want or need help.
bad,"Saratoga target, where to start... The store is a circus. The job environment, is what you would expect; fast paced retail, smug cranky customers and useless management. While some of the other employees are great, the ringleaders are incompetent and 80% of the workforce here is high school kids that don't show up for their shifts. I got hired full time for Starbucks and the hours were terrible. They roped me in around the holidays promising full time and couldn't deliver I was used to cover the busiest weekend shifts with no help or break coverage half the time I would stay all day because no one shows up for their shift. If you call in or no call no show, there is no consequences here. people blow off work all week and still have jobs. Management forgot to schedule me for an entire week and that was supposedly my training week for Starbucks, instead of fixing the schedule they threw me on as a cashier and then threw me to the wolves to learn how to close the Starbucks with no training on the weekend before xmas. "
bad,"target hires you for one position and then wants you to work multiple positions that you aren't compensated for. they ask you to do everything and then when holiday hrs are over you go from 30-40 hrs every week to 15 hrs a week. its cool if you live at home with your family and dont have real bills but if you do, this isnt the job for you. you cant live off the ups and downs of retail, its just not stable."
bad,"All positions are part-time unless in management. They hate to pay over-time. Bombarded with many tasks that must be completed quickly. Short hour scheduled shifts which makes it impossible to do a thorough job. You learn to cut corners to please micro-managing managers who tend to spend more time chatting with each other and walking the sales floor doing very little. This is a temporary job to get to point A to B. Good for high school and college students who need something to do. You do learn good customer service skills as there are many different personality of coworkers, customers and management. You learn to adapt fast and deal or quit. Short breaks and lunches that are mandatory which often conflict with your work you have to finish. I would say if you are looking for short term gig, go for it but don't stress yourself out over Target. It's not as happy as the commercials."
bad,This job is not for everyone. the communication is horrible and a very racist place to work. It truly became all about the money. These people don't care for your well being
bad,they held back alot of hours. and never schedule enough employees to get the job done. they put alot of strain on one employee to do a whole dept. unfair. and the raises we not good at all
bad,I've worked for Target twice in the last five years in two different states. The job itself is easy but the management continually makes things harder. They impose rules seemingly at the drop of a hat. It becomes a difficult environment because it makes it hard to keep up.
bad,"My day starts with stocking shelves, and when the store opens I also greet and assist customers.  I really don't know much about management, they don't seem to make themselves available, though i do like the team leaders.  My co workers are friendly and helpful.  I enjoy stocking shelves and greeting and assisting customers."
bad,"I arguably worked at one of the worst run stores in the district and I've been told it's improved greatly, but my experience was terrible. I was there long enough to be proficient at my job but was still treated like I was incompetent by managers who were hired from outside the company with very little experience or understanding of what I was actually responsible for. At one point I was called in by a new store manager and he said he wanted me to be a manager I expressed an interest and then the position was promptly filled by an outside hire."
bad,"I would go in sort out shipments, then stock the store. Always a chance of getting to work the register or floor. It was a fun environment, my coworkers were fantastic. The company treated it's people well. The worst part was lack of hours. The best part it was a fun job. Something you didn't mind getting up for."
bad,I am the Manager of the Starbucks within my Target location. I was named as the Starbucks Manager for the 3rd quarter in 2015.
bad,"Target was a decent place to work several years ago, but then they started cutting half the sales floor positions and required everyone that isn't an ETL to double their workload without an increase in pay. You're also expected to do the work of 2 people in the amount of time it would actually take 3 people to do the job correctly. Then they will use the fact that the job tasks are impossible to compete correctly (and in a timely manner) against you in your reviews, or if they don't like you to ""performance"" you out. That's what they've been doing to elderly workers that have maxed out on their pay and have good benefits. Target doesn't want to pay them anymore so they use their impossible metrics to force them out regardless if they're doing a good job or not."
bad,There is no chance for promotion internally. You will have to constantly back up cashier and do other other teams work while expected to finish your own. All the while others get to go home on time while my team has to stay until the job is finished. Would not recommend to anyone
bad,"Management is unprofessional and talks about employees behind their back.  Horrendously understaffed.  Hours are not true.  Could be  scheduled to work until 23:00.  But, might be there until 02:00 in the morning."
bad,"i liked working at target the first few years but after they got new management i started not wanting to come there that often. a typical day at work was coming to work, picking up re shop at the front, heading to the fitting room to sort the re-shop, then putting up backrooms re-shop, helping out with the front lanes, going on lunch, covering a department for their break or lunch then getting started on my zone."
bad,"Working under high pressure and speed, taking care of clients. I´ve improved my english. Nice managment and good co-workers. The hardest part the speed and some clients. Anyway you need to smile."
bad,"It was a really easy job. Stock shelves, help people find things, back up cashier when needed. Co-workers were awesome for the most part but huge disconnect between most managers and crew members.Overtime was a no-no. You were expected to be everywhere at the same time."
bad,I did not like working for target they where very unorganized and you never got off on time. They would have you doing everything at one time and if you do not finish your job because of having to do other assigned task you will get in trouble for that.
bad,I was added on as part-time seasonal and worked full-time hours. Rarely had time to do homework or study because of the late hours and last minute schedule changes. Managers are nice but there are some that seem to not care. There was always something that I wasn't doing right. Left because I did not enjoy working there.
bad,"The co-workers here was very friendly and easy going. If you just started employment there, they showed you the ropes and let you know what needs to be done and whose to go to when help is needed."
bad,Target is a fast paste job. The people I worked with varied in ethnicity.The job is very detailed and heavy duty. There is a lot of bending and lifting.
bad,"Poor management, horrible pay/hours, stressful environment, and weak training. Basically the only good part about working here is some of the people you might meet. As most of the team members say about how Target treats the employee's ""Expect more out of you, while paying you less."""
bad,"While working for Target Canada, it has been noted that many of the team leaders have either quit or not done a up to par job at running the store. There tends to be a lack of communication between different department and management as well. On a typical day there is usually multiple directions given and no one knows where to go or what to do. target would definitely not be a life career choice to say the least."
bad,Target is a terrible place to work. There is a lot of favoritism and management is horrible. I've been there for over 6 years and my pay rate is 9.56. There is no room for advancement and the yearly raises suck.
bad,Very busy around the holidays. Was a learning experience that was beneficial to me. Interacted with people of all races.
bad,"Awful place to work honestly.  The coworkers are wonderful but the management SUCKS! They act like they care about the well being of their employees but they don't.  Many times they didn't want to do their job so we had to answer to rude guests when they didn't feel like dealing with them. Way too much work for little pay. Not all ""leaders"" knew how to talk to those in a lower position than them. Way too much petty drama amongst leaders and too many call offs."
bad,The workplace is very different considering thats its downtown seattle and that its one of the only stores that carry almost anything in down town.
bad,Days would start at 4am with truck unload. Then stock would be moved to sales floor and placed on shelves. Any extra stock would then be moved to stock room and stored. The enjoyable part of the job were the people i worked with. We all found ways to make the job more enjoyable while being productive with our work. The hardest part of the job was the hours and the toll it took on family life.
bad,"I enjoyed working with my-coworkers, although I was only part-time, and required full time employment. They gave me excellent training on the cash register."
bad,"typical day for me was ok very high pace , hardest part of the job working softlnes i feel the company needs to pay there employees  more for the time and effort they spend during a work shift."
bad,"If you want to make a living and be responsible, do not work for this company, they are so cheap, it is not even funny anymore"
bad,L'aspect le plus agréable de mon poste a été le recrutement et la santé et sécurité.
bad,"You will start on minimum wage and get between 4 and 30 hours per week. Some days you will start at 3am."
bad,"Go to assigned area, Do tasks that were required.Help guests by going up to them and asking if they needed help as well as finishing tasks."
bad,They'll put you in departments you know nothing about and have no training in and will refuse to help you or answer questions. The pay is nowhere near enough to deal with the verbal abuse from the LOD's.
bad,"typical day would be early mornings, busy, very awesome personal relationships with guests. "
bad,"Typical work day was hard work "
bad,"Fun Place to Work"
bad,"Most of the mangers are horrible people who care only about the businesses and not the individual. The Other Team Members are wonderful and always willing to help. The culture in the store is BAD no one is happy everyone complains. its not a good place and its hard to be fun, fast, and friendly when everyone around you is miserable."
bad,empresa ainda estava em crescimento com muita coisa para mudar e poucos clientes e material para fazer
bad,"Typical day at Target go to the line to grab a pull. auto-fills help guest ,zone and pick up around the store. do cashier back up. What I learned at target how to work has a team . management was ok. co-works great. the hardest part of my job never having help in the fitting room, cashier, floor . the most enjoyable part of my job was the people."
bad,More of a door greeter position. Was expecting more Loss Prevention work.
bad,"The work is not bad, the guests are awesome.. but Team Leads and Leaders on duty suck. They do not know how to talk to people and most of them are on some sort of ""power trip."" "
bad,fast fun friendly service. some managers were not all that nice. no advancement at all
bad,"You start off checking in with managment to talk about numbers and the expectaion for the day. You touch base with your team throughout the day to talk with them about their goals for the day. You motivate them by having contests and talking about a good experience they may have had with a guest. The hardest part of the job is that you are on your feet all day. They most enjoyable part is you are always helping people, whether it be your staff or the guests."
bad,start at 6am complete the pulls in 1:30hr (50-58 lists) and push the pulls for the rest of the shift. Annnnnnnd if you really do well you will get your hours cut and switched from 10pm (night shift) to 4am (f@%#ed up shift) and then to 6am.  You will have lost so much pride and self confidence if you stay there more than 6 months.
bad,"micro management , it gets annoying , good for students. not advancement in the company. use this job as a stepping stone and move on."
bad,"there are many positions at the supercenter, but the cart attendant was te lowest paid and the most worked. we were responsible of carts for a 1 mile radious, trash, sanitation of facilities, sales and casheir."
bad,"Their concern is putting a good public face on and forget that the workers are not robots. They are people, with families and emotion."
bad,"I enjoy my coworkers. I have learned many things about the food service industry with regards to Food Safety, and best practices within a food service environment."
bad,They are the worst mangers they don't care about anything but credit app.
bad,"I learned that working here and staying here should not be a goal. Unless you are in a manager/supervisor position it is pointless. The managers do not appreciate you, they overwork you, and show no recognition for hard work."
bad,"Inflexibility with hours, unethical attitude toward employees' union options."
bad,"At first, Target seemed to be a great new company for someone looking for a retail job. Good hours, friendly co-workers and knowledgeable management. "
bad,"From a security perspective, I have no idea how this company is even compliant with any regulations. Shame on management and the IT director who turned the working environment into his personal dating site."
bad,"The day to day was pretty  much the same, I enjoyed working the graveyard shift. The hardest part of the job was climbing the ladders. The most enjoyable part of working there was the routine. I thrive on routine."
bad,Did not enjoy working for this company no room for advancment at all.
bad,Get to work clock in unload truck or start stocking the back room or pull for sales floor there not really organized and management was poor the only person that understood any thing was team leader T. she was kool had no time to assosiate with other team members but when we did was to only help stock or do a buddy system the best time about the job was completing the stock before the time limit was up on it
bad,"We unload the truck and try to get a 60 minute unload ."
bad,ETL's don't set the proper examples as a leader. Lunches are always short  but I always see ETL's eating and using cellphones all day which isn't a good look to me. Team members know way more than the supervisors
bad,"There was lack of good management skills...(communication). There was not enough hours or resources for the workloads given, and favoritism."
bad,"I worked as a seasonal flow team member, the work was generally easy just restock the products on the shelves from the pallets but sometimes was impossible to finish before the end of my shift when the truck had many pieces to unload and restock, also you must provide your own gloves when they send you to restock pfresh(frozen foods)."
bad,"I enjoy the fast pace of working there and the majority of the employees were friendly and helpful. It was nice to be warmly welcomed. There were many things that need improvement for the health/welfare and safety/security for their employees. I have worked retail for many years and was surprised by the lack of concern or care for certain things there."
bad,target is a good place to work because of the team members but when it comes to the management they really do suck. They say that they will work with worker and there availability but they don't really do and still schedule you during a time and day that you are not able to work. There isn't any communication between the managers whom tells the other employees what needs to be done and the managers seems to want to look down on the workers at all times.
bad,"fast paced and offer little room to move up.the pay is not competitive and you work rain,sleet,shine,or snow.Management does little to help people in need or when it comes to advancing"
bad,"fun workplace, but low pay, hours get cut when the store doesn't make sales"
bad,"unloaded the truck"
bad,Better organizational skills inside the company is needed.  Safety needs to be addressed more.
bad,"Fast, friendly"
bad,"Pulled stock from back room shelves, loaded onto carts or pallet jacks and took to sales floor for another team to put on customer shelves. Backstocked excess."
bad,"The management does not value the employees or the customers. Everyone is replaceable, and the resulting atmosphere is negative and highly stressful."
bad,"the day always starts off with opening the gate getting the drop off counter and handing out prescriptions. then you go to the back and start typing, filling, making your work place a clean as can be before the rush. getting inventory for tomorrow done, and calling insurance's claims that didn't go through.I was a cashier before I started in the pharmacy I've learned a lot just from being in that different kinda of field. Hardest part was when rush hour came and the flu shots was in season but with the right planning it was perfect. the management never took responsibly for there actions and always blamed it on us and showed favoritism to other coworkers. being my role of a pharmacy technician was the best part of my day and every day"
bad," Target systems never work as intended, causing the team to work around it in incredibly inefficient eays so as not to get red scores. Staffing is also a joke as when listing ones availability, they will schedule over it regardless. STL Store team lead is dogmatic and incapable of reason. It is done his way, regardless if it is right. He is incapable of apologizing when wrong, and argues his point endlessly without regard for the other persons point. His inappropriate jokes are a sad attempt to be social when they are almost always degrading. No one can respond to his face as he is the STL. I would never recommend working there."
bad,A work at target was always busy. i learned how stay tidy and how to help others. The job bosses were okay but could always been better. The co-workers were fun and always happy. The hardest part of the  of the job was doing my job and the lazy workers job as well. I loved to help people and learned to love helping the lazy people that worked on the job.
bad,"Most people that were in this work environment were unable to hold a conversation, it was a huge drag. Everyone around me were regular drug users, and since I do not personally partake in recreational drug use, there was nothing to talk about."
bad,"The benefit from exployment with Target were my Guest. I built a Very High Cliental of Guest, that would actually wait at my register line for an exceeding time, for Me to Service them. My Conversions were Always at a very High rate. Conversions at Target are to Sale Red Cards to the Guest, for an additional 5% off of Every purchase, Every Trip to Target. My Sales qualifications, match up to my Excellent Customer Service skills. Overall, Target Corp. does not pay their Team Members wages to benefit the High Cost of Living this day and time. Due to the wages, and Management non communication, I could see no Future to even Advance when opportunity was there. However, the time with Target built my People Skills Tremendously."
bad,"A typical day at work was a 3 or 4 hour shift of doing nothing but standing around and talking to other employees that were not busy. The company did not get a lot of customers so we were never really busy but when we were I would get excited because then I could interact with the customers and I love doing that. I didn't really learn a lot from working there other then that if I am ever in management I should not do a lot of things that the management team was doing over there. Everything I had already known about working in retail applied there so I there wasn't a lot to learn. My co-workers were very nice people but they always complained about being at work, they never showed happiness being at work and working with customers. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep busy when there were no customers in the store with nothing to do, I do not like to just stand around. The most enjoyable part of the job was, as I stated before, helping the customers"
bad,A day at target wasn't bad outside the terrible shift I worked.
bad,"Keep working. no time for social activity. Management is incompetent and don't listen. Not very diversified and the fast, fun and friendly culture is a myth."
bad,"Working at Target has given me some great experience in sales but the management entirely was poor & the employee's weren't as nice as I expected, but overall I enjoyed the opportunity that they gave me of achieving a job at that time."
bad,A fast paced environment where you are constantly working with the public. You tend to keep very busy which makes the day go by quickly but it can also be very tiring.
bad,Overall my experience was ok but the raises could have been more.
bad,Culture & Values are ok ... no scope & growth for EAs. Good Co-workers;
bad,waiting on customer ringing them out. I already knew how to do the job so didnt learn anything new. Management was 2 faced would tell you one thing then do something different. My co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part was the hours and it was boring to me. The most enjoyable part was that I got to deal with customers and be able to help them with their needs.
bad,"as far as the job is concerned the work was not too difficult, but the management and HR made working for this company terrible"
bad,not a positive place to be no veteran management no room for advancement.very depressing place to be
bad,"A typical day working at target was management taking their problems out on employee's. Someone stealing something and security lets them get away with it. I learned patience with this job. Also the employee's were very rude and the pay was not worth it. When I had to move they would not relocate me. The HR lady was very unprofessional. My most enjoyable part of working there, was the customers. They were always so nice and when I did get an unpleased customer, I always resolved the problem."
bad,"When I was hired, I disclosed all of my health conditions. I was told that ""everything was ok and workable"". Once I began working, however, it was another story. I was harassed and ridiculed by my superiors on a weekly basis for 5 years. I was forced to PROVE my conditions to one supervisor (not my supervisor) by showing her ALL of my prescriptions and doctor's evaluations, which is illegal. I was ""hit on"" by a male supervisor and when I rejected his advances and placed a complaint, I experienced retaliation. He was never disciplined. I was never properly trained for my position, nor were 80% of the other team members. The upper management actively ""forces out"" higher paid and older team members so they can be replaced with people that cost the company less. Upper managment will also lie to you about promotions to get you to sign on with the company and then claim they ""had no idea policy had changed"". The only nice thing about the company is all of the team building events they have- except for those of us that have to plan said events only to have 50% of the team complain about some aspect of it (Example- I was threatened by a coworker because I didn't requisition his favorite soda). Seriously. Who whines about FREE FUN?"
bad,what I do on a regular basis consists of communicating with and assisting the public as well as organizing store stock
bad,"not good place to work,not good enviroment. The management is not pro employe"
bad,"If you like short work week hours and lots of micro management, then this is the company for you. If you want promotional opportunities the get ready for disappointing results. The company was good to their employees but they years have past that is going to happen. I know of at least 8 employees in my district that have been fired over things such as not completing paper work or not being a team player and they were all seasoned ( over 10 yrs) employees. They company asks that you give 300% and then that is not enough. You are required to complete task, give good customer service, help other departments, clean up after customers( who don't care) while you are the only one scheduled in your department. Retail is HARD work."
bad,like working at target in the begining but quickly turned bad it is who you know not what you know
bad,"I don't really like this job i just do it because i need money to pay bills. Target is ok, they ask you to do so much at one time. Guest traffic is the worst especially on weekends. The only things good are the request time off whenever you feel like it and events where they buy food and drinks."
bad,"I was a seasonal employee for target. During one month I had over 80 Target Credit card applications ran (more than double the rest of the store combined). I sold the first ever home install on a tv for that store. I had great product knowledge and completed all my work. At the end of the Christmas period, they didn't even tell me I was being let go they just stopped scheduling me. When I asked them about it, they offered my 10 hours a week as a cashier. What a load of junk! I took that stores electronics department from dead last out of 11 to 4th in a month. They were number 1 in credit cards because of me. Don't work for the one in Barboursville, WV!"
bad,Hired on as a team lead while in grad school. Once graduated Target didn't care. Unless you are hired as an ETL - which means you have to be some 22 year old with no common sense - you will never move up.
bad,"Not a very good place to work, wonderful place to shop. Repeatative work. Management not looking for future team members. Co-workers enthusiasm very low. Standing for long periods of the day very tiresime."
bad,The management was horible and rude. They are not a good company to work for.
bad,"This particular store was unorganized. There would be days when I had no idea which department I was assigned to (Maybe this was due to employee call outs). Also there were times where I would be put in a large department by myself and be expected to keep it tidy and clean which was stressful. Management was okay I guess, but really did not have much interaction with them. My co-workers were awesome and kept me going through the day. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers especially around the holiday. Not sure if I had an enjoyable moment at this job it was pretty cut and dry."
bad,"A typical day of work for me is to, push products onto the shelves and assist guest when they need help. I mainly work 12pm-8:30pm five days a week. When starting work I am unable to get equipment until the morning team leaves, which is around 2:30- 3:00pm."
bad,It's always busy at Target Store. I always have my daily routines to get the job done in a timely manner. I always manage my executions at the return department to provide customer service. I have learned to maximized my productivity to stay in stock. I have 10 years of experienced working for this company. Management are not very knowledgeable in most areas of the store. Lack of recognition for those worker who been there for a long time and knows how to value their work. Lack of work ethic and not very helpful to their employee. It's very stressful and not very fun to work here after a while. I love working with my co - workers who become a friend to me. The hardest part of this job was not getting any recognition from the management.
bad,On a good work day you might be able to get half of what you should done. Managment is about as useless as you can get. The co-workers are alright if there not trying to tell on eachother just to get in a postion to maybe move up. The hardest part of the job is trying to get more hours. the enjoyable part is knowing that the project you started is done it looks really good.
bad,"I have learned that target corporation is discriminate against women with high risk pregnancy restrictions. They did not want to follow my doctor's orders, so they terminated me and made it seem as though I did not do my job correctly. Highly disappointed in the company and would NOT go back."
bad,"working at target is an exhausting experience. constantly have to stay, management getting upset with you whether you do right or wrong. contacting them is not good when you are sick, hard to get in touch with anyone."
bad,"The store i was at(1481), had a manager that made a point of getting rid of the older associates. He had his circle and if you weren't in it, you are in a bad position."
bad,"A disgusting amount of work for not enough money, promised $15 in 2020."
bad,"I can’t say anything negative enough about this company. There are many individuals who I greatly enjoyed leadi and working with, but make no mistake this company is the exact opposite of the image they put out. The pay is the only positive!"
bad,I don’t know how a company like this is still up for how they treat cashiers and outside cart people and also the maintenance workers.. i had to stay and get every cart from the parking lot by myself while everyone else went home. It was 30 degrees outside in North Carolina.
bad,"awful job, awful hours, awful pay."
bad,There is no work life balance at Target.  The management does not make you feel like you a part of the team.  The opportunity for advancement is small and there is hardly any ability to trust your superior
bad,"I have worked at Target for quite a while and it has turned into one of my worst jobs very fast. Working here I have been cut short of hours, down to one day a week, without a single care from management. The management at Target is at best subpar, the main team lead is rude, in thoughtful, and downright unfit for his job. At Target they ignore your availability as much as possible and even when you ask for your times to be switched, they make you feel obligated to still work outside of your availability and sometimes don’t change your scheduled time and simply ignore your request. At Target I have also been constantly pushed to change my availability and told multiple times that it’s “awful” and “bad” (my availability is days during the weekends and nights during the week) and that is the same reasoning I get when I ask for more hours because I cannot live off of working one day per week. Target is not a place to work because they only put on an act that they care for their employees but at the end of the day they don’t. Target management in my opinion should be kicked out and replaced."
bad,"Target has a great reputation in the community but not when you are an actual employee. Not sure if its universal or based on which store you work for. Good for seasonal work, not career growth."
bad,Working at target was an experience. When I was hired I had applied for style and tech but during my hiring process my lead wanted me to work in fulfillment so I did but as I stayed there it was only seasonal but when the lead saw I was struggling instead of telling me how to be better he decided to end my season early by a month and a half but said it was because of hours. Of course I asked around and the people hired the same day as me looked puzzled when I asked if there season was cut. I felt hurt and disrespected why couldn’t they be honest with me instead of just lying to me .
bad,"Expect to make less than 60 hours every two weeks. Their budget doesn't allow for employees to make a living wage. But what’s worse is how hilariously understaffed they will have the store even on the busiest nights, leaving the sales associates to not only tend to guests in their areas and restock shelves, but tend to every adjacent area around them, sometimes running across the store to the many ”Call Buttons” scattered throughout the store for the guest’s convenience. Do not work here if you want a stable comfortable job"
bad,"They pull you in during the interview process telling you that it's a fun, ""fast-paced"" job. It isn't. Do not be fooled. It is retail. There is almost no room for advancement because only friends get brought to the top. My sister has been working at one location for 3 years and keeps being led on about becoming a team-lead for over a year. Managers micromanage daily and pretend to be on your side. The schedule was incorrectly made for me multiple times. It was a seasonal position and they didn't let me know if I was hired until the last week possible. Afterward, they started cutting my hours every week until I couldn't afford to work there anymore and had no choice but to quit. Also, I go in trouble because they scheduled me on veterans (one of two in the entire store) day and I called out."
bad,Worked Night shift for target as my first real job. you'll be worked hard and need to be able to keep up. Depends on whether or not you don't anger your managers. if you keep it longer then the holiday rush. Which I unfortunately didn't.
bad,"My personal business always leaked out to other team members,  through management. They come off caring, but the moment you are faced with a challenge they forget all about you."
bad,"I had worked at Target before for Seasonal, they never keep you after the first couple weeks of Jan. this time the training was 3hrs with an employee that had her own work to do plus trying to train a new employee. then they don't schedule you again for a week to 10 days and expect you to remember what you were told!!.the scanning guns never worked half the time and it cut into your productivity, which they judged you on in the first couple of days of employment! Items weren't in the right locations, management told you to hunt down someone working in that dept to help you! not enough walkies for all the employees. one of the managers got upset with me because I left my cart for a couple of mins which I was standing right next to it. She said follow me and walked me to the office and let me go!! said it wasn't working out! they hire their seasonals too late in the season and don't train long enough because of that reason! The Management, Leads, and managers don't even know what they are doing and stressed out all the time! I like the store but the Corporate offices need to get the training up to par instead of just the facelift they did to the Stores! very disappointed in this Company this time around!! and the Dress Code is Terrible!! you can't tell the employees from the customers anymore!!! Sad!"
bad,"I was so excited about working at Target, but the work environment was horribly hostile! Management and the visual merchandiser harrassed people daily! The store I was at had no store manager for a while and the team leads were playing as if mommy and daddy had left them home alone! No kind of management at all. They were behind on everything! Even during the holidays, everything hit the sale floor late. The visual merchandiser walked around talking and laughing all day holding shelves as if she was working. She was always ordering others to do her VMG's and resets! Then! Once the store manager arrived, she made it worse with her bullying and threats! It wasn't the worker's fault that everything was f*^%k up & stuff! There was only one professional team lead and two that actually worked. Everyone else laughed, played and drank Starbucks all day! The worst experience working in retail I ever had. I don't think all Targets operate this way, but we were clearly overworked, told to do jobs that were not our responsibility and bullied! You are supposed to be an expert in your department, but you never knew what you had to do with each day. Every day was something different!  I was a sales associate, but I did resets, VMGs and all making a salary of a sales associate. They also changed the schedule without notice! So you would come in following the schedule that you had, but would be unable to clock in because someone in personal changed it and didn't notify you that the schedule has been changed!"
bad,"Managers expect you to do the work of multiple people, often make hurtful comments, and almost never take initiative themselves, very unprofessional work environment"
bad,okay place to work after high school or part time... nothing else. hours come and go so do not expect set hours unfortunately. pay could be way better.
bad,A typical work day was filled with poor management. The work culture is amazing amongst co-workers because everyone would bond over how ridiculous target management was. Management has no consideration for family emergencies or any outside life. They made no effort to update work availability and management would make no effort to get to know you as a human being.
bad,Fails to promote good hard working employees. Instead hires straight from college with no retail experience. Offers higher pay but only provides low hours.
bad,"Can be ok depending on dept and if your team and leader all work equally. Pay definitely needs to be a bit higher for all the work you do, but overall not the worst job you can have."
bad,Very poor management.  Store is dirty.  Too many young irresponsible and unreliable employees.  No professionalism.  Poorly trained employees.  Very negative work environment.
bad,"Target is only good for people with no kids and without big responsibilities in life. If you are grown especially with kids and you only a Team lead or anything other than a store director(Target should not be your main money to survive with), The leads, store director and executives do not know what they are doing and I am surprised the small fries really kiss up to them. The backroom and sales floor be in disarray especially now since customers leave the aisles a hot mess. Hours are cut as well."
bad,"I have been with the company for over 5 years and I make the exact same as the new hires, some make more than I do. Because of my great work ethic I've been moved around to 4 different positions during my time with the company but my compensation lacks. I am the only person in my work center so when I have to call off there is no one to cover my shift and I have to come back to chaos. Management is not willing to assist when I need help and most days I'm left to figure out things on my own. Stressful is the perfect word to describe the target environment."
bad,"Apparently anyone can be a manager there as long as u have a degree in literally anything but screw the employee who have given years to the company. I feel set up to fail everyday. What is asked of me is unreasonable most everyday. Policey constantly changing and they want you to change immediately. There no consistency in my day to day work, schedule, and not even the higher pay can keep many people. The company cares only for profit while pretending to be inclusive by having more sizes but most are only available online. More work piled on but less pay roll. I could go on. Avoid if possible."
bad,I like it here but I do not want to work here much longer then I half to. It is a amazing place to be working at but it just not for me to work at and I do not to work and not love my job.
bad,"Overall, I enjoyed the work that I did, however the culture of the company has been to move out all talented leaders with higher wage earnings and bring in kids from college to run the business."
bad,Everything you've come to hate about retail bundled into one unlikable package. Managers do not care about your scheduling and will take any chance they can to jerk you around.
bad,"Target, an unorganized and unprofessional company. My GM is lazy, flirts with any younger girls, and he is straight up favoritism. Just observe and you'll see. HR is lazy after orientation. Once you're an employee working, if you don't click with her, she'll give you attitude. TL's lazy and clicky, depending on location. The younger TL is lazier, but good at making excuse. They gossip like there's no tomorrow, even in front of you. Surprise no managers noticing it. ""OH wait, GM is the same."" This place is only for kids and retire people, if you want a actual professional job, look elsewhere."
bad,"Attendance Policy is UNACCEPTABLE what a waste of time and Money to hire all the new people just to RUN THEM AWAY , Not a good feeling after ACTUALLY be expected to work 60 hrs for 6 months SWEAT SHOP Mentality more TALKING than Anything BUT got gave Supervisors EVERYWHERE doing Nothing but trying to INTIMIDATE new workers AWFUL Experience and Very DISAPPOINTING"
bad,They tell you to cross train to get more hours but continue to hire new people and give them the hours. Management had poor communication with each other and the staff.
bad,"It is really nice to work at target, however you can't make that much money there, because there is not enough hours to everyone you will have to work all week long for only 8 hours. Management is not good  enough to keep employees satisfied, so they can stay there for a while. workplace culture is very cool you will meet a lot of people from different cultures which is great."
bad,"Supervisor told me that my behavior ""makes me want to punch someone in the face."" According to corporate, she was not terminated for violating the zero-tolerance workplace violence policy since the comment was not specifically directed at me. Unsubstantiated coachings followed. Another associate gave my schedule to my ex-wife. Both associates still work there as of this review."
bad,"The pay is nice but for your mental health this place is awful. The FC is awful, just like a sweat shop. The RDC is a better place but still not great. Within the first week you will be bothered non stop about making prod. They will treat you like you’re at an elementary school level age and will talk down to you constantly. You are not a human, you are sadly just a number who can somehow be expected to make an unrealistic prod within first starting and once you continue learning new things. The main thing that makes target so disgusting and terrible is that you will work 60 hours a week with no choice of how they schedule you and switch things up. They lie at orientation about how much overtime there is. It’s nonstop. You have no time for family. If you like being a robot and treated like a child and don’t have a family this would be a great place. They also forced people to go onto night shift when NOTHING was ever mentioned about that. So sad people continue to let them walk over them."
bad,"Scandalous management, they have no regards for the cost of living. One week you'll get plenty of hours and the next week you may only be on the schedule for two days. Once I was scheduled for two days out of a whole month."
bad,"When applying for target they claim that they are “flexible” when it comes to your schedule but they really aren’t. I worked here for a couple of months and loved that it’s fast paced but it’s stressful because of the amount of work you had to do in 8 hours. I would work four 8hr days then get a day off, work four 8hr days then another day off so it felt like you never really had days off. When I started school and needed to change my availability, the main supervisor for my area got upset and denied my request. If you want to have a work/life balance and also be able to attend school, don’t work here."
bad,"The entire job is a fast pace, move it or lose it, attitude from the managers. You work as fast as you can to avoid the criticism they will give  you otherwise."
bad,"It's a job in retail, so it's about how you would expect. There's a lot of manual labor, hours get cut, hours get overloaded, customers are not always kind."
bad,"I’ve worked at target twice now and every time that I need time off or if I call in because of an emergency, it is the literal end of the world. I asked for 38 hours a week, I get 13 while everyone else gets above 20. When I injured my shoulder at work I was treated like garbage. I’m dressed coded all the time even though it’s within dress code. Eyes get rolled every time I walk into a room. Not a good place to work."
bad,"Unloaded trucks and stocked shelves in morning crew. Hours where erratic and often  nearly non existent off season.  Managers pushed for an extreme pace during winter season, then were seemingly apathetic to any subsequent turnover on the off season."
bad,"They didnt care when they were awear that I had a stoke years ago, leaving short term memory. They dismissed it buy asked if i needed more training. For what my short ter memory. What did they mg an attorneyean. Very unhappy. calling somone with superior position. It was not a termanation."
bad,Target has high turnover and they expect a lot for the pay. The management isn’t any more stable then the staff. The training is now almost nonexistent and despite what you are told during an interview plan on 4-5 hour shifts a day.
bad,"Every Christmas, they hire many new hires and cut down people who’ve been there for years. Nepotism always.   Bad workers continue to call in and still have a job. Too much favoritism. Wasted years there."
bad,"After policy for corporate began to change, the energy started to change in the work environment. I left closing every night crying. Managers expected things of you that were above your pay grade, I left later than I was supposed to every night when they were fully informed that I was a full time student and had class the next morning."
bad,"I was hired as a fulfillment associate. I was lied to about the hours I could expect to receive. I was told 25-30 but in reality it was 10-20. My last paycheck was several weeks late as well.  "
bad,The management was very irritating. They promote/hire from stereotypes. A typical workday inculded getting yelled at for not finishing 15 objectives in a four hour shift.
bad,"The pay is somewhat competitive, but usually isn’t worth the headache of working here. The management is disappointing at best and the employees are not appreciated."
bad,"I didn't like working here, management was cool and I loved them, but I hated them. They would consistently schedule me to close, then to open within 6 hours the next day. It was miserable and I don't miss the schedule of retail."
bad,"an ok place to work at, the women there are immature, would rather break you down so they can get higher up in target. hr doesn’t listen to the complaints people give."
bad,"Management's expectations in the general merchandise department are insane. All of my co-workers have given up on trying to meet expectations. I like to think I'm a hard worker. I realize everyone thinks that about themselves so take that as you will. For the first year or so of my employment at target, I felt like I was doing well and achieving what was expected of me. Over the past year, however, expectations have changed drastically. In general merchandise, the number of people working during my shifts has halved. Now management is 'seeing a decline in the quality of work' and is very confused that I am seemingly unable to do double the work without losing any of the detail. My coworkers regularly tell each other that we shouldn't take it too seriously and all we can do is our best, but after being told by management over and over that I'm not meeting expectations, I start to wonder why I'm even trying. I tried for a long time but eventually I realized that I can't physically do what is being asked of me. I'll be working elsewhere soon. If you work hard and strive to impress your employer, don't work here."
bad,The work load for a 5hr shift is exceptionally large for 1 person with no way to finish in time. No support. Management does not communicate with each other. Direction given from multiple managers each saying something different. Erratic schedule.
bad,Graduated from college and this was my first management job. Loved my team and accomplishments. The hours were the hardest part. Learned that the general public is very hard to work in and the hours did not meet my family life
bad,"This company does not care about you. You need time off or to work around scheduling for anything...well good luck. I have never worked at such a bad job in my 10 years of working. Even fast food places treated me better than this. "
bad,"Overnight unloading and loading trucks. Moving trucks. Warehousing work, shrink wrapping pallets and unloading products on to the store floor. Wouldn't recommend."
bad,"Honestly a decent place to work for a while. Very slow and monotonous work, terrible management and Leaders. They don’t work around your schedule and don’t communicate with eachother very well."
bad,I left Target because I was paid just above the minimum wage and was expected to do a large amount of work in a short time. I also grew tired of being forced to close one night and then open the next after repeated requests to no longer schedule me that way. They do not care about their employees’ well being in my experience.
bad,The environment is stressful and the employers ask too much from you without giving you the acknowledgment you deserve. The payout is just not enough.
bad,"Working for target would have been better through more communication. Communication is the key to make anything good, great. Communication from one side will never work."
bad,people were good. supervision were pretty good for me. anything above that were just snotty people who think are always better than you. mist meet quotas or your written up or even fired.
bad,"They keep employees after getting several complaints about them due to harassment. Too much work, not enough pay or hours cut drastically with no notice."
bad,"Style team DOES EVERYTHING ! but gets the same pay as a cashier. They do not care about your personal life or if u have children .   since the small raise hours are horrible. The team leaders and managers talk to you like your nothing just because their position is higher than yours and they can fire u , they have Favoritisms and they put a lot of stress and pressure on you to meet unrealistic.. only positive is the pay is decent but not that decent if people doing little to nothing gets paid the same as u goals they set."
bad,"Target appeared exciting and like it would be a positive place to work, but that all faded within the first few weeks. TM are very kind and willing to help, however, management is simply all over the place! The amount of hours quickly escaladed within the first few weeks since there is a lack of sufficient TM. Also, some new TM can and may be overly pressured into how fast they can finish an obviously unfinishable task within the time they're given. Constant pressure was put upon me to finish tasks that obviously could not be finished in one shift. Then blame was put on me or guilt trips were used to inspire me to work faster than I already could. It takes talking to ETLs for the excessive pressuring to stop. Management seems very unprofessional and the constant pressure can become stressful very quickly."
bad,"I have been at target for awhile sales associate and all that. I got employee of the the month was rewarded with nothing, pay is not fair at all, scheduling is bad. discount is only 10%, don't work here."
bad,"From my first day until the day I quit, EVERYONE was putting in their two weeks to get out of there also! I didn’t know I was pregnant when I got hired but when they found out they worked me too hard and claimed that they were not even though I was new and pregnant, I was rushed and everyone had a partner to work with except me. I was reported for working too slow even though I was in pain. My doctor sent a note in and they claimed I wasn’t doing anything hurtful for my baby but I was and became high risk. I was constantly standing and bending plus going to the bathroom got me yelled at and they couldn’t reach everyone due to not having enough wallet talkies yet it was our fault if we didn’t hear them. Breaks are all short and I was constantly compared to other mothers saying “well I was able to do this when I was pregnant”. The only enjoyable part was some of the co-workers but as soon as you do something they don’t like then management takes down their fake kind act and make you all want to quit. Not to mention my coworkers were always asking me to cover for them so they could go get drunk in TJ together and if I asked them to cover me they would agree but then not show. Also you have to do cashier even if it isn’t your job which makes it harder to get your actual job done on time like they expect you to."
bad,"I worked for the target on 87th and cottage grove in Chicago IL, and I was transferred to the Roosevelt location, THEY WERE VERY RUDE. they caused me to have several emotional break downs and they use their workers as labors for little pay. they plan to go up to $15, but it does not matter because that 15 dollars cause many people to quit their jobs, budget cuts are always being made and money is always being missed I would sue this company if I had the patience."
bad,"Inconsistent hours, they will ask to change your schedule daily to suit their needs, if you cant you are punished by cutting your hours. Management were horrible, not supportive, borderline harassing, lots of politics. No room for advancement, they make promises but never follow through. Good luck using your PTO because HR never seem to approve or check requests. Very negative overall vibe which is set by management but blamed on all employees. They will work you until you cant take it anymore and you quit, and then replace you with the never ending revolving door of new employees. Within the 8 months I was employed in the store, almost the entire staff in the store (25+ people) quit, including people that had been with the company for 8 + years. The plus side of the job were the  few other lower level employees who were stressed and struggling but still made an effort to be friendly. Unfortunately this was not the majority. The employee discounts were decent if you got a red card (10% of all merch, and extra 15% off organic foods and fitness clothing)."
bad,Very unprofessional supervisors that were not too mindful of the workers and the way the administered their supervision / authority. Showed a lot of favoritism / preferences towards certain workers.
bad,"So a typical work day at Target was, you'd show up for your designed shift, you'd punch in, get your stuff necessary for working, go to your area, and then you'd start getting yelled at to do something that you'd already been planning on doing on your own, and or get yelled at for something someone else has either failed to do, or did incorrectly."
bad,When I worked you stocked shelves went home in morning in shoes I did pulls and backstock I was there 14 years management was bad they picked on certain people every day I went to Brentwood target recently you do more work today pulls and backstock you the only one in department I told them I did that management told me find another job not this one I’m not qualified
bad,Now it’s a new management that I’m really not satisfied with. I hate working with some people in there they got some personal problems. I think target should offer counseling
bad,"They use your body driving you till you either injure yourself or leave, everyday is a new stupid policy about safety so they don’t have to pay comp claims, when the repetitive job itself causes them. Then they dump you like trash."
bad,"The job itself wasn't that taxing, but the management made the best and hardest worker quit. it had a high school clique vibe...as in if you didn't kiss butt you'd get nowhere. all promotions were given to personal favorites instead of the qualified party."
bad,They so favorite too different people....u can’t do no overtime if u do they send u home early.They want u to do 5 different jobs in a 8 hour shift....and help customers at the same time.There no advancement....they choose people outside of the job to become supervisor.
bad,"Target is such a competitive company, and feel the need to work their employees to the bone. They hire people all the time seasonally, and then let them go. There is rarely advancement in the company, and if you are advanced you had to have been there for years upon years. The drop in hours is ridiculous and yet they expect for you to finish your task, yet you’ve only gotten 4 hours for the day. I would NOT recommend this company as a job for anyone."
bad,"I loved working here when I started a couple years ago. My management was amazing, my direct leader was (and still is) someone I view very highly.  The work is very easy, as I preferred to be on my feet all day. Environment was very welcoming and relaxed. However it is an entirely different store now unfortunately. Good management transferred out and are replaced with people who lacked the skills or experience to be in their positions. Nobody trusts their management and favoritism as at an all time high. I've personally had issues with the new store manager defaming my character with false accusations and was wrongfully terminated when they altered my schedule without notice to rack up no calls. Good management can make a world of difference in a workplace and bad management can make every shift miserable to show up for."
bad,"Target recently restructured the employee duties and it is hard work without enough schedule time to do it. Corporate says to schedule a certain amount of hours and the work load is never completed. Then you are asked why. Your responsibilities include pulling items from the back room, putting them back into a location if they do not fit, putting items out on the floor from the truck, straightening isles, price changing, assisting guests within the department and at the checkout, etc. How?"
bad,"Target really could be a cool place to work. Most managers are cool, usually Target long-timers. "
bad,"Target has such great concepts and visions,  yet the value of their employee doesn’t seem as important as the executives. I’m sure if I were an executive, I would enjoy it more. They go on consistent vacations and use text to micromanage their team leaders while they are gone. When the employee is suffering from medical issues, they have no sense of urgency in processing their leave. If a team leader has an emergency they are not allowed to switch with a team member so it is a mandatory call out though it could have been avoided. That said, the company puts emphasis on mental health but it is not executed well in stores."
bad,"I have worked for Target for 4 1/2 years. I have enjoyed working for them and I loved the fact you are able to transfer to another store as we have moved numerous times."
bad,"The location where I worked had terrible management. Scheduling was a game because there were three versions of the active schedule, none of which agreed with the others. The execution was poorly done and at one point I was nearly written up for a series of absences which I did not commit. I would have had to have missed almost half of my shifts at that point in time in order for that accusation to be accurate. Not to mention the fact that as a minor, they scheduled me to close alone even though minors are not allowed by the state to remain in the work place past 9:30 and they hadn't completed my training schedule. It is hard for an administration to merit criticism from me, I was the kid in school who loved my teachers and applauded the staff for their work, but the administration at my location of Target was a mess."
bad,"this target, in particular, has a HORRIBLE moral system. everyone is angry and fighting and talking about each other. it’s high school, and the managers are the regina george’s of the store. there are a few managers who do the absolute most for the employees, but not all of them. which i would understand, if those managers weren’t sitting together talking about the employees. and don’t even bother going to them with any problems, only the favorites get their voices heard. everyone says they want to work here for the good pay, except it evens out with the minimal hours and the massive work load. the managers give you 8 tasks and expect you to do all of them and fix the whole store in a five hour shift. a specific manager, is going to be the downfall of the whole store. she is the reason for FOUR people, recently to have left. and there are more on their way out the door because of her. the only reason the few team members will stay, is because they think by running to her and telling her everyone else’s business, they’ll get something out of it, which they do, all the hours possible and all the shifts they want."
bad,"Loved the “guests” as they’re called, didn’t care too much about how many leads were passed around through the food area. Favoritism is huge in Target. If you aren’t a favorite, you don’t get hours. They also require you to have a lot of responsibilities without the pay for it- basically doing the same job as a lead but not the pay, but that’s retail for you. Also it doesn’t matter if you have been there for a month or 5 years, you get paid the same amount."
bad,"Job can be much better with hours. "
bad,"Easy job. Will either stock, cashier, or clean. Minimum wage, always part time, there's no guarantee/security for schedules & hours. Sometimes managment would change already posted schedules & take hours away from people. Sometimes can't use vacation time even when requested months in advance. "
bad,It’s not worth the emotional and physical demands because you won’t be appreciated and have to take a whole lot of negativity from management. They don’t believe in their employees they think they can treat them however they want and tell you you’re doing a bad job when you are doing a good job and working really hard. They expect their employees to do the job of four or five people everyday and even when you do that they will never say good job. The management bullies you and they are extremely unorganized at least the apparel department was and then they blame you for their own unorganization and inconsistency. Don’t work here! You can find a much better job we’re they appreciate you and are organized.
bad,Pay is not affordable for living. And hours are not being given as much. Still hiring more people so that they don’t have to give benefits. I learned great customer service however. Was able to keep registers clean and organized. Allowed for a chance to work with different people in difficult situations.
bad,"Very disappointed with the lies that were created by hr to block my unemployment benefits. Management "
bad,Management is extremely inconsistent and offers zero room to grow. employees are treated as fi they were expendable and everyone knows this so no one really cares.
bad,Awful place to work. The leaders and management do absolutely nothing and give completely unrealistic goal times for tasks we are given. Only care about themselves and making sure the team does all the heavy lifting so they can sit on their butts and look good for corporate. no opportunity to move up unless you are favored. Hard work means nothing. Everyone is micromanaged like we are 5 years old. Completely backwards company. Stay away.
bad,Don’t work here unless you absolutely need a job and even then they don’t give you much to work with. Barely get any hours. Mainly they just use people don’t care about you or your health.
bad,"Working at Target was really fun until they hired a new district manager, then everything dropped down hill. You weren't able to take days off even for vacations, and we're not alot to have breaks for a drink of water."
bad,"My time at target was less than enjoyable. There is a very high turn around rate and because of this, the employees are not treated well due to the idea they will not be there long. They are worked hard and never really feel like they can take a break."
bad,hired outside to upper position instead of within first did not help with learning new things within the store did not do well when it came to volunteer events within our community
bad,"The management at this place needs assistance. They wonder why they're always hiring because they do not know how to properly treat their employees so they keep leaving. If you can get through their fake attitudes and smiles, passive behavior, the hours they schedule for that you did not ask for but are responsible for anyway completely disregarding your availability you applied with, then you should be alright I guess. The only thing that can get you through your shift is being with other coworkers and bonding over how unfair you're being treated. Haha."
bad,"A normal day is usually spent trying to figure out a constantly changing order system, dealing with broken machines, and aggravating guests."
bad,"Target is only a good lace to work at for about 6 months. WOrking there for 3 years has taught me new skills in my certain teams. but also taught me that target management has no idea what they are doing. Run by favoritism and Negative energy, you either get 30+ hours a week or 8 hours a week, sometimes not working for a week or two. Overall working at target is not worth it for a long term job. would not recommend unless youre 18 looking for a first job."
bad,"My time at Target was awful. I got minimal training, my paychecks were inconsistent, my schedule could and would change at the drop of the hat, I got harassed by my superior about my glasses of all things.It was worse then my job at Spirit and that place had no AC in the Arizona Summer!"
bad,During my time working for Target I realized working in this establishment you had to politics with leads in order for them to like you and you to feel comfortable in that establishment they had to like you. I didnt like that one bit cause they werent genuinely friendly they all talked about each other so i never wanted to get involved.
bad,"Target is starting to cut down on how many people are working at it's stores. Unless you're being paid a salary, hours are very inconsistent and benefits aren't very good. Target will make sure not to schedule you enough hours to qualify for health insurance through them."
bad,They hire their pants off and cut hours of experienced employees. Conflicting management with little to no support of team. Management likes to chat all day and watch the floor workers run around like chickens with their heads cut off.
bad,"They want you to do the job of 2-3 people every shift. No time for actual customer service since work is non-stop and done on the run. They call you on days off to work and when you can't do it (since you actually have a life and family outside Target) you get labeled by management as a non-team player. The store itself is staffed largely by 20 year olds. Fellow ""team members"" barely make eye contact with each other due to the workload and expectations. It reminds me in many ways of working  in a factory.  ...….On the upside, most customers in the area (in Target-speak ""Guests"") are nice, higher-income earners who are polite and undemanding.There's something better for you out there - keep looking."
bad,"Target claims to have something called a Team Lead bench, which allegedly influences the hiring of internal candidates for managerial positions, but in the end, it's a meaningless title, and candidates are chosen externally in most cases."
bad,Target was a okay place to work but the management would never give me time off to go see my father when i was in high school and made me work when i was inquired
bad,"No benefits for first year for full time employees, get written up if you get ANY overtime, management is gossipy and unreliable, and hours are not flexible. I worked as a GSA which had all responsibilities with MUCH lower pay and respect. I made the same as the people I was coaching. Was promised advancement pending a position opening in management in job offer and then denied. I immediately was discouraged starting this job and can not think of one pro. Gave my two weeks and was told that in fact I'd have to work 2.5 due to scheduling or I'd be marked as non-rehire. I was fine with that."
bad,Good starting job however unless you plan to be an etl or higher   you will never afford to live on your own if you live with your parents or fresh out of high school good job to make some spending cash
bad,"At my time with target is cda, ID. I was constantly pushed around by upper management. The main store team lead and HR ladies were so rude they pushed me towards a mental break. If you live in the cda area and are looking for a job, my advice is not to work here unless you constantly want to be bullied and picked on by woman who are constantly on power trips."
bad,"The demands are huge and you can never get enough done to get recognition. No matter what you do, it's never enough. Couple that with poor pay and rude customers. Dream job, right?"
bad,"Well, let us see, start from the beginning. You would get into work, wearing your colors that you had to buy yourself, and the company environment was pretty awful, to put it nicely. The managers, they came and went, but were overall good, not great, just good. The single worst thing about working at Target was the Redcard. That was the bane of my existence as an employee. You were required, by corporate, to ""sell"" X number of cards a week or get reprimanded for being ""lazy"". Most of the customers simply didn't want our card, and I couldn't blame them, it wasn't a good card, and the data security was really bad, and I didn't think the benefits of ""5% off your purchase using the Redcard at Target"" was good enough. Yet we were forced to force them onto the customers, it was a really bad situation overall."
bad,"The target location I worked at wasn't the best, I had bad experiences with the leaders there. Also, because of the area I would encounter many rude customers."
bad,It’s difficult to work at a place where you have to do 5 people jobs at once... but target was a place we’re they would promise you a spot higher up then would give it to someone else. They didn’t care that the team leads would take 2 hour breaks but would care if a team member took a extra 5 minutes to use the bathroom on breaks.
bad,"hours are inconsistent,management team dishonest about how many hours they have. The management is young, & their style is poor. They are incompetent."
bad,"Depending upon your facility and management Target can be an OK place to work. Scheduling issues abound....Security for guests and team members could use a MAJOR increase. Hardest part of job is expectations by management to do 3-5 things at once while not scheduled enough time to do your job well. What I enjoy about the job is the customer service aspect - helping people find what they need/interacting and advising, et al. My particular workplace culture is good - we work well together."
bad,"The management at Peru Target is saddening. There is a lack of professionalism and I'd liken it to that of a high school clique. Not only does the store team lead and other managers play favoritism, they will also distribute more hours unfairly to their favorite employees. There is also a lack of communication between leaders, leading you to be asked to complete many different tasks all at once. Nothing is consistent."
bad,I would stock and unload trucks. it was very fast paced and you had to be in shape and learn quickly. Your on a time limit to get the product out before the store opened in the morning so you would have to move quick and efficiently .
bad,"target used to be a kool place to work. that's what i heard before i got there. once hired, that quickly went out the window because the new regional manager changed the daily in store procedures and really created chaos among the staff. i haven't been in to that store since i left but if they are applying the same basic routines then i would not suggest target as a place for employment.."
bad,"Management has no ability to motivate the team, compensation is not great either. Overall it is just a typical job, no team support or happiness coming from this position."
bad,"I was a cart attendant. Hard work, even harder due to the slop that the parking lot was set on. Other cart attendants were unreliable and one manager would make me stay 30 minutes after shift pushing carts off of the main drag for cleaning."
bad,"I've worked at target for almost 2 years and honestly this is the worst job I've ever worked at. The management is awful all the managers have lack of respect for the employees treats everyone like garbage , they expect you to put your life on the line for this job everyday. They choose favourites and what's even worst is that one of the managers dated a young employee...its terrible they even bother you when your on break sometimes even make you miss your break and change schedules without telling anyone. The Managers are so mean that they sometimes make employees cry and stressed out. They don't care if your too sick to work they'll still force you to come in And last but not least they don't give hours they give people at least 5 hours a day or less...."
bad,"I worked at Target temporarily as a softgoods team member. Many of the fulltime employees were standoffish and didnt want to assist when I had problems. As a softgoods team member, I was also required to be on register (1 hr of training) and act as the store operator by answering and directing incoming calls. These two responsibilities I was not told of during interview."
bad,"Provide fast fun and friendly customer service."
bad,"The implementation of retail is different from Target with other Retail stores. It really depends on if you are customer service driven vs. factory line logistics driven. This company tends to err on the later one. The demographics of the workers focuses on the younger students, or minority demographics without college education (the people are pretty friendly though). The pay is around $12-$15 an hour. One should try out other opportunities to hone sale skills. Restocking shelves and pushing out cartons of material is the norm. The place where Target doesn't train its employees on lies around sales, and it is up to employees to learn how to close deals. I would recommend working for other retail stores that emphasize training techniques with regards to customer satisfaction, and those jobs are generally commission based. Remember, Target is run like a factory more than a retail store."
bad,"Management can make or break your time here. It’s retail so the hours are minimal unless you’re cross trained in other areas. Communication between STL  ETLs, and TLs is sometimes nonexistent, causing a lot of tension on team members. Work life balance is virtually nonexistent, as it’s hard to consistently know when you’ll be off for anything. The discount isn’t worth anything, since you can only really use it if you have a red card or constantly have cash, aside from the fact is all it really does is give you 10% which is abysmal. "
bad,Target pays okay for a college student or high school student but if you are working here for full time  as your main source of income then you will barely get by . They ignore your availability  and do not care about you being in school. You are over worked and are given some unreasonable end task for the night.  They will try to make you stay 1-3 hours after close to continue working into 1 or 2 in the morning. If you refuse to stay later or try to leave at your scheduled time you will be written up.
bad,"It's a typical retail job, very mundane. Wish they would play some music to liven up the store. Most people that work there seem depressed and have no will for anything greater in life."
bad,"Management is hired on not knowing anything about their job or the job that the employees.  As the employee you do not have a voice ."
bad,"I worked for and loved Target for several years.Target used to value their store leaders; for their judgement, for their time, and for their experience and knowledge. However, as the economy has shifted and the retail environment has changed so have they. They saw value in district-wide meetings for both Store Team Leaders and other leaders, but to save on costs these are no longer allowed. This leaves huge gaps in communication, and getting answers from corporate is almost impossible. We rarely see results from giving feedback. Roll-outs and new initiatives aren't as thoroughly planned out and frequently are left to the stores to try to figure out last minute. For salaried leaders like myself work/life balance became a thing of the past, store and district leaders actively encouraged increasingly longer days to compensate for reduced payroll. Advancement opportunities are given entirely on the whim of the district leaders, so if you haven't worked in their store in the past or don't make a strong impression during the 15 minutes they spend in the store every month it's not likely you will get the opportunity to even interview."
bad,"Top down management structure isn't one that is willing to work with team members. Inflexible work schedule, if you don't have open availability you are punished with minimal hours. Scheduling is wildly varied, and understaffed."
bad,executive team leads use people to further their career instead of helping or promoting people below them. If they dont like you they will force you out at any level of employment.
bad,"As a student attending high school, I was looking for a part time job, not a job that would take over. I would tell them my availability and somehow, I would still be scheduled on those days. I had put that I wanted to work 20 to 25 hours at the maximum, yet one week, I worked more than 30. A typical day of work consisted of being indirectly ranked by how many Red Cards you could sell, which being a minor, I did not have much experience selling credit cards to customers. . From this job I learned how to use the register and solve issues that happened around the registers or self-check out. At times, I would be the only employee there to watch both, or close one and open up the other. Whenever we told management about this, they never did anything to fix it. The best part of the job was the co workers. Being the youngest cashier, many were nice to me and helped me whenever I made mistakes. They were there for me more than management."
bad,"Target was once a place to work that was flexible with hours and had a great work environment. Over the past few years, it had grown far too strict on hours and does not encourage creativity and input from employees. Urging team members to quit if they refuse to fully conform to all process procedures, even if you can make it more efficient."
bad,"While they do pay more per hour than most retail places, they give too few to make the hourly pay worth it.  Management plays favorites and gives hours to them over other harder working employees.  Communication is near non existent until you are talked to about breaking a new policy that you were never told was in place.   Average shift is about 4 hours where you will be expected to work out freight from truck, straighten your area, put back returns, fill from back stock, and help customers."
bad,welcome to the hardest job to be accepted for. you will never be able to eat alone everyone will beg you for food you will watch bad tv on your break. you will always work with women.
bad,"a typical work day consisted of under staff, aggressive and poor work environment. We were treated as just numbers. management had favorite employees and undermined-ed  everyone else. Felt very unappreciated at the work place. Was talked down to regularly."
bad,It's a stressful job for little pay. They give you unrealistic expectations. And there aren't consistent enough hours to pay your bills. The enviorment is toxic due to gossip and poor management. I would never recommend working for Target
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal employee in October for the thanksgiving and Christmas season. At first I thought that everyone at my store was pretty chill and relaxed, but as I got to know everyone I discovered that the managers (at my store) were very secretive and would lie to your face about things regarding you as an employee. I attempted to get my training for cashier done so that I could help out when it is busy, I asked my department lead if she could find a time to get me trained and after weeks of asking and still getting no training time through her I had to go and get it done myself. Talking to the managers was probably the most difficult part of the job because they always made you feel like you were interrupting or bothering them. The HR team at my store was a total joke, they were totally cool with breaking so many rules and would use their power to distort the true situation so that they were never responsible or the managers were never wrong. It is honestly the work of the part time employees and the stockers and cashiers that keep Target running."
bad,"A typical day at work it is mandatory to volunteer to work at any asked department that they're short of. Try to be extra flexible and stay below the radar. Work hard and pace yourself."
bad,"Target could be a good place to work if you’re part time but full time no. They will give you “40 hours” but slowly cut your hours, you just have to catch it when viewing your schedule. Certain departments are good to work for some aren’t. The store manager is great but the leaders are all rude and disrespectful."
bad,"The management was horrible. They pursue you to stay longer hours even if you have reasons of not being able to stay. you either get 5-8 hours or 39 hours, you really don't know until they post your schedule."
bad,"I was responsible for unloading trucks in the morning at Target. I enjoyed my job, however after management changed I found myself loathing when I would have to work. The new manager never scheduled enough people to finish our work on time (e.x. She would only schedule 4 people to unload and stock a 25 foot trailer in 2 hours). Over all, Target is probably a better place to work than most base level jobs, but don't think that it can be a lively hood."
bad,You clock in at work unload the truck and then begin moving merchandise to the floor. Being in the back room whatever merchandise comes off the truck that is not brought to the floor is back stocked in the back room
bad,"This is a typical retail job. Target is not the place for people looking to advance in their career, unless they are already graduated with a bachelors degree. They prefer you just do your job silently."
bad,"Stressful, unfair pay, work hours are messed up. Some weeks you work 40+ hours others you work 8 hours but are still considered part time and paid as part time and not full time. Management gets upset if you do not take overtime even though it is optional and they make you feel bad."
bad,being a cashier was fun at first but as time carried on it got to be hard on my shoulder and managment was pushy towards Red Cards making the experacnce for the costomer and us workers harder.
bad,"Pay was minimum wage. As a GSA (front end supervisor / cash office) I was given a $.50 raise. Then a 5 cent annual raise. When I cut my hours to part time, the took my $.50 away. I was paid $7.33 / hr to work in their cash office handling hundreds of thousands of dollars coming in and out of the store."
bad,Well I started working on the weenked and I called in the don’t need any body HR keeps lying to they where going to call I actually have a enough keep calling to them I am doing seasonal it’s not a long term job it’s stressful and not the great to work fulfillment the schedules Sucks not enough hours or days to come to work it’s on them not on me.
bad,"A typical day at work is having everyone messing around while few people are actually doing their jobs. But once I started talking to someone else, I would get yelled at in front of everyone in the store. Some weeks you get from 0-4 hours, even when you have bills to pay and children to care for. All the good employees never get acknowledged for their good work. Which is why I left because they never reward or let their employees know they did a good job.  I wouldn't recommend working here."
bad,if you are ok with working with the expectation of getting 401K with heath/dental/vision/life insurance after 1 year then dont be surprised to be fired at around the 10-11 month mark
bad,"As a minor you could not work even 4 hours on weekdays. Always 3 hrs 45 mins or less. Like 6 times a week. It was a waste of time going to work for such little time and coming back home at an odd time of night to complete responsibilities. Lots of pressure on getting RedCards. Your moment of glory only lasts that shift and the next day it’s the same pressure even though most people already have RedCards or simply aren’t interested, it is highly expected of you to at least get one- if you fail to get one, you are looked down upon and told you do not take your job seriously. You must always ask people for a RedCard EVEN at SELF CHECKOUT - it’s very uncomfortable. Almost impossible to move up the ladder unless you kiss your team leader’s rear and gossip with them. Managers and Human Resources are hardly ever present and lack communication skills with their employees- hard to talk to when a problem arises. Really rude when you call out sick. Favoritism is such a big problem, you will see when a group of people are talking doing nothing with the team leads and others are doing their job but receive no praise. NO COMMISSION when you have someone sign up for a RedCard- so there’s absolutely no movitation for you to bug people besides fear of losing your job. Unless of course, you’re the managers favorite."
bad,Management at this Target is terrible. There is no way to fix it because corporate does listen. These Managers have no respect for employees. Especially HR. They want you to bend over backwards for them just so they can spit in your face.
bad,I worked here seasonally. Upon being hired I was told they were going to keep me on after the holidays and when I asked for that to be put in writing they said no. When the time came they decided not to keep me which I feel violated a verbal contract. Like many retail positions I feel like they expect too much and value their employees too little.
bad,"Target in 2018 is all politics. Target can really careless about their employees. Their was no work life balance within the company. I suggest if you are 16 years old and need a summer job Target is all that's it good for. "
bad,"Promised me at least 35 hours a week, I would have been lucky to have gotten 20 hours a week. Hours were so inconsistent I never knew when I was going in or leaving half of the time. I learned how to be a cashier, which I didn't mind too much because I really needed a job at the time. I hate standing in one place all day so being a cashier wasn't the best option for me. "
bad,"Dont work here, they bend too easily to customer demands and dont care what their associates think and it sure seems the female managers are out to get the male associates fired or written up for whatever reason they can find"
bad,If you are looking at Target as a part time job for something to do while you are in school or in training then I would recommend but not for something long term. I was hired on as a truck team member originally and the work load was easy for the most part and there were lots of opportunities to fulfill  other roles in the store in the back or on the salesfloor. Management was terrible to say the least. Target has what is called ETLs (Executive Team Leaders) who are essentially college graduates who have typically never done retail to run the major areas of the store. I had very few good experiences with these people as most of them saw Target as an annoyance they had to do until they moved on to something bigger. The ETLs typically clashed with the regular store Team Leaders and gossip among team members was common. Overall Target was high school all over again and management was sorta allowed to do what they wanted.
bad,"My experience at target was very stressful and lots of drama coming from the management. The employees and LOD's were very disrespectful and so were some of the team members. I know we all go to work for 1 thing but I wanted to atleast enjoy coming to work instead of hating when the time comes. They really treated the remodel team like they were poo and didn't notice they were there, kind of gave everyone the vibe that we were not wanted. The LOD's showed favortism the whole remodel and started a lot of unnecessary drama and blamed it on the team member and basically fired everybody they started rumors with or about."
bad,"Target has a toxic employee/manager relationship in which the managers are almost instructed to be discourteous and demanding of employees and punish employees that cannot meet their extreme demands, alongside that is the ever changing list of criteria each employee must meet while not being told what that criteria is. expect to be ridiculed and demeaned when you don't reach those expectations. There are however a few good managers and ETLs left, but they get browbeat by the remaining managers and ETLs into compliance with their awful practices."
bad,Expect to much of a work load to few hours and was racialy biased showed lots of favoritism. Incompetent leadership .inconsistent work schedule.allows employees to work intoxicated
bad,I was a cashier I would check people out until my shift was over sometimes they would put me on the sales floor. A few times I worked in Customer service.
bad,"Work place for kids out of highschool. They come up with too many changes and the message is never consistent "
bad,"Working here isn't bad for a teenager in high school or just starting college, but for someone who needed this job to live off of isn't great at all. The work hours are very inconsistent, the managers are not always understanding in certain situations. Best part about the job was the people I worked with and being able to learn new job skills. I've worked in several areas of the store but before I left I was only getting 10-18 hrs a week."
bad,My least favorite thing about working at Target was having to stand in one spot (the cash registers) hours on end without being checked up on by managers nor supervisors. The training is very short and almost little to none before you're thrown onto the floor expected to understand everything.
bad,"it wasnt a very enjoyable place to work. pay was terrible, managers did not know what they were doing and there were a lot of favoritism amongst the higher ups. overall, it sucked"
bad,"Target is an awful place to work. I have worked here for 3 years as a barista at Starbucks. Team members are supposed to all have the same job responsibilities, but a few team members get stuck doing more than others, and it’s normally work for a manager. You would think after working here for 3 years I would get paid more than new team members, but every time you get a raise they raise the minimum wage. So whatever extra money you were making gets liquidated down to the new standard. Essentially I make the same amount of money as a brand new Starbucks employee even though I've been here for 3 years. It’s messed up and shows that even though you put in a ton of hard work and dedication to a job, you will not be rewarded for it. It's also a dead end job. There is no chance of you moving up to a higher position, you get stuck with the same pay and responsibility for years. Managers rarely ever show their face over at Starbucks. The team members pretty much fend for themselves and run the store. It is especially difficult when a Starbucks team member needs to take a break or a lunch because no one knows how to run Starbucks so there is no coverage. The team member will then normally have to skip a break or wait till the next person comes in, which could be an hour to two hours later. Overall just don’t work here. It’s a toxic environment full of people who don’t care about you."
bad,I love shopping at Target but working there is a different story. I had worked at target during 2 different durations and each time I had unsatisfactory occupations. The associates and management were originally kind and open to working as a team but after a month or two I realized that it was all for show. I was expected to meet unattainable goals and was provided with inadequate hours.
bad,Was a great place to work to experience different challenges that come from managing a big box retail store. The sales goals were unrealistic at times and the way they cycle managers doesn't foster close bonding between the team.
bad,its a stressful place to work for poor management not enough workers to help out the company don't want to pay overtime also a lack of leadership the raises are very poor.
bad,my typical day at work is  unload trucks. scan in product and use a fork truck to move product. i learned how to use a scanner and a fork trucks. The job is fast paced and we help a lot of new hires train
bad,"The store manager is great, he's the only manager who seems to care about his job. The other managers do not care at all, they do not show any support, they just walk around laughing and taking their time while seeing team members struggle. Some of them have even made team members cry, which is unacceptable and it just shows lack of management. It's like they do not even know how to hire people, people who don't even bother to show up. The only good thing about this place is the pay. But is the stress even worth it?"
bad,"The management at Target was very poor, they treat their employees with disrespect and do not value the experience that their associates brought with them to their position."
bad,"Didn't learn too much and management was very disorganized. Although I was part-time, they always overworked me. Once I worked 3 weeks with only one day off."
bad,Helped improve my organizational skills by stocking both the backroom and store shelves with merchandise.  Improved my teamwork abilities when my manager asked me to help my teammates finish their work.
bad,"Early shifts are slightly disappearing"
bad,"Target really depends on your management team. When I first started we had great management but as time went by, the good managers or etls as they call them all went to better places. What was brought in, was kids out of college that would blame their supervisors as to why things were not done correctly. Expectations at target are never good enough."
bad,"I worked as a barista in the Target Starbucks for just over two years, and it was terribly stressful every single day. Cleaning standards were never upheld, and there was never enough staff to even try to keep cleanliness up, because it was constantly busy every single day. At both locations I worked at, there were typically only two people on duty during each shift, when in reality it would take about 4 to get everything done. No manager ever wanted to increase staff because for some reason Target can't afford that many employees, and so whenever we had corporate inspections there would be a pile of things that we needed to correct. All of this came down on the employees, and never the managers. I always enjoyed my coworkers, as we had to get through every shift together and support each other. And I still shop at Target, they are an extremely accessible store for most people. Working there, though, is not always the best choice."
bad,Not really very good to work for. I hate to be negative. Have no medical benefits and only hire part time. Management doesn't keep you informed as to what is going on.
bad,"Good job but if your not a excutive in the company you are a nobody,been there 8 years and felt like a team member company is built to take care of the excutives and no one else"
bad,"You were givin 2min on each table in the women's dept to fold and size all of the t shirt tables, which is absolutely not manageable!!!  You run around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to complete everything that should be done, but there is not enough time to clean up after the messy customers that throw stuff on the floor and run their carts over the clothes. And then you are constantly being told you are not working fast enough, while they as managers only have to spend 30% of their time on the floor. If you are not in their list clicks you will never make it there!"
bad,Management is horrible and rude if you don't brown nose them. They don't care if you can pay your bills with all the hours they give you. I quit because I was only being scheduled 8 hours a week.
bad,"Target Hires Managers based solely on their education level leading to inefficient and poor leadership within the company on all levels."
bad,"Working at Target was great until a manager from Oregon came and took over. She fired a lot of people, made everyone unhappy, and ultimately ruined the culture of that particular store location."
bad,"Was told at interview i could be getting close to 40 hours a week, was not told that would require me to take extra shifts, working over 12 hours a day. Some weeks i work 6 days, do two 12 hours and still don't hit 40. receive a call on EVERY day off to come in because no one is ever punished for calling in. Scheduling is absurd. Attitude from all managers at all times, TLs constantly just making things up to complain about to justify their position.  no one above me cares about the job at all, constant eye rolling when asking for breaks, customers treated like garbage."
bad,"When I needed some sort of gainful employment Target was there. I started in logistics, receiving and stocking shelves around the store at night. It was the holidays and departments like toys and seasonal were especially busy. What started as a midnight shift with an overnight premium wage soon was changed to a early morning shift so they could remove the premium. They had a tendency to promote based on personal favoritism rather than work ethic or ability. "
bad,"The company itself is good,  it really comes down to who they put into place as upper management how each store does.  Great ETL's and STL means great place to work and the opposite is also true.  Loved my time there but it was just time to move on."
bad,Work for you team.  Don't let your team down. Don't be a disappointment to your team. Your not working fast enough for your team. You get the idea. Its very manipulative. Management doesn't appreciate individuality. Be on top of your game constantly. The coworkers you suffer with every day become your best friends.
bad,It got stressful at times.  There was to many buddy buddy stuff going on.  Certain people could do and get away with certain things and I didn’t think that was fair.
bad,"Great place to work for college kids. They are flexible on your hours, but don't give you as much as they could. Managers were cool, but needed more hours. They shorted my checks."
bad,"Target is an alright place to work if you can brown-nose your way to management, or get hired in for a management position. The one I worked for was a ""flag ship"" store, so any crazy ideas Corporate in Minnesota wanted to try out went to stores like ours all. The. Time. We were bug testers for awful systems that broke the way things barely ran."
bad,Team Lead overnight was very hard because of the Executives. They have respect for some of team leads. The employees are hard workers. I love the backroom team because they work hard and know what team work is.
bad,It’s very hard to get your work completed when you have other people’s work to do also. They cut hours at the end of the month so it makes it hard to pay your bills. ETL’s and STL of the store are horrible.
bad,"Es buena,se aprendio mucho la parte mas dificil era q querian q le empujaramos las targetas de credito a los clientes y los clientes nos salian con repugnancia."
bad,"It was a great first job the first few months and then everything went downhill super fast. Even the people who still work there would tell you it’s not fun and they hate it. Management is a joke. super rude and disrespectful. Didn’t accept doctors notes so when I was out for 2 weeks with the flu they called me into their office for a “talk” about my absences. Keep in mind, I had explained to them that I was Ill with the flu. Really dissapointed. My coworkers were the highlight of the days, they were so friendly and helpful. Would not work for them again, at least not in my state. Too bad."
bad,"I like to go to work sometimes,  depends on what manager is there and who I’m working with.  No one is ever on the same page at all.  Everything seems to be really unorganized and not planned out very well. Some days are better than others but team work is not there most the time."
bad,"Poor management, where the store lead goes hay girl to other employees real professional, not. Management has a very low IQ, and make up things that are wrong with your work so they can feel better about them selves. Not one manager there has a head on their shoulders"
bad,"The Target I have worked at is awful. The higher ups (the ETLs) are horrid to the employees and there are two of them that pretty much run the place without any consideration for anyone. They don't like to give hours, they make us run with only 3 to 4 cashiers the entire day, they get mad when we don't get any Red Cards in 10 minutes (they don't allow any type of recognition for getting one either or if they do it's just a ""congrats, now get ten more!"")."
bad,"I was a full time employees. This Store had awful managers. Things are supposed to be confidential but they're not."
bad,Target has a reputation for hiring recent college grads with little to no management experience.There is no 'human factor' when it comes to developing a team. There is no cohesiveness. The company could be so much more valuable if they would take the time to listen to and implement viable ideas from the front lines. They should also be more selective in who they hire at the store level. There is little confidence in the support staff at headquarters. There seems to be a disconnect.
bad,Inconsistent and inefficient management. Mostly temporary or part-time work with inconsistent weekly hours and no benefits provided due to part-time hours.
bad,"Current Logistics leader has no idea what she is doing, lacks strong leadership skills, has shady workplace practices, will chastise the wrong people for the worst reasons, cannot keep up with the team or keep the team on track, literally everyone in the store has complaints about her yet she still has a job."
bad,"Target used to be a great company to work for few years ago. Lately, Target is restructuring the entire company and hiring managers who have no experience in the retail back ground. Unfortunately, with that Target is hiring more employees but current employees hired on as full time employees are getting less than 20 hrs a week and when you submit sick time or vacation, they don't payout anymore."
bad,It was ok working there. I started the day they announced the closer of all target stores in Canada. The people where not really that interested in working for a company that was closing so that effected the whole morale.
bad,"Not only was the management way off,but every single “higher up” had the most rude attitude towards employees.They were looked at as “heartless” when it came to family emergencies as well as personal injuries."
bad,"Target is good at giving a person a chance and will hire people with tatoos and piercings.  Their raises are pathetic however.  My first year after working for them, I was given a 7 cent raise."
bad,Changing things almost everyday. No work life balance. Higher up pay is bad. Medical is bad. Management is bad. People that work there are amazing people and work very hard with no reward.
bad,"Management has unreal expectations for work that can be accomplished during a given day. pay is poor, and you will be frequently called in on your days off."
bad,"Work with not so good hrs, sometimes even full time but you have to clock out before 40 so they don’t have to have you as full time employee. Sometimes low on employees (cause they sent them home) and you have to pick up work for those missing people."
bad,"once you start working and they see you working hard, your hours will get cut regardless. they need to meet their quota and don't care that you're a human being, they want money and will fire people or cut their hours if you underperform or overperform"
bad,"When a store decides it doesn't need security after a string of thefts, you probably need a new place to work. Management was atrocious, training was minimal, and pay was paltry. Seriously, find somewhere else, this is barely above fast-food work."
bad,"Everyday you would clock in, work, break, clock out. That was it for 2 years. You are replaceable and it could be for anything. The only good thing about it was the discount."
bad,"If you are okay with working only 15 - 20 hours a week for easy money then this place is okay. When November through December come around, the job gets very stressful and there are no black out days. Expect to work on every holiday, and they try to advantage of most employees by making you work full time, but mark you down as part time to avoid giving you vacation and benefits."
bad,"I worked the night shift, and I wasn't too comfortable with working 6PM-3AM. Something I wasn't happy to get used to but the pay was good. I was responsible for packing boxes and shipping them onto the trucks to be delivered."
bad,"Typical day for a perishable assistant is to arrive in the middle of the night prior to store opening. Requires working in various temperatures, < 45 degree temperatures and poor hand protection to climate. Hardest part of the job was repetitive motions and hands freezing due to handling frozen and refrigerated items with poor gloves. Multiple tasks, not enough hours or manpower to complete everything unless you give 200% of your energy to every task. Constant organizing of backstock and checking every item for expiration. Many crew members don't listen or have bad attitudes. Poor management, with little knowledge of the tasks that need to be done and the amount of time it takes to do them."
bad,"Other stores might have a better experience than 1840. Avoid working there at all costs. The management is terrible and will work you to death. I hope it gets better for the future but for now, good luck those who work there. I could go on but don't want this to be fully negative."
bad,Manger  was  jealous of me seeing a coworker  he like  and  i didn't know tell after i already went on a date with the other coworker was pulled to the side and  threaten to  give my 2 weeks notice  or  be fired cause of this jealousy.
bad,I would say this is a decent first-time job but not somewhere anyone should plant their feet. It is a typical retail experience. Average not above or below its competitors.
bad,Management made every employee feel not good enough for the job. All the managers talked bad about other employees. The work place was full of drama. They didn't treat people fairly.
bad,In a typical shift at target I would serve customers and tidy the store. I recently went on a once in a life time trip with my family to Canada and LA. After I notified them for the 3rd time through kronos my mother was called and old that she should cancel our trip. I had previously told them in the interview and then when the manager came back from maternity leave.
bad,"Target used to be a great place work, but not so much any more. New management and unreasonable expectations have made it an unfriendly corporate culture to be in."
bad,The Job Is Okay But Management Is Not On A Professional Level. I would avoid working for any target company's. the hardest part about working at target is being able to get management to understand your situation and lifestyle.
bad,"do not apply if you arent a morning person. I have worked there for 3 years and like any job, your experience depends on management and your time. slow people affect you and management forces you to work harder to compensate. I wouldnt complain but I went from a steady 20 hours a week to 8 hours a week with bi weekly pay so it wasnt worth it. if you need a steady income do not apply"
bad,"managers and team leaders have their own set of politics which lead to nepotism. there was no fairness in job related field, they show favors to employees they have taken a liking to."
bad,I slipped and hurt my ankle and then was let go as a seasonal employee shortly after... I was also sexually harassed by a fellow team member and the incident was never dealt with.
bad,"It was great at first, good pay and a good amount of hours. Now we get 4-19 hours per week. Do they not realize that we're also human and have bills too!? Management is okay I guess. There's one HR that is always mad and gives attitude. I wish we would get more hours."
bad,Target is one of the most horrifying experiences I ever had. It is a very boring and stressful job. People watch you as though you are gonna steal and work. The pay and raises suck.
bad,"Target was awful to work with, management was always so mean. No opportunity for advancement unless you became a favorite of the management. It was just plain awful."
bad,"Was lied to from the start of the job, was easy work until higher ups asked you to do the impossible at times and expected you to finish things alone when they were two man jobs."
bad,I worked a seasonal job for them.  I was given kudos by management and yet after black friday was let go no help or assistance to get a job with them.
bad,I really do not know what to place here other than it was a retail bombshell. Workers were very underappreciated an stressful and go little to no relief from management.
bad,"On closing shifts you never knew what time you would get off"
bad,"I know better now.... don't be fooled by any leadership position with this company. Each position is 95% manager-on-duty and 5% for your core role. I came in with all of these great ideas on how to turn around the apathetic culture at my location, but there was never any time to put them into action because I was too busy stocking shelves, taking out the garbage, babysitting behavior problems, cleaning up spills, loading up coolers, moving clearance merchandise, and dealing with customers who were way too serious about their coupons. Be prepared to work up a sweat on a daily basis and then wait for your STL to ask why you're not staffing the store, why you're spending an entire day on the schedule, and why don't you know how to set and endcap. Definitely not anyone's definition of an HR position."
bad,Management has steadily been declining over the years. There are fewer and fewer people with any degree of competency suitably equipped to lead. It's disappointing that there is absolutely no upward mobility at this company. Morale is at an all-time low.
bad,"Unless you are offered a prestigious position or desperately need money to support yourself and your family, don't do it. There are next to no opportunities to advance within the company no matter how hard you work."
bad,If they get a good management team they will be ok the management they have now is inexperienced at there job and dont know what to do or how to handle the companys busimesd
bad,"Target, like many big chain stores nowadays, likes to hire a lot of part-time employees and give them very few hours to avoid paying anyone a living wage or giving them reasonable hours. Scheduling was inconsistent, management was too occupied with vying for the next pay raise, and the work was spread too thick over too few people on a single shift. Often I was expected to be doing three people's jobs at once. It was the most exhausting time of my life. And when my time with the company was up, they only let me know by no longer scheduling me. As a temporary employee, my schedule wasn't online, so I came in for THREE WEEKS to see if I was scheduled and I wasn't. And no one replied to my emails asking about this. 2/5 only because I liked my co-workers a lot. They were all very supportive and helped where my very little training failed me."
bad,I love working there people were great  I would recommend people  I learned alot how to be patient with people good customer service.  The hours were good at times.  At times it was a fast pace environment but over all it was ok
bad,You learn great customer service skills but management is horrible at some locations and the overall environment was less than ideal. Not the best teamwork. Tense environment at some locations.
bad,Target managers will recite policy through their mouths but behind the scenes will violate the same policies. If you get injured they will fail to support you.
bad,This company under pays certain positions like security officers and backroom employees. The company is quick to let go of hard working individuals and keep the under paid quiet employees.
bad,Management was a nightmare. Massive time constraints that would eat up your 15 minute breaks (2 per night). coworkers rarely cleaned up after themselves and management would reprimand the one person assigned to clean up crew.
bad,"The managers do not reward great behavior or hard working team members with normal rewards such as pay raises, advancement, or time off approval. Managers focus on hitting sales numbers only,"
bad,"The job itself was easy, the people you had to deal with weren't. Target is what it is, supplemental income, which is the complete opposite of the ""Target Family"" they love to talk about. Current management is a complete failure, along with their hiring habits (constantly choosing the less skilled for their submissive traits). However, Target pays on time and is a reliable source of low income."
bad,"Hours are sporadic at best working mornings, middle of day or late nights. Some days 4 hr shift other days 8 or 9 hrs. Never was a week with steady 40 hrs or same shift times. Expected you to stay if closing and restock items found in different areas to the right spots. Didnt tell you up front this. Expected you to know this apparently. Left first few closing shifts at the end of my scheduled shift without this knowledge so was frowned upon. During the holidays, "" guests"" are extremly rude and your expected to smile & take it & help em. For the pay...was totally not worth the hassle of staying. Management seemed like they couldn't handle even the most troublesome guests without getting the verbal abuse themselves. Wouldn't recommend this retail job unless you like the verbal abuse & disrespect that comes along with it."
bad,Bad place to work due to lack of job advancement and bad management that seem to make judgement calls based on favoritism. Breaks were too short as well.
bad,"PROS:"
bad,"The management for the store I worked at could careless about their employees and showed it everyday we worked. They did not convey schedules correctly which caused some days to be understaffed, the would not adjust your schedule for schooling, managers pressured you to complete transactions in less than 3 minutes even if you had to deal with over 50+ items. Fast, Fun, and Friendly they called it."
bad,Management doesn’t care about anything except their bonus!  They never hire full time and will cut employees hours down below 20 hrs a week and yet still continue to hire new employees so hours get cut even more!
bad,Atypical workday consisted of customer service and lots of time on your feet.  managemnt did not focus on company standards unless there was a corporate visit  .
bad,"When I first started my job in cosmetics, I would come in do my work and not be bothered. Recently management was changed and my job has changed. I am constantly told to do things that are not cosmetic related. My hours get chopped frequently and they only give me nights even though I have been there for almost two years and I have open availability. This is an entry level job but it has taught me a lot. It has taught me how to work with people you like or don't like and also taught me a lot about one on one customer service. My job isn't hard at all. What bothered me the most was that I was constantly taken out of my department to do other things. Targets big moto is to work as a team. I felt like it wasn't team oriented at all. I felt like is was managers versus team members. It was like high school all over again. Managers will talk bad about you behind your back. The only part I liked about my job was my fellow team members. They made the day enjoyable. The managers belittle the team members and talk down to us. My fellow coworkers and I are always being looked over when there is a promotion available and give it to someone who is not a hard worker. I would recommend this job as an entry position. If you are older, and have retail experience this place isn't for you."
bad,As a cashier most of the time you were thrown on a lane and forgotten about. They would have you working past your scheduled hours. Communication with time off was always more complicated than it had to be. Lots of people were favored over others.
bad,"No hours. If you don't work, you don't eat. I couldn't afford to eat so I chose to move on to a company that paid more money.  The working conditions were not the best either, but a job is better than no job at all."
bad,"Under compensated, No real advancement opportunities, lots of grunt work and physical labor for little pay. Dealing with boxes constantly.  During busy stretches you have crawl over and around things just to get at something. Not to mention having to move half a dozen things just to do one thing. No room to do things. Unfair work load between departments and levels"
bad,"This job is good if you go to school or for those that are self employed and need/want insurance. The shift that works best for that is the A1 shift. Which is Sat-Sun-Mon 6am-6pm. The work isn't bad, but there are limited opportunities for advancement and the only raises are automatic. So there is no incentive to work harder than required. They also do not treat employees very well at all. In my opinion the insurance isn't good. It used to be a lot better and is better than nothing, but its a Health Reimbursement Account style insurance."
bad,I elect not to answer this question - and I would like to pass on this question at this time.  Target was not a fit for me and the balance of work and life outside of work.
bad,Target is a great company to work for.  It's a great job for someone who is going to school. They have tuition reimbursement and are flexible with a school schedule.
bad,"Worked for the company for about 2.5 years and never was I given an opportunity to move up in the company despite the fact that I was the one who would place all the orders, training, and supervising of the entire team. If you are going to apply for this job, be prepared to never take breaks, always have someone watching your every move, and to be left alone with a line for more than 4 hours. "
bad,Overall experience was ok; poor corporate management though. Management kept cutting down working hours so we use to get lot of hours cut down on frequent manner.
bad,"Retail is not the best industry, Target doesn't make it better. Executives don't care about team members, just numbers. HR was there to just CYA. Very untrustworthy management team but corporate forces them to turn into that. Empty promotional promises. Guest are always right, even when they are wrong. Middle management has executive tasks but PT pay. The team made it tolerable."
bad,"there were no benefits, constant observation by a senior person to ensure that things were done precisely the way they wanted them that day.  chewed out because I took a 16 minute break instead of a 15 minute break.  switched from departments on a regular basis, making it difficult to learn particulars about assigned department."
bad,"Working with Target was not a good experience. I don't understand how most the people I worked with have been there for 10+ years. With NO promotions. If you're ""good"" you get a 15 cent raise every year. They need to hire more people because they will just throw you into whatever area they want even if that's not your job. They play favorites and you have to work weekends,holidays and if you're in school you will get no hours. Also very boring and you don't need to use your brain so you will feel drained after a full day. And everyone is so nosey and in your business."
bad,I worked in Logistics at Target and our hours were 4am-Noon and it was very taxing on the mind and body. The lighting in Target was so bright it gave me headaches and management would always be following people to make sure everything was getting done at a fast pace.
bad,"target is an environment that feels very much so similar to a type of boot camp. the managers hover over you as you work and the way they talk, give criticism, and converse with the employees is belittling. the labor they ask of you is yet very easy but they push you to the point of your highest efficiency to make they're numbers look beyond avg. I never worked for an employer(not a temp agency) that has shortened work for its workers and send them home early as if they don't have families nor obligations to fulfill. a big no for employment here."
bad,Pay was low for amount of work load done as well as the pay raise. Management did not work with employees to help them succeed and would pay unfairly based on work advancement.
bad,The managers are not supportive in any way.  They look for reasons to fire you if they do not like you.  The workers gossip and tell lies on each other. it is the worst work environment I have ever been in.  the pay isn't worth it and the benefits are awful.
bad,"At this Target, I have learned how to interact with customers in a fast and friendly way and also how to de-escalate situations when necessary. I have also learned how to work in tandem with other employees to complete tasks."
bad,"Wasn't treated with respect, terrible management. The higher up employees make it clear that they are better than you. You get paid $10 an hour yet it's not enough to put up with them treating you with respect."
bad,Worked there many years only to see the whole place fall apart and the people doing the grunt work got blamed for it all. False promises and flat out lies to get you to stay. Wanted so much for this to be as amazing as the training videos showed. Sorely disappointed. Only plus side were the personalities of the other hourly workers who were treated poorly as well. So sad.
bad,work day starts with the truck unload which can vary depending on how many employees they have and break is only called when the truck is finished which for some people can mean a 15 minute break after 3 hours of work. Management expects a lot out of each team member even when the store is understaffed and is somewhat disconnected to the process in general and have no communication with each other leading to one team member being told 2-7 different things from 2-7 team leads. The benefits of target are mediocre and its an easy job when the team leads let you do your job and they are somewhat lenient with vacations.
bad,Managers overloaded you with work to do but did not provide appropriate help to complete tasks in the time allotted. Would then hold you accountable for things you had no control over despite you going out of your way and above and beyond to make sure everything was completed.
bad,Hired part time for holiday season working 35-40 hours per week. Management cut hours down to 15 per week after holidays. Worked evenings and was held over after closing hours for nearly an hour every night without asking nor any consideration for employees responsibilities outside of work.
bad,"They assign you a shift, which is pointless because at any given moment they can come tell you that you have to come in and work overtime the next day. It is much more an as needed position though they advertise it as being a steady schedule. Horrible for parents with young children."
bad,I worked at the Cobb Parkway location here in Atlanta and while I really enjoyed my job the manager I had to deal with was unprofessional and childish. I was only there 2 months before they started with me with he/said she/said and I went to HR and a week later I was fired. most of my mangers were professional but one in particular is a mean and malicious heffa. they pushed redcards more than taking care of the guest and made us feel bad if we didn't meet a quota!
bad,n okay place for your first job if you need something on your resume. A typical day at work is hectic especially on the weekends. The workplace is quick pace but the constant hounding to get a red card and being told you might terminated if you don't get one soon is aggravating.
bad,"The supervisors,district leaders and etc don't care about their employees, the only thing that matters to them is sales. Team Leaders walk around text all day, but yet tell team member their aren't allow to have their phone out. The communication is poor. Every month they decide to try a new process without properly training team member and we are forced to adapt to it. The hours are given to only the team members they like the most. My leader only speaks if they want something done or something is wrong. We get raises once a year and the highest raise is like 50 -75 cents"
bad,this was my first job and I was honestly miserable! hours were good the paycheck was nice but the environment sucked! managers were always down your neck about something nothing was ever good enough to them. discount was trash too.
bad,"We were given unrealistic time requirements which caused lots of stress, most co workers knew little to no English, management didn't know what they were doing, and no matter how hard I worked it was never appreciated even though I never missed a day of work and worked sick for 2 months"
bad,I been learned how to stock everything right and be completed tasks on time. Help unload from trucks with a team and help to put stuff in store. Clean the floor in backroom
bad,I have worked for Target for going on three years now. I started out at the then base pay and have received a review and a couple cents of a raise over the course of my time there. I have worked hard everyday and continue to there.
bad,Hours are always cut in the logistics side of Target. The only time you get hours is around the holidays. But then during the holidays the supervisor expects a lot more from you than usual.
bad,Target for my first employer was good. They provide free dinners and pay at a decent rate depending on where in the country you are. For their full time employees they offer decent benefits. However they tend to skimp on the employees who actually need the benefits and hours. The management can be a bit stingy and biased.
bad,"putting out reshop, folding tables, answering phone, helping guest, pushing truck, doing work load, going up for back up, helping other departments like having huddles"
bad,The store that I worked at overall was a decent place. Most of the workers were great to work with. The Team lead for the truck unloading was a very rude woman that nobody wanted to deal with and that alone made you not want to go to work to deal with her.
bad,"Very productive and most staff do help one another and work very hard. "
bad,Management was a complete mess. Hours were terrible and pay was not acceptable either. Too many higher ups trying to push more work on their employees without offering to help
bad,My interviewer flat out lied that anyone who wanted 40 hours a week could get it. Don't expect to get the hours or shifts you want until you have several years seniority. The pay is a little above minimum wage but because of the scheduling it'd be hard to get a 2nd job.
bad,"management needs some serious cleaning out and maybe should take some classes on hey other people have families, other team members were great usually but sometimes had people who wouldn't wanna work or would just leave whenever they wanted to, the uniform was irritating because it was always incredibly hot and you had to have on pants, need to be better about disabled people as well because working there was rough, no consistency in schedule and for three months up until my wedding i was working 1-2 shifts a week and then the week right before my wedding i was working almost 30 hours and every single day aside from one"
bad,The environment at Target is awful and the pressure to get employees to sign up for Red Cards was insane. The managers were unethical in their desire to get the most customers to sign up for credit cards.
bad,"The first three years I worked with Target were great but there was a paradigm shift and now management doesn't hold the to what made the company."
bad,"Poor management and always cut throat about RedCards. They push and push you to get RedCards, but never give you any compensation for it besides a cheesy ""Hey blank got a RedCard!""."
bad,"Always trading your shifts . Or changing shift without notice . Over Worked and underpaid , management was okay at best, for the most part I wouldn't work there again ."
bad,"Very rigid, not disability friendly, thoughtless, overwhelming, very well organized, not friendly hard to get time off let go after a panic attack but said it was because I was late"
bad,"A typical day was arriving early and depending on which LoD was on shift, if you actually clocked in on time or late. Being told how to do the job correctly and then over a period of time and change of management, being told to skip this and that to save time and cram more stuff.  Being told that ""We are a Family"" and learning that the only ""Family"" is the core or ""Leadership"" part of management and not the regular hourly staff. After a Store-wide salary increase to match that of a Competitor, many of the long time employees of Target had their weekly hours cut, forcing them to look elsewhere so that Target could hire new employees at a lower hourly wage."
bad,The store in which I worked at had very poor management towards the end of my employment. my team lead and LOD's ( managers on duty) gave no support to the team and departments in which they over looked and at some times made the jobs of a lot of workers much harder do to the poor decisions they made.
bad,Didn't enjoy working there. Start off as temp worker basically and on a probationary period of 90 days before can receive benefits. Management horrible.
bad,"Typical retail. Bad hours, unqualified employees and even worse management. Results, good judgement and hard work are not valued. I was expected to never take my vacation time."
bad,I could not wait to go home every day. I was extremely disappointed in how managers treated team leaders and team members. They also did shady things to employees they did not favor.
bad,Working flow was automatically just bad hours and no advancement what-so-ever. All of management was terrible as well. The ETL had no idea how to run the team and we were always behind because of him and then he would yell at all of us for not working quick enough.
bad,"I only work for target for about 2 months before I was fired for taking a ""extended vacation"" but in fact I was visiting a loved one on their death bed.. I called out of work the night before letting them know I would not be in a for a weekend for I had to make an emergency trip out of town due to the fact my close relative was in the hospital not doing well at all.. after I returned to work from dealing with funeral expensive etc. I was fired for taking an ""extended vacation. I re-explained what happened and they did not care I was still fired.. I drove about 45 minutes to get there and as soon as I walked in and clocked in I was fired and had immediately turn back and go home."
bad,"not many customers to work with, and management and co-workers were only nice to workers when customers were not around."
bad,"This particular target that I worked for had horrible management, no leadership, and poor communication throughout the company. The hardest part of this job was waking up at 4:00"
bad,pay rate is low even if you have experience. no room for advancement. can only become an ETL if you have a BA degree. less hours to team members while summer help gets the most hours.
bad,Target provides a fair starting pay that quickly reaches its maximum. The company demands increased performance from its employees while not matching the pay to the increases. The company promotes an open door policy but does not implement or tolerate any suggestions to improve employee morale or benefits. Management provides dictator like interaction with employees.
bad,"fast pace,team member are friendly,management is a revolving door they don't stay more than a year or two.no stable hours some days only 4 hour shift, hard to make a full time job."
bad,"i extremely disliked the management, the other employees were fun to be around but the management went out of their way to make sure we never did anything for each other"
bad,"I started working here for extra income through the holidays and a little more.  It was an easy job, I liked talking with the customers.  It was disheartening to see how much people steal."
bad,Don't ask for the manager she's rude and the team members are perverts and also rude and the store management is un organized.personally my supervisor rich was the only person I enjoyed working with
bad,"Target is a great company with lots of amazing people working in it, but really, the best people are the guests that shop there! Guests are usually always polite and kind, and enjoy casual conversations. It makes for the best shifts."
bad,The managers were unorganized between each other and causing problems throughout the staff. I was almost written up for trying to take my graduation date off. So i quit
bad,"You are treated like absolute garbage there by upper management and certain Target staff, because you aren't technically target, Target doesn't treat you very well they treat our company like a bunch of outsiders that they don't want in there home. Also upper management is corrupted, rude, and inconsiderate. They look down on you, treat you like your nothing, no matter how much you contribute to the company it doesn't mean anything to them, they cut your pay and hours and change your title just because they don't want to pay fulltime hours, they ignore your scheduling needs, no matter how many times you say you cant work a certain shift or day because you are not available or because you live out of town or whatever you reason may be, they don't care and they will schedule it for you anyway and say that your s.o.l even though your availability says exactly what you need. They will change your schedule in the middle of the week without notifying you, or ask your permission and if you don't frequently look at your schedule you're screwed. Basically that place is terrible and I would NOT recommend working there. In store management with target mobile/tech is great and so are target mobile/tech workers, that was the only thing that kept me going for so long, but sometimes after enough garbage is dumped on you enough is enough."
bad,Target doesn't not enough hours for the number of workers they hire. Employees doesn't have any job security. Hours are given to the same people all the time.
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Target. It was a seasonal position and I am glad that is all it was. I hate asking people, ""Can I help you find something?"" I think that is the dumbest thing ever (to be asking continuously to every customer). And the red in the store... don't even get me started - makes me angry."
bad,"The training is adequate at best."
bad,"Job was seasonal and happy that was it. Job required lots of physical labor with no regards to employees, weak management, no room to advance. Was all about numbers, and no real time to interact with coworkers. Office personnel were treated much better."
bad,"Talk about a poor management corporation. No room for advancing from within unless you're there for 10+ years basically. If you're young with a business degree, you're hired on the spot. I just hope you have more knowledge then most."
bad,"Work more and get paid less.Target says they promote from within, but they hire fresh college graduates with no work experience to be executive team leaders over team members and team leader who are more qualified. Only work here if you want to jump through hoops to advance or don't mind being stuck."
bad,Target corp can offer good hours and job advancement.you have to make sure you are always on your toes.and have great customer service skills as well.you can have fun but can be overwhelmed as well.good pay you make friends and get all the necessary experience you need for a retail setting.
bad,"the work was good, worked well with other flow team members.  Team leads came and went on a regular basis.  Upper management did not communicate with all ream members, especially the night crew.  When new team leaders came in they were not notified that I have some medical limitations such as the inability to climb ladders, carry more than 50 lbs, can not stand still long periods of time, and have difficulty working more than 32 hours a week.  This is due to an injury to my right leg and knee, including insertion of titanium rods.  This caused friction and an even more hostile environment when I reminded them of my limitations."
bad,I personally would not work at target . Ever again . Management is unorganized . That's so unprofessional . They don't back you up or follow through with you .
bad,"Worked there for 22 years and they closed saying they couldn't afford to keep the distribution center open, yet they turn around and build a brand new stadium for the Minnesota Twins. Offered me to transfer to another state with hired cost of living at same pay rate."
bad,I would only recommend working here short term or as a job to help you get through school. The work itself is not difficult but the poor management can make it unbearable at times. country to what they say the will not be very flexible with your schedule. My days consist of me cleaning the  entire back half of the store because HR has driven everyone else away and we are short staffed.The team is very friendly however and it is easy to get along with. When your actually allowed to interact with them that is.
bad,"My first Experience with Target in San Jose Ca was AMAZING!"
bad,RED CARDS RED CARDS RED CARDS. That's all they care about. Your skill and ability as an employee doesn't matter if you're not meeting your Red Card sign up quotas which are very unrealistic.
bad,"while working at target, I was miserable. they was almost no one for promotion and lack of official cross training, The GSTLs were great and would help however the ETL only cared about surveys and redcards. i loved my coworkers while working. they are the only ones that got me through the day."
bad,"This could be a great company to work for except they do not award experience, simply looks and who can kiss the most behind.  If you have an opinion on how the managers can do something better, then it is recommended to keep it to yourself, as they will will take it as personal insult and do what they can to harshly critique until you listen to the management without question. There is also a lot of passing the buck instead of the people that need to take the accountability for failures, but the managers are quick to take credit for their employees successes.  When I started at this company it was much different. By they time I left it, they seemed to be going in the direction of wal-mart, and instead of setting people up for success, the leaders would do the opposite."
bad,I hate to but I have to be completely honest about target.. it is a very neat and friendly place to shop. On the flip side to work for target is horrible. The management is power hungry and the benefits are ridiculous. they wouldn't allow me to work fulltime after being there in many different departments. I wasn't eligible to receive their benefits because of that.
bad,"Management shows favorites, I worked through my 90 days and let me go , because in those 90 day's I only got them 4 Red Cards."
bad,They don't allow flexible schedule if you work in softlines if you not the team lead or brand you close all the time. They don't let you switch to another area. They are always on your back about getting red cards. They have favoritism if you don't suck up to them you basically like the black sheep there.
bad,"Not a bad place to work, however shifts were short, and there wasn't the number of hours promised. Sorry it had to close its operations in Canada."
bad,"Target compensates well for removing your ability to have work-life balance.  Would not recommend working here, especially with such high rates of turnover."
bad,"Nothing enjoyable"
bad,Everyday is the same here. With unrealistic goal times and expectations of doing several things at once.  Don't meet these expectations and goals and get penalized for trying your best but your best never being good enough. Plus work condition are horrible. They expect you to work at a fast pace all the while your losing at least a gallon of water from sweating with no relief of air flow to help keep you cool.  Management doesn't listen to any of your concerns even though they say they care when they actually don't. On top of all the work we do in one day we aren't being paid nearly enough.  With the current management working here will more then likely ruin your life. I could say more but that would require me writing a small book to tell you all the things wrong with this place. The only saving grace is your fellow teammates who are pretty fun and understand what your feeling because most of them feel the same way.
bad,"I rocked the job! Too bad the WOMEN managers had in mind which woman they wanted to include.(no good lookers) Must lift, sort, place, stock, breakdown boxes and recycle, then give a hand in other departments your so unworthy of, because no one wants to do grocery. They need people to do the ""no one wants them""  jobs. This was a seasonal position and your unaware of when it ends. They let ya know a couple shifts prior to your end date. I was not impressed. Insulted really! I put in extra hours every day that went on noticed when it came to hire or not time."
bad,I hate it working at Target. Management is the worst they do not know how to treat people what so ever. I would quit if i did not need to pay bills.
bad,I cashier for target almost everyday. I deal with different behavior on the regular. I'm very skilled at what I do. I help make sure that our costumers leave our store with a smile on their face every time. I also handle money as regarding the store making sure that no money has been reported missing. I love working with a team but when it comes to my job I make sure the job gets done.
bad,"First off let me point out i wasn't one of those lazy dudes who complain about the boss getting on them for moving to slow. In my brief period at Target a received the employee of the month award and an opportunity for advancement. I turned it down because I, plain and simple, hated that job. Co-workers where jerks, customers are very ungrateful, and the Managers, excuse my French, had their heads up their (insert choice word here). My advice, Apply somewhere else. There are plenty of jobs that pay better, and demand less."
bad,At target I serve as a front end team member. I have not really learned anything on the job. The management staff could be a lot better and friendlier.
bad,When i was full time working overnight and switched to dayside they would only give me 20 hours a week and i was guaranteed the same 32-40 hours a week. They continued to hire on people and tell me there was no work and that it would pick up eventually but it never did.
bad,This place has huge employee turn over. From bosses to employees on the floor. You will see people walk out and quit during shifts. You will destroy your body while working there. The bosses are usually around 25 years old and have no idea how the world works. I say avoid it
bad,"ETLs(management) is trained (brainwashed) to hustle every bit of your soul. You will be overworked and underpaid. If you work too hard they will only take advantage of that and label you as a sucker. As team sucker you're  rewarded with more workload while the lazy people mock you and float through the day without doing anything. Nevertheless, you will find comfort in knowing that your hard work will not pay off because Target doesnt promote hardwork. Supervisors are selected based on workplace politics and the fact that the ETL and supervisor are secretly cousins. It's okay because you'll go to school and better yourself; unless an ETL finds out and systematically set up your schedule during your class hours. How dare you try to better yourself. New people aren't told about their second break or the fact that they don't have to work past scheduled time...but slave on because everyone loves Target."
bad,pay is decent but work life balance is not there. with more work life balance the job would not be so stressful at times. the graveyard shift is the worst shift to have.
bad,no comment on Target and the culture it promotes. The company has things it needs to work on to improve its work environment for part time employees
bad,"It all depends on the management team you have in the Target stores. If you have the right mix of managers working together with the right store team leader, you will have a great experience. If you have the wrong mix of leader, then you are in trouble. I worked in two target stores. The first one was wonderful. Great store leader and the other leaders were good also. The second target store, it started off really well, until a major shake up of management happened and every thing went horrible."
bad,"Made adjustments to product lines as directed"
bad,"I don't have to much to say about this company, but they do offer a wide range of diversity to different groups beliefs.I dont want to work there again. I did this position while i was finishing school."
bad,Upper management treats TM like a slave and all the TL and ATLs act like they are in a cult and do not try to connect with TM. (as if they are too good to be near the likes of a lower level worker) They constantly talk down to you and will fire you for unknown reasons if they don't like you. They will bully you to the point where you wanna leave and where you develop anxiety problems.
bad,I was employed at Target almost 11 years ago. At the time I was a single mom. I constantly explained to my boss that I needed at least 20 hours a week to be able to afford all of my bills and provide for my child. I was getting between 10-15 hours per week. After a few months of struggling I talked to her about getting a second job because I was unable to pay my rent. She told me that I was not allowed to have a second job and couldn't accommodate a schedule change at this time. So I really felt like I had no choice but to seek employment at a more stable location.
bad,"hated it, job was boring and management harassed employees and customers about redcards. Would not go back to this store ever again."
bad,"Target use to be a great place to work.  In the last five years, poor decisions from corporate management have led the company down a slippery slope.  The Target Canada expansion was a disaster!  The American stores are the ones that are paying for that blunder.  Reduced hours and increased workloads.  Leadership that is more concerned about doing what's best for themselves rather than what's best for the store.  Negativity permeates through out. Stores' morale is at an all time low.  It's heartbreaking to see what this company was to what it's become."
bad,"not very fond of the job, i felt more like a number than a human being. management can be rude at times, depends on who your manager is. nobody really talks to everyone, its more on the line of you hang out with the person thats in your department"
bad,"A typical day at Target always consists of assisting guest, providing a clean workplace, and making sure your job gets down. Team Leaders and Leader of Duty knows you by name and are always there to lend a helping hand of advice."
bad,"I have alot of skill in this field and am not considered because of my age.Look around the store some time,everyone is under 40.I feel thats age discrimination!"
bad,"TARGET is a bad place to work. Large retail stores like this tend to hire for a few months, treat their employees poorly, and then kick them to the curb so they don't have to give raises. The happy new job feel will be gone within the first month and managers will argue in front of you about what they want you to do. If you are on the edge of applying here, just don't. You are worth more than the way they will treat you, and even fast food will be much more enjoyable than working at this place."
bad,"The store that I'm currently working at is struggling. It's poor upper management choices is transparent in its lower workers. Many,at least 5 including HR, has left the company in the last two months. Their reasons are similar to my own reason, lack of hours and poor treatment of its employees. An example of this might be despite labor being low, they refuse to schedule cashiers. As a result Sale Floor Members now spend at least a hour of they shift back up cashiering, a secondary responsibility. Thus, we get hours behind in our work. Lately, to the put that the backroom has to put away OUR carts of merchandise from the backroom to the sale floor. The domino effect continues as backroom falls behind in their work."
bad,"Target is always a good job for somebody who just started working somebody young ,but the mangers & team leads are terrible ! If you are ever having a problem keep it to yourself because they won't stick up for you !  Worst job I've ever had"
bad,Target is great company if you want to get hired on store level but on the corporate side its hard to advance into different jobs unless you transfer to a store first.
bad,"The pay as a supervisor was not worth it. I worked as a GSA, and i was only paid 50-75 cents more than a cashier, but the workload was extremely different. I resolved guest issues, managed breaks/lunches, opened/closed front end of store, collected money from every register and replaced starting fund. Very fast paced environment in a place where management didn't even follow policies, but were rather more concerned about guest satisfaction. The only thing that made my job bearable was the people who I supervised. They were amazing people to work with (except management of course). Sometimes I felt that I was being pulled in different directions. I was told to do one thing, but once it was done, was questioned about it. Cashiers were recognized for opening red cards, but supervisors were not given any recognition for driving them to open red cards to begin with."
bad,"No promotion opportunities for a pharmacy technician. Phones shut off during pharmacist's lunch, so that's a plus. Still a lot of corporate BS, regardless of how ""fun"" they try to make the work environment."
bad,"Too Demanding"
bad,"Target was pleasant in the first year but then after it all goes down hill. Raises are based off your yearly review and would consist of 5 cents to a max of 20 cents. Management is HORRIBLE. Most of the executive team leads belittle and look down on you. They care less of the team's well being. As long as you get their dirty work done, then they will probably consider you. Overall its an ""okay"" company to work for. Would not recommend. Its good for a part time to make extra money during the holidays."
bad,"Typical day at work:"
bad,"It was good work, not very hard, a lot of repetitive work, some unnecessary. The job consisted of  restocking store items, cleaning up the store after the days business restoring it to a clean and orderly manner once more, this was done every night 11pm to 3;30 am. We would pull pallets from the receiving area to appropriate section of the  store,then place merchandise on the on pallets to the isles in which they went in the section the were the merchandise was located."
bad,Would not recommend for those who are trying to balance education with part-time work. There is a rampant lack of honesty and integrity among management and a complete lack of concern with employee's situations.
bad,"Target, well at least my store is a good place to work if you work part time you get at least 35 hours per week but its hard to hours that comply with your availability and managers do not communicate with each other or team. HR doesn't help you they only care about the company. management does not recognize good work and hard effort. management pick on people who don't stand up for themselves such as older ladies and people who don't speak fluent english. its hard to get to move work centers because  my store rarely hires. management abuses power and threatens to fire you if you do not comply with your schedule even if your not trained or titled for a position fro which your scheduled. they pressure you to force people to sign up for target credit card and lie to people to persuade them to sign up for it"
bad,I did not enjoy working at target. Most of the employees were unhappy working there and it showed in their performance. The managers seemed lazy and inattentive.
bad,"A typical day at work is restocking,dealing with guests,and cashiering often. I learned to multitask better and to keep a smile on my face no matter what the problem. There are to many levels of management. Co workers tend to ban together and help each other out. Hardest part of the job is dealing with angry guests and management. The most enjoyable part is how flexible they are with scheduling for school."
bad,"Not a good place for engineers.  Too much touchy-feely, have a relationship team building and not enough accountability to make sure people are doing their jobs and being held accountable."
bad,"It can be very stressful at times but i work with a great time....my experience grew, now i know how to deal with people much better....some of the target ETLS are good others just i did not care much about them, they can be very rude at times, specially my new STL....does not know how to deal with people.......lately the only reason i go to work is because of my co workers, they make day enjoyable."
bad,"been too long to remember much, didn't get enough hours, liked making the monthly newsletters, made the weekly back up cashier schedule"
bad,"Work day was routine, 3-5 hours for logistics for 3 days a week."
bad,not very professional. staff were difficult to work with. no benefits or comensation. inappropriate the way they treat clients.
bad,Horrible Communication and management. Always down talking employees and being extremely passive aggressive. They do not care whether you have a sick kid or you are dying.
bad,"When i was hired i was told that this wasn't a just a seasonal job and that i would have several opportunities to advance. At first i was excited to be apart of the team and everything was going smoothly. I gained a lot skills that i didn't have before since i had never worked in retail before. I was hired on to be apart of the flow team so i help unload the truck and put stuff away before the store opened. So as my 90 days was coming up there was a lot tension building around the store and i noticed that they where getting very strict on things that they where kinda lax on during the holidays. i didn't thing anything of the this because i thought i was doing a great a job. I came to work on time, I never called out and i was always in the correct uniform. well i came into work one morning thinking i was going to do the same thing i always do which is to unload the truck. Little did i know I was going to get fired or laid off. the entire conversation was very confusing and i didn't really get a clear cut answer as to why i was getting fired other then i was within my 90 days. What really bothered me the most is that my team lead said it had nothing to do with my work ethics or me as an employee. So why did i get fired? I have never been fired like this before or laid off whatever you want to call it. It was just an all around disappointment. I gave up a lot of other opportunities for this job because i thought it would be more permanent for the situation I am currently in. (I'm in the national guard and my husband is active duty)"
bad,way to pushy about their credit cards. they will scare their customers away trying to get them. little opportunity to advance. the best part about the job were the team members
bad,"Overall, Target was a good job. Made good friends, and essentially had a fun time working. "
bad,"Target (or at least my store) is not as focused on customer service as I would prefer. The focus of any store should be helping the customer have the best experience possible, not making your zone look perfect. Recovery is important, but it should always come after making sure all guests are satisfied."
bad,"Target is flexible with schedules,  unfortunately hours are cut at any given time.  Store has lack of training.  The pay is minimal.  regardless of experience."
bad,"I would only recommend Target for those seeking a temporary part-time job or seasonal job. It is not a healthy place to work, especially if you get sucked into the management culture."
bad,"The numbers at the target I worked at were among the best in the nation.  Unfortunately, that was because it was the busiest and right by campus.  Most days, the floor was slammed, and on sale days it was worse.  Cohesion between day side and night side was spotty at best, resulting in a perpetual game of catch-up.  As you can imagine, this made management exasperated, which in turn was passed down onto the general staff.  "
bad,horrible management. pulled in tons of directions. unethical. bad payroll management.
bad,"Target continues to hire very young inexperienced  middle management. These campus recruits are unstable and usually have no retail experience. Hard working people are not noticed, impossible to advance beyond frontline management positions, impossible to fire unproductive workers. Staffing inadequate to meet ""best practice"", much improvement is needed."
bad,"The management team of this corporation sorely lacks education, skills, and direction that should be expected in an international retail chain.  Providing only a bare bones staffing model, the management is constantly increasing the expectations on their team members; when the team meets the expectations, they cut hours even more, but do not decrease the expectations.  ""Expect more, Pay less"" is not only a marketing plan, but a management model."
bad,"ETL program is designed to find future executives from large pool of recent grads.  All others will be phased out within two years at most.  Turnover rate is extremely high.  ETLs are told that 50 hour weeks are minimum, but more is expected, especially during Q4.  Often worked 60+ hour weeks.  In-store management was good, but district management is there to serve as an intimidation factor, not a resource for ETLs to grow and learn from.  A lot of politics/ performing at the right times are what can bring quick advancement.  Being awful all year long but having good days when district management visit is enough to get on their good side and get on the fast track toward STL/District leadership.  ETLs usually end up working against each other instead of helping each other out since it is such a competitive program.  Good place to get people management skills right out of college since not many places will put a recent grad in charge of 50+ direct reports.  Pays well for entry level job as well but not when it is broken out by the hour."
bad,"A typical day of work consisted of cleaning restrooms every hour, fetching shopping carts while watching out for cars in the parking lot, helping customers with big items or too much items, taking out trash from trash cans all around the store, and cleaning spills mostly for other team members. I learned Cart Attendant is the lowest job title they have. When team members need help or when they are low on staff managers look for other people to fill in instead of stepping in themselves. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep your dignity when everyone is expecting you to be everywhere at once. If you need to be somewhere and call out, your hours are cut. Short breaks. Little to no promotions. Customers are highly entitled and Target encourages their customers to have that attitude. 5 to 20 cent yearly raises. The only enjoyable part of the job is collecting shopping carts in the parking lot on slow days. The solitude and beautiful days helped me maintain my sanity."
bad,"Typically guests are only allowed to try on 6 pieces of clothes at a time,which is actually the rule. Guests come up with 12, 13, even more clothes to try on, if the store manger is there, she allows them to take all of the items they want to try on it, which increase the chances of theft. Management seems confused. No one knows anything. Team members who has worked with the company know more than the managers. Co-workers are full of drama. It gave a high school feeling. The hardest part of the job was me not over working myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting guests leaving them happy."
bad,"A typical work day at Target includes ringing up guests and offering them Red Cards and keeping the front lanes clean and safe. Target's scheduling is inconsistent and changes daily and weekly, and the pay is low. Some of the upper management team seem to look down on the team members that are lower than them, some even go so far as to talk down to them. The other cashiers, GSA/GSTL's (Assistant Managers), and sales floor team members are great people however and have wonderful personalities."
bad,basic retail world of freight and customer service.My co-workers at the time were a lot of people i went to school with so it made it a more enjoyable experience.
bad,Honestly... WORST JOB EVER! It may have been the location I was at (atlanta) Buckhead to be exact! Management was terrible hours were not enough to make ends meet and pay was a joke! You work so hard only to be disappointed with every check. The only positive was our team was pretty close like family. It was just always too many demands from management and not enough people and instead of offering either more hours or more help we were left just to make do! After being promoted from a cashier they tried to keep my raise from me until I had to confront them about it!
bad,"Immature managers"
bad,Underpaid over worked. Commission is a joke. If they put you in a slow store you will lose your mind and you won't be able to pay bills.
bad,"they expect too much, youre physically done if you work too many hours in a week. fff days are cool if you're actually working. Etl's need a reality check but some are very approachable. Time off easy to obtain as long as you remain on good side of the people in charge. hours are really random not guaranteed."
bad,"merchandising jewelry and sunglasses at Target three times per week.  Management has very high expectations for wages paid."
bad,They staff wasn't friendly and the management isn't stable
bad,Pretty regualr retail job. Good for a young kid looking to build experience.
bad,"The managers let the ""trainers"" take over each department,  the trainers think they can do whatever they want. If you have a problem you go to the trainer not your manager or pharmacist.  Then nothing gets done and you get written up, the pharmacy talks about other workers and invades hipaa,  the pharamcist will do anything to get you out of there if he doesnt like you. They will write you up for the dumbiest stuff. Do yourselves a favor and dont work there!!!"
bad,"a very stressful environment, management took stress out on employees"
bad,"Target used to be a fun place to work at until the data breach last year and the opening of target canada.  Since then, management has change tremendously.  Target is now overworking their people, giving them only 4 hour shifts but scheduling them for 8 to 10 days in a row."
bad,"With 10+ years in the wireless industry I definitely know my product!"
bad,I was a cashier and in charge of the fitting room and phone. I had to transfer calls and help customers find certain items in different sections as well as clean up the store.
bad,management was poor and the work enviornmet was very stressful.
bad,"If you like standing on your feet, than this is the place to work.  When, I was asked to fill in when needed.  I was asked to work as a cashier until, someone clocked in.  It can be very stressful when standing, scanning merchandise then bagging within a short period of time."
bad,"Completed all cleaning, stocking and organizing tasks in assigned sales area"
bad,"First job, worked there for over two years. Enjoyed working there, the stucture was not the best."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is making people happy."
bad,"Although I was not expecting much from the position, I worked my way up to a hyper employee fairly quickly, as I already have a BA in History.  A hyper employee does double the work as a regular employee without a pay increase but a promise to be first in line for management.  That never happened and I was actually passed up for a promotion.  Lazy employees knew how to scam the system so that all the people that work hard had even more to do."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is usually pretty busy. We have our regular customers that come in all the time. I get along with all of my co-workers and all of the customers that come in. I always start conversations, and see how their days are going. "
bad,"-Everyone had to line and unload the truck with managers staring you down. Then you drag the items on large pallets back to your department and try to unload and stock everything under a strict deadline. "
bad,"Day as a Cart Attendant was pretty uneventful, spent most of my time looking for something to do.  Learned not everyone is trust-worthy.  No one in management had actually performed my job before so no one could help me when i needed it.  My former co-workers were pretty great always will to help if they could.  Hardest part would be rude people.  Talking with the nice people."
bad,"A typical day at Target working in the backroom includes completing your computer automated pulls in a timely manner, ensuring it gets to the sales floor promptly and put in the right place, and maintaining a clean and safe backroom. The biggest problem I had with this job is that a majority of your superiors are hired directly out of college right after graduation, with little to no retail experience, and because of their degree, feel that they know more about everything then you do, and look down on you for it. A decent place to earn minimum wage part-time, but nothing more than that. You can do better than Target."
bad,"Much of the time the management was focused on themselves and were unable to recognize issue within the workplace. This included but was not limited to assisting areas that did not have enough team members."
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work at target unless your in high school looking for a job, second job off to the side or just wanna get extra income. This is the worst company to work for; you will be treated nice at first then you will be treated like dirt the next year (if you make it). Target has a thing where they don't really care about you they just wanna make their money; get billions of dollars and if you work hard that whole year your gonna get a .50 cent raise or less; now how are you gonna feed your family; but if your young and wanna just get a some income till you get your school and career going no biggy then."
bad,"There is no teamwork, yet they call us team members. It's a, ""Fend for yourself"" enviroment. Team Leads do not know how to lead their team or work with their team to bring out the best in each and every person."
bad,"Target was very disappointing. They did not offer me the salary that was described from the first day of recruitment. also, the job duties were not the same as what I was informed of during the recruitment process."
bad,"Target is a great company for people in college. They work around your school schedule. Management is pretty good, and fellow team members keep you coming to work because they are fun to be around. However the hours are low and they pay is minimum for the work you do."
bad,"On a daily basis understaffed, and no relief in sight.  Management has no care for their employees.  If you have any issues, and you bring it up to the HR department, you are basically told without a flinch that ""it's the nature of the beast"" meaning retail.  There is no real problem solving here, only robots."
bad,I had the unfortunate luck to work at a Target that wasn't so great. The Managers didn't care about jobs being done wrong.
bad,The team members are great to work with. The worst part is the lack of work-life balance. High turnover management wise results in lack of interest and investment in your development.
bad,"Work is difficult, high speed is demanded and the risk for injury by repetitive stress, failing equipment, employee carelessness is higher than what a person might expect."
bad,"Unloading the truck was the best part of the day , working the stock was fast paste  managers were rude"
bad,"Work Load is more."
bad,"A typical day at work included Unloading trucks and stocking shelves for most of the early morning (4 am to 8am). In My case I would come in 30 minutes earlier as instructed and help the supervisor/manager with their work. Then after 8am stocking would continue if necessary and employees would assist guest that would arrive because store was open. Management for the most part were ill informed and under qualified to lead such a large team and often fell short of company goals laid out for them. Manage also placed unneeded pressure on team by poorly assessing talent and job parameters. I would often assume leadership role and assist in pushing team towards goals. Promotions were never given to early morning workers because no one came in early enough to witness ""promotion-worthy"" workers."
bad,there was always something to do. If you were a cashier you would probably end up on the floor and vice versa. Management wasn't so understanding or flexible with scheduling. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping guests in store and making them laugh and smile.
bad,Start work as soon as I enter and leave when everything is done.
bad,I think the only people who would be happy in this company are high school students who need the extra money. This company doesn't care about their employees.
bad,"It's a run of the mill retail job with almost no room for advancement to higher positions or a raise beyond 30 cents a year. Management is highly disorganized and disrespectful to its workers. There is no action done for improvements in worker safety, especially when it comes to truck unloads. If your looking for 40 hours a week, you have to constantly pick up shifts and get cross trained in other areas."
bad,target had somewhat great managerment and benefits was somewhat good
bad,If you just want a job its good for you but if you want advancement i would work somewhere else
bad,The management was horrible to work for but most of the people I worked with were nice and easy to work with. I enjoyed the job however.
bad,"make drinks, cash out guest, clean, management was not the greatest unless you brown nosed a lot you was on their bad side and that`s not me"
bad,"Not a good place too work.low paying poor management.expected"
bad,"I go into work at midnight to unload the truck. We then stock the store as quickly as we can. Normally still leaving at two or three in the afternoon. I learned how to handle situations when management is poor. My co-workers were hard working, and excellent. They all stepped up when they needed too. The hardest part of my job was having poor management. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers and the people I met."
bad,Constantly belittles employees and ignores all advances from employees to help better the work flow. Blames employees for incidents that happen on their days off just to fire them to hire in their own family (more managers than company but company backs them). Lowest paying retail job with no benefits.
bad,This job was easy. I loved my co-workers. There really wasn't any management. Was best part of the job was the comradery between my co-workers & I.
bad,"Working for Target in the early years was great fun but each time they changed management, rules and regulations changed. Each new manager bringing new ideals on ways to improve business."
bad,"This was a brand new store so I had the pleasure of setting up the isles and stocking them with merchandise. A typical night would consist of me arriving at late night hours to unload a truck, organize the truckload and set up merchandise."
bad,"When I first started working at Target things were good management knew how to treat employees and it was fun to go to work. Lately its become more about the company's bottom line and employees aren't being valued, which causes employees that have been with the company for decades to seek employment elsewhere."
bad,Target offered pension but terminates employees before 25 years of service.
bad,"all i can say about target is, they need alot of work done for their company bc if you arent in management....be expected to get worked hard for very little, and unappreciated for what you do."
bad,"The environment wasn't bad. However, the management had overly high expectations of new hires as well as a tendency to treat their employees as though they should make innumerable, unrewarded sacrifices for the company. They want automatons working the aisles, not people."
bad,The only way to advance in the company is to have a degree. If you start as Team Lead there is little to no chance of promotion to executive team lead.
bad,Maintaining my work area. Didn't really learn anything becuase this is not work work of interest. The hardest part of the job was ignoring the trouble makers of the company.
bad,"I started at Target when I was 16. They hired me the next day and after I had passed my drug screening which I found completely ironic, considering that most of the people who work there look like stoners, I was only promoted 3 times out of the 6 years. Looking back on it I could have taken things differently and said things nicer, but it came to a point when I found that being asked to stay late and pick up shifts, work 5 different work centers, all for the same amount of base pay was just plain stupid. I also went to college while I was working at Target. When I went to school I took a LOA or leave of absence and when I would come home from breaks I would work for a week or two and then return back to school. My work during that time period would never be factored into my annual benefits unless I called in, and I was never given a 90 day performance review so I could never receive a raise. After I had completed my 4 year degree in 4 years I thought Target would open me with open arms, I mean I had worked there loyally and now I had a college degree. I went to career fairs and approached them saying I had worked for Target already and now was looking for a management position and what could they offer me. However, I received nothing but silence. And even from my own store's HR and management staff, they said nothing. So I applied silently to another store in the state I went to school in. Yet again though I was shot down. Then I was told I would receive a small promotion even though I didn't even need a degree for it. I had to wait over a month to even know if that was going"
bad,This is where i got my start in retail. I learned a lot. Learned how retail really is about instocking to cooking to the people who drove the trucks.
bad,the best thing about working for target was my co-workers i loved my team well mangement was not all that in the 3 years that my store was open we had 3 store managers and 4 H.R the hardest part of the job was when you had to multi task and the best part of my job was my salesfloor team
bad,"When I was operator, I was required to manage the fitting room, answer all calls and transfer them respectively, and sort go back carts from guest services. Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot of good things when it comes to being an operator, and I am glad that I got the chance to have that experience. This particular Target is full of workers who think they are better than everyone else, and managers that pick favorites. When I developed a back problems, and asked them to only give me operator shifts, they said that they would not accommodate for me, and I still had to work the same way everyone else did. They said that my fellow co-workers thought it was not fair to them because they were not allowed to sit as much as I did, even though I had a doctors note. Due to my back issues, many of my co-workers started to make rude remarks to me and treated me completely different. There was also a lot of drama, so many of my co-workers didn't like each other, creating unwelcome tension. I would say that the hardest part of working there was dealing with the busy holiday seasons or the busy days. The management would get mad if you did not finish everything due to the fact that they thought we didn't have anything to do. They were not friendly, and it effected the moral of all the workers. They only part I loved about this job was interacting with different people. I would always be kind to every guest, and it would only take one person to turn around my day."
bad,"-Unloading the truck, and stocking the shelves"
bad,"a typical day could be very stressful at times, they would give you an amount of work that would sometimes be too much. If you would ask for help they would either ask you to stay and finish or come in on your day off. Most of the time i felt obligated to, even though i would have plans. The management would show favoritism to its team members. Also the management seemed to be very fake, because they would act one way to your face and another way behind your back, and more than once I've seen the management disrespect a team member in front of the whole team.The most enjoyable part of my day would be with my coworkers."
bad,"A typical day at Target invovled me standing around at a cash register for 8 hours, dealing with customers who thought they knew more than you. Just the way i was treated by management and customers, it wasnt worth it. I was glad to hear they were letting me go. Being hired for seasonal help, was pretty good, cause that means Im not there long. Overall, Im glad to be gone."
bad,While the coworkers are pretty nice the raises and advancement are pretty shady sometimes. Alot of times they would not even tell you if a position was open so you could apply. Advancement alot of times was based on friendship and not work. Management will talk about your personal info(why you called out etc).
bad,"Easiest job in the world. Unload trucks, stock shelves, backstock merchandise. Management and HR unhelpful. It's like high school with all the rumors and talking behind each other's back. Nothing is kept confidential. No way to move up without a college degree to be an ETL. If your a team lead you'll probably be stuck at that position forever unless a senior team lead leaves. Hardest part nothing. Most enjoyable some of the people you meet."
bad,"Trouble place to work. No room for advancement, trouble management and no open door policy."
bad,I think this job is good for those not looking to move up. It works for students. They don't pay enough for what they expect from you. I would recommend this job for those that are looking for a career.
bad,"I will say that I've been at this corporation for 2 and half years and I cannot say I recommend working here for any advancement opportunities, nor for any long-term employment. The hours always fluctuate, you never have a set schedule, and you don't have benefits unless you have 40 hours a week (which rarely happens and they do not like to pay for overtime) unless you were a favorite worker there then you could get things accustomed to your life. The management is spotty because you always have your good and bad ones, but these people like to believe what we do is very simple, but it's not. We often get talked to for not getting an area, that has been basically destroyed by guest traffic, done in time with other tasks we have to do. My coworkers are one of the only reasons why I stay besides that I need a job because they keep me going everyday and make me feel like I'm valuable and worth keeping. I don't want to make it seem like I'm bitter about working here, but I cannot help but to say that this isn't the best company to work for at all. Also there aren't many opportunities to move up unless you have some type of college degree, not for all the work you put in for the company itself and show you can do a better job."
bad,"Dealing on a busy sales floor with customers coming at you every which way, and your stock still hasn't been put out in the 2 sections one is working in. And then you are asked to cover the register. Some days where pure madness, but one is to get it all done with a smile on your face and what ever one can eat in 15 minutes. Or get written up by the ""team leaders"" who just stand over you as one struggles to meet the days requirements."
bad,Target provides a good work environment in which you are always busy. This is overnight work which provides an intimate working atmosphere. For the most part teamwork and cooperation is stressed at Target which makes working there fun.
bad,I was on the Flow Team that was overnight to stock the floor. work with great people in fort coolins then back to broomfield.
bad,"During my duration at Target, I realized there was alot of favoritism going around. Not many of the employees were treated fairly."
bad,A lots of hours even as a part timer. Have to fight to get schedule to work around school even when the holidays are different from other schools.
bad,alright place to work not enough hours. good people and good prices
bad,This was an okay job it wasn't very fast fun nor friendly. For the most part there are some nice people for this company.
bad,"Target's overall culture does not encourage one to be a free-thinker. It asks for input but only wishes to hear positive feedback, regardless of the viability of the project. In fact, Target punishes anyone who seeks to better the idea by providing accurate, constructive feedback that may be contrary to the company's perspective, by labeling you as not being ""Fast, Fun and Friendly"". What's more, Target does not appear to base their promotion practices on merit. They appear to base advancement decisions on how well someone ""fits the mold"", rather than based on accomplishments. They seek people that can ""talk the talk"" and not necessarily ""walk the walk""."
bad,Average ready to leave company has had to many changes over the last 15 years. Core teams have disappeared and team members are not monitored. Store is short on tools and supplies
bad,"The store had very poor management and they didn't care about the employees. I overhear many times, the managers talking bad about an employee. They did not give good hours one week I would have 30 hours the next I would only have 8. Co-workers were very nice, but aways talked bad about each other and made other workers cry. We did get good breaks and they always had food in the breakroom. I would not work there again or recommend it."
bad,Target is one of typical corps contract labor pay near nothing expect performance of regulare employee thats paid more with benefits.....managment was meh as they failed to keep up with feedback...not to mention how some of the managers like to feel self important by lying about or employees..but whatever not much there to motivate good work
bad,The hardest part about the job is always finding a way to promote the redcard without being yelled at by a costumer. patience is definitely a requirement for this job.
bad,"I have worked there for years, and unfortunately the company has changed its ways. We are supposed to be ""all about the guests"" but they also expect everything to be done and is just not realistic."
bad,"Cut throat industry, everyone is competing. Will stomp you out over a grain of rice, constantly looking over your shoulder even if you didn't do anything wrong type of culture."
bad,"When I first started at target, I was amazed by the leadership at the time and the hours as well. I was hired full time and always had leaders working with me to bring me out of my comfort zone. Now sadly I regret to say targets leadership has gone downhill. The new leaders and STL do not assist with anything, I feel like all us DBOs are over worked and have no backup, hours have gone down drastically."
bad,"Not enough support from management no room to grow and low pay."
bad,"There were times when there was lots of work with mandatory and voluntary overtime. Then there were periods of no work. Management was usually out of touch and lacked proper team building skills. Worked most holidays except for Christmas. The employee morale was extremely low. Management seemed very uncaring towards the employees concerns, work/life balance. No acknowledgement or rewards given for great work. Raises stopped. 1 Short break about 15 minutes. Short lunch break, about 25 minutes. Not much room for advancement. Advancement was based on favoritism and not based on skill/job knowledge."
bad,At first the store was great and running well the store got into some trouble new management came in and things were pushed aside and people were starting to be treated differently
bad,does not have the best communication skills with their employees some employees and guest are friendly some are not. the stores are not very organized.
bad,"Even though you may apply for a full-time position doing one job, if it's during the time of year they have seasonal hires you'll probably just be brought on as a seasonal employee and won't get the position you applied for. After the season they'll probably get rid of you and tell you they don't have funding to keep you even though they're the 8th top retailer in the US, yet they'll continue hiring people even after they've let you go. $13/hr would be great if you were full-time, the same goes for the $15/hr they plan on giving in 2020, I feel they get away with this since you'll maybe get around 20hrs of work a week, so that ends up averaging less than minimum wage if you're looking for full-time work. If you want a job with medical this is probably the worst company for that as it apparently takes working full time here for a year to get any of that although after 6 months you apparently acquire some other type of perks. Your first 2 weeks here you're supposed to receiving training from other employees, but be grateful if you even get an hour of training on a register with someone your first day there, be prepared to learn almost everything on your own."
bad,When I applied to work at target it was through multiple stores (6) and all of them didn’t really care about the interview with all but one store using the same 3 questions then telling you “they’ll think about it and call you in 2 days” leaving the whole interview less than 3 minutes depending if you tried to do conversation which they didn’t want. The job itself was ok but they lied to me and misled me by not letting me know that I was front of store attendant while also being the janitor in a sense. Management was rude and always looked down on you and told you what they wanted done first over stuff that needed priority simply because “corporate is coming so make this place presentable while I kick back”. They also loved shifting the blame on other people when their boss got into them so I was always dragged aside for an earful everytime they wanted to nag on me for them getting in trouble even if it wasn’t my responsibility. If you are a cashier they will constantly push you to sell red cards but in the end when they kept telling you that you’ll get a bonus for selling them you won’t get a single dime because all red card sale bonuses go to the store manager and head of HR. Keep looking for a job if you rather want to work at a respectable and responsible place
bad,"In the 4 years I have worked in target that is good is that I have learned 5 different departments & have mastered them all. I have learned about team work & how to communicate with my co workers & guests  accordingly."
bad,"I did not enjoy working here and would not recommend it, but it did pay fairly and is great if you are looking for something temporary between jobs. But i guess that's to be expected with a large corporation with fast turn over of its employees."
bad,You are paid just over minimum wage and the world is expected of you. Don't expect someone to run for this wage just that the job will get done eventually.
bad,"Management is highly critical, the hours are terrible and you will work all holidays. It's typical retail in this regard. They expect an extraordinarily high amount of work for very little pay and zero appreciation. Hours are cut at random and you are never guarantied a minimum number of hours. The negativity is palpable among most employees and turn over rate is very high. Human resources is a joke and nothing is confidential. I truly would never recommend Target as a place to seek employment."
bad,After seasonal staff left they didn't give back staff their hours but instead kept reducing them. Went from 32 hours a week to 4 hours a week. Was not an enjoyable experience in the least.
bad,The managers at the Target in the Pheasant Lane Mall are rude and very inconsiderate. They are NOT military friendly at all. They have favorites and don’t treat every team member the same.
bad,The leaders on the floor were very hard to reach at some point during the day. The store is very unorganized and there were different types of clothing in places it shouldn't be which confused a lot of the customers.
bad,"They make you work exceedingly hard, with no time or support. They also don't pay very well, and you only get benefits if you work full time, but they try and give you the bare minimum of  hours so you end up not eligible for those benefits."
bad,They are not really flexible if you have to change your availability even tho they have hundreds of people working for the company. They pay more and cut hours
bad,"The company pays minimum for a lot of task to be completed during your shift."
bad,"It was your average job. Rude boss, horrible hours, terrible pay, weird/creepy co-workers, & really boring work. They didn’t have enough employees, so if you requested a day off it would more than likely be denied. So say goodbye to your social life. If you’re desperate, this is your place! Otherwise, I’d look elsewhere."
bad,"My job title says 'checkout advocate' but i am given jobs such as OPU (Fufillment), GSA(Guest Service Assistant), Guest Service, Self Checkout, the list goes on and on, needless to say the amount of workload the target I currently work at has gotten incredibly over bearing for me and has started to wear me and alot of other people down."
bad,A great place to work during the holiday season. There’s nothing more rewarding than seeing customers and their children light up with excitement  when they experience the holiday displays and view the specialty items in the store. Being a team member around this time of year of year is ideal.
bad,"It’s a community based job , if you are looking to continue to grow in your career or trying to better yourself as a person this is not the job for you"
bad,Only given hours when you were needed. No place for a person with responsibilities.  Hours were not stable. A lot of favoritism.  Victimization if there way was not met by being given less hours. That manager recently got fired so hopefully it would be better now.
bad,"Maybe I just didn't have the best management team, but it was awful. They'd make impossible demands and they really didn't care about me at all. I needed to leave because I collapsed at work and it was like pulling teeth to get coverage for me. I had to walk to the hospital down the road and it turned out I was coming down with an aggressive strep - which they refused to acknowledge my doctor's note for. I was also having problems with my medications from fainting spells to random massive bruises all over my body. I think they were trying to get me to quit because of my health issues, but it wasn't like I wasn't showing up to work or anything. Because of how I was treated, I just left. Got a second job, put my two weeks in, and left."
bad,Management/corporate is completely unreasonable. Told us we can’t have water or drinks behind the counter to drink. Same for cashiers and stockers on the floor. So I’m supposed to walk back to my locker whenever I’m thirsty? Waste of time. No one higher up wants to help and only seem interested when someone higher than them is checking up on the store.
bad,"I started out getting decent hours at target, generally under thirty until there was a company wide reorganization. After that, I averaged fourteen hours a week.While I was there, I had to manage backroom pulls, guest assistance, reshop and various other tasks for Electronics and toys at minimum."
bad,"Managers were told to work a minimum of 10 hour days which extend to 12-16 hr days during the holiday season. Upper management decided to switch how they do everything and what ever employee that had difficulty adjusting they fired. These are people that had been with the company for 10+ years and they didn't care. People kept getting hurt and because of how messy the store has gotten specially the back room due to lack of bodies and overworking the team. I love what target stands for, but walmart is treating their employees better as well as their shoppers..."
bad,"The pay is good ($13 per hour) however target only schedules an employee between 5-25 hours per week. Hardly making a living wage without a second job; which they frown upon and is hard to work because they demand you work beyond your scheduled quit time or they proclaim you ""unreliable"". Training is non-existant and job-related knowledge is acquired by yourself or from other employees (who most of the time don't know either). Workplace culture is subvertively fun but breakroom  goodies are provided after 11am when the morning crew has left for the day."
bad,"On an individual level, the people I worked with were great and cared about your well being. On a corporate level, you are easily replaceable and the bottom line is profit. Terrible benefits, no incentive to work harder than necessary, advancement is a joke and they will hire from outside."
bad,"Starting off at 13 an hour in retail is really good. I had great expectations starting my job at Target. But what I didn't find out until after I started is only management is full time. So if your only working 15 to 20 hours a week, like I was it's not enough."
bad,"Stocking and Rotation of products, pulling stock from backroom to fill shelves. Talking with guests and offering assistance whenever i can making sure they have a good experience. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management they would give tasks that seemed impossible to work or finish, and if you did finish such tasks no recognition would be rewarded."
bad,I did like working at target till i only got 20 hrs a week. Im a really hard worker always on time and fell they wont move me up. I do my job great just tired of staying at doing carts. Have shown i can do more.
bad,Was promised full time when I was hired but ended up with 15 hours a week. I took a pay cut from my previous job because I thought I would get more hours. Ended up going back to previous job.
bad,"Insane productivity quotas visibly strung employees out."
bad,"You will have to be able to be pulled in all different directions, getting orders from different manager who might say the same or different thing. Honestly, working at Target is for a person who is okay with a high-stress level work environment. It was not for me, it might be for you. It does pays well, but it does not seem worth the amount."
bad,I wouldn’t try to make a career out of this job. It’s a dead in. They don’t treat they employees like people. They have no sympathy for your health. Target it alright just depends on what kind of boss you have.
bad,Terrible place to work would not reccomend anyone looking for a solid job with people that care about you work at this absolutely horrendous establishment.
bad,"This place treats you a little better than many retail places when you first start, but they reel you in, then take advantage of you. I witnessed several co-workers trained on positions that are supposed to pay more, but they were never given their pay raise, even after bringing up the issue with management. I worked at 3 different Targets over a 4 year span and it was the same basic environment throughout. Toxic, and the executive level (which are glorified assistant managers) do not care about the hourly workers at all. This I encountered at every single location. There is zero consistency within this corporation, and I firmly believe that all they care about are numbers. As long as profits are up, they will do anything to maintain it. That is simply my opinion. Managers, not just hourly workers, rarely last here. The last Target I worked at had gone through 8 store managers in roughly 8-9 years. They also pay horribly. I was promoted from team member to team leader, and was given a measly pay raise for the amount of responsibility I was given. I received so much poor treatment from several of the managers, one in particular barked orders at me and condescended to me, eventually creating the reason I chose to quit. I was also given the run around by a human resources manager; in other words, I was told I could step down as supervisor but then 3-4 weeks later was told otherwise suddenly after being led to believe something different for weeks. It was like no one could give me a straight answer either when I confronted management about the issue. I was spoken to like I was a"
bad,"I did not enjoy working at target. However, I don’t want to speak for all stores because everyone’s experience is different. Hours and scheduling were never consistent. Many people struggle with receiving barely any hours."
bad,I enjoyed it at first but the management is awful and hours are never guaranteed. There were weeks I worked 40+ then some less then 10. Very inconsistent especially for hard workers who always show up too work.
bad,Terrible company HR doesn't care about team members they only care about managers and payroll if you go to HR about a problem you will get fired!!!!!!
bad,"The management frequently abuse their position to manipulate schedules with little to no warning to the individual. They'll cancel your vacation less than a week out, they'll schedule you outside your hours, they'll rarely work with a second job to balance your schedule and always want to have the majority of your time."
bad,"I work in the heat pushing carts in most days there and I am expected to bring in more than I can handle. It is too hot most days for work and I generally feel that management asks me more than I am able to accomplish, which is for the most part bringing in carts in the 100 degree heat of Arizona. They seem concerned only about how much work I have done and not that I am easily tired out due to the heat."
bad,The job is not hard but the managers were extremely untrained on how to manage a team. There was a lack of direction and communication between departments and employees
bad,"If your a good worker they will take advantage and make you starting everyone else's job as well. Its good if your in school but if your trying to make career out of it, look for something else."
bad,"There is no communication between management. They don't care what you're available to work, they schedule you when they want. There is no accountability for anyone, everyone does what they want. Since they raised the pay, the people that have worked there for years make the same amount as the ones that just started or that will start."
bad,"I worked here for about a year and a half and hated every moment of it. I was a cashier, yet I was expected to perform the jobs and tasks of my supervisors while they lounged in the cafe. I put in my two week notice and when they scheduled me an extra week after that, I tried to settle it so I wouldn't have to technically ""no call, no show"" even though I was in another city entirely and had given them apt notice, Long story short, I can't work for Target for another 4 years."
bad,Management is the main problem with Target. They have team members doing 3 different tasks at once most of the time. They don’t care if you're experienced or not they will throw you in there.
bad,There is continuously less organization and communication. Corners have been cut to the expense of being able to accomodate even the basic daily tasks. Supervisors feed into the confusion.
bad,"Tulsa Hills Target is the most stressful place to work. The employees are way overworked and very unappreciated. The turnover rate is embarrassingly high at this store. The morale is so low amongst the employees it makes for a very depressing work environment. Management is uncaring and needs a total overhaul. "
bad,"Overall not a bad place to work, the only issues i had were with poor management. I would recommend giving this place a try if you need a part time job."
bad,This isnt necessarily a bad job. Customers are customers and can be pains. However the actual company is an issue. Got hired with 50+ other people and they decided to only keep three total. Was told to reapply later and I would have priority. Applied and never even got another interview. Just a bunch of bull.
bad,"As a seasonal employee the scheduling was my biggest complaint. I explained I was in college and did not want a shift on the same days as my classes yet I was still scheduled. When I would tell management/scheduling they would tell me to just not show up instead of swapping me to another day. Didn't schedule me for 2 weeks straight randomly and then over scheduled me during thanksgiving when I had assignments to turn in."
bad,"Good job for students, seasonal workers, due to the flexible schedule."
bad,Management is awful. It's all about who you are friends with. They're rude if you are friends. No room for advancement. Hours are back and forth so you basically don't have a life.
bad,Was severely injured by being locked in a walk in cooler for almost 2 hours. The stockroom is littered with safety issues even after OSHA had a visit  . .
bad,I worked at Target as a student in high school and the management was a complete mess they messed up scheduling several times paid some people late and the managers were 20 somethings trying to act like they were the kings of the area. I recently applied at a different Target to see if it was going to be different but no it was they lost my drug test 3 times and failed to contact me to let me know what was happening at all and continually sent me of a goose chase to find who in the world could tell me what was going on.
bad,"Management is very poor. HR team is not good. I begged and begged for more hours and constantly opened my availability. I went from 30 hours to 5-10 every week. I never got vacation hours because the maximum hours they would work me would be 15. I constantly was ridiculed, and management displayed blatant favoritism. Not a good place to work unless you kiss up to management."
bad,"The leadership is inconsistent and incompetent. No one knows what to do, but if you're doing something wrong, they'll definitely let you know. Although the leadership swears they're there for you and care about your wellbeing, this is difficult to believe when an unmanageable workload is thrust upon you. I wish I had better words to describe my feelings, but I am so irritated with my current position that I find it difficult to think."
bad,"Coworkers in your level are great, but the management is awful, they hire people who aren't qualified and are immature, when working at Target the try to give little to no hours, unless you are a team lead or doing something special like working overnights, they are very persistent on nobody reaching overtime."
bad,"Management will hire you on seasonally with the promise of being kept on if productivity and attendance is high, then you will bust your butt, becoming cross trained in EVERY department, at the end of the season, the store manager won't even have the balls to tell you that he isn't keeping you and just removes you from the system, so when you show up to cover a shift you picked up... someone will"
bad,"Well, at this current time, the store i work at is missing a store leader, HR support, and we are almost always borrowing maintenance from other locations. "
bad,The experience was fine the hours were flexible just no advancement. I wouldn't think of back to work for this company anytime in the furture. Wasn't the right fit for my skills and abilities
bad,I was frequently held after the end of my shift which I found to be very stressful because oftentimes I would have plans after work and would have to cancel because I was stuck working. In general I really liked the work that I did and the people that I work with were nice too.
bad,Target flaunts their $15/hr starting pay but what they don't tell you is that you will only get scheduled 4 to 5 hour shifts. I work 6 day work weeks and only get a max of 28 hours.
bad,"Management does not communicate well, follow up, or assist new employees. They rush you through training unless you cannot grasp one area. Then they assign you to that area or rotate you to the areas you have been trained in.  They do not allow time to refresh each area which has differences in most of the areas. They ask you to focus on safety yet there are unsafe work practices that go on consistently each and every day.  They tell you there are time constraints for picking and placing but don’t worry about it during your probationary period and then change it to suit their complaints. Extremely high turnover due to management."
bad,"I was hired for a position posted and had it locked in, but I never got to work on that position. They gave me false hope by letting me do other jobs within the store and said this was temporary. This would have been fine, if the other department had a good supervisor, unfortunately was not and under was favoring others."
bad,"I worked at Target a few years ago, it was your standard retail job experience. I worked Part time and was never allowed to have overtime, even. Management was constantly contradicting themselves with their policies at my store."
bad,"The work was not bad, however the expectations are unrealistic and they will fire 4/5 people, rather than employ them after their 90 day probationary period. They will literally find any small excuse to fire you at the end of your contract. Do not expect them to provide a stable job or hours."
bad,"Used to be a fun workplace, after the wage hike Target has become a stressful/ toxic work environment. Team members are ill informed and  micromanaged from the corporate level. Target has removed almost all chances of team member contribution to the advancement of the company. The standards change daily making almost impossible to maintain competency at any level. Expect to work part time with full time availability, to include evenings and weekends. Not recommended for a single parent or someone needing a second job."
bad,"A lot of things were a mess, management was hectic, people quit all the time. People who quite included managers and people from every section of the store."
bad,"I enjoyed working at target. However mangment changed so much that the enviorment was at times uncomfortable. Just when your forming a work relationship with a coworker he or she was fired"
bad,Management has a huge turnover rate and the overall workplace is disorganized and sometimes unproductive.  Middle management is overwhelmed and stressed trying to meet the needs of the store and district managers.
bad,Although management was not the smoothest the retail environment gave me the speaking skills to present myself in a different environment. I also learned how to manage my team hands on.
bad,"Not any more, people don't know what they're doing.   Target has gotten rid of all of their seasoned people.  There's very few people there to trains the new people.  New management hasn't a clue what's going on and very rude.  The stores are junky and un-organized."
bad,"While the pay is really good for an entry level job, the job environment and constant changes to policy were a nightmare. Management and corporate are absolutely clueless. All together a relatively easy entry level job ruined by too much corporate involvement."
bad,"A Typical day for me was trying to balance my time between my tasks and team member training. That rarely worked out because team members were always being pulled in many different directions. management was not very supportive, and this quickly became a culture of favoritism.  The hardest part was trying to get your task done because the store was always incredibly hot. No matter how much you pointed this out. it always stayed hot , except of course when executives came to visit."
bad,"Honestly it was not worth it in the end....so you really do not have an exact training schedule, the team leads are lazy and expect the team members to do everything while the step off to the side and talk, and the management for the departments nit-pick everything...now with the ok...the discounts were nice and they would always have food for you in the break room to enjoy..."
bad,"The moral of target is absolutely horrible.  The Store manager is allowed to treat people any way, and they will not be held accountable. They expect you to work mid shifts daily and treat you like horrible. The leaders who actually care about the team are treated like trash. Do not bother reaching out to District or Cooperate , they will side with the Store Manager"
bad,"It's a stressful job with inconsistent hours and no benefits unless you are in management. It's fine for a part-timer, but terrible if you need full time work."
bad,"When I first started I was thrown to the wolves, basically. The training was minimal, and I was just told ""just do this"", like just put out this vehicle of stock.  Ive been there 7 months and I still have not been trained adequately enough to do everything they have added to my daily routine. There is a high turn over rate. It seems as if target only cares for corporate numbers,  never the people that work for them. Team leads and management are lacking in knowledge and access to things."
bad,My supervisor was the best thing about my job. There was a high rate of turnover in the area I worked so I was always stuck covering all the shifts. I was working 6 days a week and closing at least 5 of those days. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the popcorn machine.
bad,They don’t care if you have a life outside of Target. They told my friend to quit her second job instead of fixing her hours. They scheduled me on days I had classes even though they approved my availability change. The amount of work they expect you to do within a 4 hour shift (which is about as long as a shift as you’ll get) is unrealistic and back breaking. They preach the whole “team is family” motto but have never once backed it up. The only good thing here  is the pay and the coworkers (some of them).
bad,Barely any hours and they continue to hire people. Management is terrible. No way to move up in the company. Once company raises come around you dont keep your annual pay. Too much drama in the work place.
bad,"Full time jobs were only offered to management, and the management at the time I worked there had an ability to let people get extremely low prices on items that were obviously moved to a different spot.  It was like there was nothing that they wouldn't allow.  People were actually bringing back clothes bought at Walmart and getting refunds at Target."
bad,It's a decent place to work if you are going to school and it is a short term plan.  Other then that you plateaue and dont really move up in pay or progress
bad,"Stressful, target cares more about cases then quality apprehensions that actually make a difference. Never enough hours for team members and constantly having hours cut and changed last minute"
bad,Ive been there for 2 years and have to beg people to get anywhere new to advance my knowledge! I have expressed my concerns very frequently and nothing changes.
bad,"Target is ok for a first job or for retirement to keep busy on a few days but not to live off of to support or earn a living to keep a roof over one's head, food on the table, etc...Management was lacking at this job the team leaders would tell everyone the do's and don't and then you would turn around and see them doing what they just told you not to do while working?!? Fairness in work was lacking with management."
bad,"Honestly, I think it was just my store, but the management team literally threw us under the bus because they wouldn’t schedule enough people to even keep my Starbucks open for breaks."
bad,"They promise you more hours and you never see them unless its around Christmas time. Only provided 4-5 hours a day with 3 days a week to work. Logistics team members are completely responsible for their areas and they don't pay enough for what all they expect you to do. Had multiple problems with management due to favoritism and the way they talk to people. Alot of employees get away with doing nothing while you do your work, plus theirs. They expect you to put your job first before your family and the emergencies. The manager of the store is really nice and easy to talk to.he would always come by and check on everything and get your opinion but nothing ever changed. Don't recommend this job unless you need one desperately."
bad,"Some departments are well run by fun, professional, fair management and employees are well trained in equipment and duties. "
bad,You will be doing a lot of lifting hard labor. Mgmt talk to me like I'm a kid instead of an adult which is ridiculous! When I started told I would get full time hours but the the hours will fluctuate from week to week. Also very warm in the bldg. Air conditioning either isn't good or they don't like to use it so you'll be sweating. Needless to say I'm looking for another job!
bad,"The Management at the Target in Silver Spring is dismal. The managers seem to lose their sense of humanity the higher up the chain they go. A Typical day at work consists of any given Team Member taking on the workload of 2 to 3 other Team Members due to there purposely only having one person scheduled during any given 5-hour block in that department. The management is aware of this disgusting misplacement of resources, but still holds the Team accountable for the missed goals or the underperformance of tasks they could not feasibly be expected to complete."
bad,All managers work to use you as just another object and another body to add to work in the front lanes. You're never treated like an actual person and instead as another person working as a slave to that awful company.
bad,Work can be enjoyable but lack of strong leadership and miscommunication can make any team fall apart. Raises are kept to the bare minimum and favoritism plays a role.
bad,"Poor Schedule management, I was scheduled multiple times outside of my set availability, this lead to being fired because of shifts missed that were outside of hours I could work."
bad,"Every store is different, most of them are equally terrible. Mine happened to be one of the few that wasn’t AS bad as the others, but still awful. I worked there for 4 years, started as cashier/guest service and switched to style consultant 2 years ago. Target as a company swears they care about your mental health, and offers different types of leave of absences. Yet when I asked for an LOA I was immediately told no by my leader, actually illegal! Management does not care about the team members, works you like crazy, plays favorites, so much drama it’s like high school, it’s all terrible. The pay is what makes you think “ok maybe i’ll deal with it” but ultimately it’s not worth it. dont waste your time and ruin your mental health, this company is terrible."
bad,"I’ll keep it short: modernization is the worst thing Target has done to its Team Members. It’s absolutely stressful and screws up everything, along with cutting almost everyone’s hours, which means the recent pay bump doesn’t matter. I find it horrible that they bump your pay with a couple cents now but next June it’ll be back to the minimum pay of $13, so it’s like your efforts didn’t matter. "
bad,"The ETL  was overbearing and wouldn't let me do my job."
bad,"Hardest part is the getting hours, and constant standing, micro management. The best part is the family part of it, made many friends working at Target. Target was a fun place to work when I first started and I was proud to work there but now with the changes not so much"
bad,"As Target has raised their base pay they are expecting a lot more from the employees. Sometimes these expectations are impossible to achieve.They have also taken responsibility away from the the leads and put it on the lower level employees. There are so many leads telling you what to do and then another comes along wanting to know who told you to do that. You never know what to do what not to do or how to do it because it is always incorrect. Extremely frustrating. Another frustration is the work equipment I.e... walkie talkies,devices,computer equipment. The computers crash all the time. There is never enough walkie talkies or devices to go around. How are you suppose to perform your job without the equipment needed???!!!! They have also cut staffing I assume this is because of the pay going up. So you have to do the job of 5 people at times, work very quickly, and deal with people that are upset because they have had to wait to be served. Guest service has gone way down."
bad,"Lack of communication and poor choice in which employee to promote, solely based on seniority. Management did not say a word when removing myself and a few friends from my department from the schedule all together. Most other co-workers were kind and considerate, which is nice to have in a quick-pace and competitive work environment."
bad,It was alright could’ve been more relaxed but fair work space and hours. Manager worked with my schedule and school hours. Never worried about being late.
bad,while the pay was awesome i noticed i had very little hours eventhough we were incredibly shot staffed. management was often never on the same page and the store was a mess.
bad,"the most enjoyable part of my job was, of course, the team I worked with. My supervisor was amazing.  Loved being able to help people all day with decisions about there clothing. workplace culture was getting so bad everyone not happy about all the changes being made. people wanting to leave. the workload was fine until hours were cut in half. when you store lead has no idea what your workday looks like it's very frustrating, to say the least. Yet still, I knew what needed to be done and worked hard to accomplish that."
bad,"Unprofessional employees and poor management "
bad,"I was hired as flex for holiday season, which turned out to be picking/packing fulfillment orders in the warehouse. The pace was so hurried and frantic with little space to move and multiple persons to a work space. I am in my late 50's and let me tell you, I worked my tail off and even fell backwards onto warehouse floor after loosing my balance on a pallet. I filled out an accident report and then nothing! I asked to be moved out of this position, as it was exacerbating my injury but they would not. They continuously scheduled me more hours and outside of my given availability.  They also called me many times asking if I would come in to work xtra shifts and I did.  I asked about filing workers comp to recoup my medical bills but was never given any assistance or guidance as to whom to go and see and how to go about this. They kept blowing me off about this. When seasonal was over I asked if I could stay on and work inside the store in hard lines and they said no, because I didn't like the flex position therefore no other position would be extended. I worked circles around most there and even came in when I was injured and remained in a position that I hated and was injured doing. What did it get me? Nothing! This management is horrible and unethical. They use you up and throw you away. They will say anything to get u to work seasonal and work you like a dog and then hire a 16 year old kid instead of you. I was treated terrible as a seasonal employee and I went above and beyond for management."
bad,"I have worked for target for 8 years, and in the 8 years I have never worked for a company that doesn't look out for their employees. I would rather re join the army and get shot at again then work for target."
bad,They tend to add  stressors that aren't capable of being done safely. They also say you will receive full time hours that you will not receive. Aside from the safety training do not expect  to know what you need to do your job.
bad,"I am a current employee but have been looking for another job and hoping to leave soon. The job is stressful and demanding. They talk about safety every morning but expect you to push your body beyond regular limits to make prod numbers. Things they forget to mention during the hiring process is that you are on call EVERY WEEK for an overtime day, yes, EVERY WEEK! You have to call the hotline on Wednesday after 6 p.m. to find out if you have to work on Sunday through the rest of the week. You are assigned an overtime day and have no choice but to work it or you get a strike against you. You get ""strikes"" against you for calling off if you have no sick time, continually not making prod, coming in late, late getting back from breaks, or bad attitude. After a few strikes, you get a disciplinary action against you. There is a big turnover. They don't care that you can't have a life outside of work. It's all about the ""company's"" needs. The pay is good, but not worth being on call every week of the year or the stress of wondering if you will get disciplinary actions or fired on a constant basis."
bad,"Target keeps changing things and makes everything even worse, there is no opportunity  to move up unless you leave, get a business degree, and then come back."
bad,"To say this company is out of touch is an understatement, at least at the San Clemente store.  Management are all scatterbrained and don't communicate with each other, which results in directive changes for the team members during the day.  Severely understaffed, which results in huge workloads being dumped on one person.  The guests are typically friendly with some exceptions.  Workingin holidays is just gross as well.  Overall I'd say an it's a fairly unpleasant working environment."
bad,"Lack of communication between management, too much work expected in short period of times, inconsistency of advancement options, hours have been drastically cut"
bad,Management not always on same track.  Training not properly implemented for best results. Co-workers cause you to work against yourself. Starting pay is descent. But no one can live off of 5 to 20 hours a week. So you come to target believing a job where you can get ahead. Truth is financially you can't survive.
bad,Target is management heavy. Almost more managers than team members. You will have 5 bosses all telling you to do different things. Small budget to pay employees because management gets all the hours. Was promised 40 hours a week and was lucky to get scheduled for 20. If you get scheduled for 8 hours. Prepare to go home early. Everytime they will call you on walkie and make you go home due to running out of payroll money Highly stressful work environment. Lots of favoritism.  Do not recommend.
bad,"Not really able to move up, or be placed where you want. Hire out rather than promoting people that already work there. Very high turnover rate including management."
bad,"The management is not the greatest right now and it really reflects on the store as a whole. Many good friends who have been really great at their jobs have been fired or left, which makes everything worse because the new people can't grasp concepts very well. Corporate also has new things happening that limit what we do every day so not everything they want us to do can get done in a timely manner."
bad,"The culture at Target is slightly better, however the expectations are set so high and provide minimal compensation - barely above minimum wage.  I would have to work extensive hours just to cover basic incidental expenses,."
bad,"I was a GSA at Target for almost four years. I started off as a cashier and I loved working there. I was promoted to GSA about 8 months after I started. Basically, as a GSA, you are given all the responsibility of a GSTL but paid a little more than a cashier. Management will only consider you for a promotion if you play a politics game, no matter how hard you work or how good your relationship with your team is. Doesn't matter if your TL endorses you for a promotion, its up to your ETL."
bad,"-Highly unprofessional"
bad,Working at Target is a hassle and very fast paced. Schedules are poorly assembled and expectations are overly high for a retail company that continues to cut workers hours.
bad,usually when i enter work on a typically day it goes pretty easy and well going but the mager is really tough and expects you to finish everything in about 15 min.
bad,"A average day would consist of running around the store doing your job, while getting harassed by your head of department. Your manager is constantly stopping you from doing your job to see what your doing. Obviously your working. They give unreasonable goal times to one person for a three person job. Your managers also sit in the break room all day talking about how terrible there team members are. The schedule is always wrong and needing to be fixed. There is also a HUGE amount of favoritism. When you ask for your managers help they always roll their eyes and try to find every way possible not to help you."
bad,I was the newest employee in the backroom so I had to work every shift alone as the store closed. Because I was alone I never had anyone to ask questions to when I didn't know something.
bad,"In Target, the TL's (Team Leaders) and a few ETL's (Elite Team Leaders) are unprofessional and treat the other team members with complete disrespect and the amount of bias is disgusting. They claim a ""team-building"" mentality but really only mean they MIGHT treat you with some respect but only after doing everything they tell you with no question, even if their ideas are completely idiotic. I went to Target to acquire some knowledge about how a big corporation operates, but it's nothing more than a bunch of tyrants belittling their workers for things they cannot control."
bad,"Target use to be a very nice company, from the way the store ran to managers who where nice, understanding and loved their jobs. Now Targets corporate is always changing how they want things done by making new rules, which make it harder and harder to get the job done. The stores managers and employees turn over rates are terrible. Team members are under appreciated. Target talks a big game like its easy to move up in the company, but anytime there is a managers position open they hire someone outside the company instead of promoting with in."
bad,"Current store tries to run bigger than it actually has the infrastructure to handle. ALWAYS under-staffed despite always hiring. Complete favoritism played despite no clear or good reasoning. Management typically has zero experience in retail or in general, so every wage worker can feel that. Lots of stress, high expectations, lots of problems that are hard to resolve. Toxic environment from the top to the bottom, between management and coworkers."
bad,"Target needs to take care of their employees. They treat their employees like their own personal robot toys, fulfilling their own goals set. It almost abusive sometimes. I hear all the time people getting yelled at for not working faster.  They make promises to get you in, then don't follow through.  The employees are hard working. The turnaround is almost funny."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the occasional treats for holidays.  The management doesn't seem to care about the individual well being of employees.  I have learned other areas of work in the store.
bad,"I made a lot of friends but friends don't pay the bills at target, but i had a lot of fun, But they have a lot of things they should work out like the fact that you have to fight with them to get more hours and they don't give straight answers"
bad,"I think it's important to note that my ratings are from what I experienced before I resigned. When I first started, Target wasn't so bad: I was seasonal, so the only issues were that my department was super understaffed and the work expectations were extremely unrealistic. I worked in softlines/apparel and accessories. Holidays are the roughest and yet team leads would expect employees to get so much done to a point where it was physically exhausting. It never registered in their heads that they needed to hire more, so they blamed workers instead. However, that was my /only/ issue and I was kept permanent. Also, there are also lots of micromanaging over walkie-talkies, but that was it."
bad,"Target was a good place to work.  The management was all about themselves though and did not really give a hoot about the employees.  It was all about what can you do for the company and we are not going to give you anything in return.  Raises were a maybe, time off, well good luck."
bad,Hours are terrible and management doesn't really want to help you succeed as they cut hours to save money. Its a scramble to get more then 16 hours and even worse to get a full shift alone
bad,"Target in general is horribly unorganized and mismanaged, with Target Starbucks being even worse. Poor shift coverage, not allowed to accept tips, management does the bare minimum. Multiple ingredients and paper products out of stock constantly. Target policy is to cut costs by having a few overworked and underpaid people doing a job that requires more people. Will schedule you so you just barely miss the cutoff for benefits."
bad,"Worked as a part of the grocery section team.  Team was perpetually understaffed (awful hours didn't help in that regard), and management was utterly uninterested in trying to improve the situation."
bad,The manager was very lazy and had favorites. They would feed us unhealthy food most of the time. Co- workers were lazy as well and would often call out alot of the time. The so-called guests would treat us like animals and the manager would still take their side because they don't want a bad rep and the customer's money.
bad,It was a great place to work at times . But other times really fast paced and sometimes it was overwhelming and to much work. But the pay was great and the vacation and sick hours were very good plus you get all paid holidays and the bosses are really cool
bad,Worked graveyard shift. was very fast paced. pay was not enough to survive off of. would be a good job for someone just out of high school but could never see it a   career.
bad,They didn't work with my school schedule well and the management was not effective.  I was able to train in on many different areas and increase my skills but overall it wasn't a pleasant experience.
bad,"The opportunity to work at the Janesville Target could be strengthened with a more hands-on, empathetic leadership style from the store manager and by more opportunities for career advancement for current employees (it is not common for leadership roles to be filled from within the company)."
bad,I applied to Target because I thought I would be an immediate cashier but when I got there we were basically doing warehouse jobs like moving heavy boxes and doing labor work. They basically hired me without telling me we were putting the store together.
bad,co-workers and people you work with are the only really redeeming thing. the management is bad only cause no one really knows what they're doing and they are bad with communicating thing between each other. So you are mostly left in the dark about some important parts of your job that other managers will ask you about. which can lead to simple thing become a lot more stressful then they need to be.
bad,"Target is a great place to work at, it was one big family that helped you along the way. Everyday was a learning experience within the company, by its growth."
bad,a typical day at target was to organize the backroom as best as possible. The managers always pulled me off important tasks and had me be counter productive.
bad,"Working at target was pretty good at the beginning but as time went on I realized it is not the place for me. Target is not a very professional nor caring company. Everyone at my location is nonchalant and non caring, the store is not ran how it should be."
bad,"I was only a seasonal employee, so the hours were really bad, they cut into my hours from my other job.  didn't really enjoy it,  the pay was not enough"
bad,Not much to add to the review when the summary says it all they over stress their employees and the head managers can careless about the well being of the departments and their workers
bad,"A typical day as a cashier involved checking out customers, attempting to get them to sign up for a red card, and stocking the front end. I learned how to deal with unruly customers and stay on my toes. The management was quite poor except for 1 woman. There was not much workplace culture and the hardest part of the job was the management itself. The most enjoyable part were some of my peers."
bad,"Working as a cashier was very stressful. Management does not care about how nice you are to customers, how fast you are, etc. they only care about how many redcards you can get people to sign up for. They would rather have you be inconsiderate to customers by constantly berating them to sign up for the red card rather than being genuinely nice to them. Very strict on hours. There are some people I know that are still at this job and love it, however, it depends on the person. If you are interested in becoming a salesman/are competitive this may be the job for you."
bad,management is bad do not expect to move up with the company i gave 4 years to target and got kicked to the curb if you decide to work there expect the same you will not be happy with the situation
bad,"I really enjoyed my fellow team members and the customers that shopped there."
bad,"There is no job security unless you're close friends with someone in mid or upper management. You are assessed by an complete joke of numbers that you MUST meet, whether there are enough team members to get the job done or not. Otherwise you'll be on the chopping block, no matter how much you improve over time. Scapegoating is a thing. Management is an absolute, lazy mess. High turnover rate."
bad,Target pays very well and the work can be a little stressful at times but the downfall of Target is the management and the people you have to work with.
bad,"I liked this job for a while, until coworkers started to show their true colors. As a cashier, my job was pretty easy. Until the guests start to complain. Whatever they don't like is your fault as the cashier - whether it's pieces, people, machines, you, your supervisor, etc. The complaints are never verified either, it's always 'they're right, you're wrong'. Or it's more closely ""we don't care to hear what you have to say"". If you don't kiss the very ground the guests walk on, you'll be threatened to be fired. Multiple times."
bad,They hire to many excutives with no work ecperience.They are right out of college.The excutives want to blame the leaders for not getting their work done. But they never leave them alone to finish their work load
bad,The atmosphere at this workplace is terrible. Management does not communicate well and every managers' priorities for each work center are different. It is overall very dysfunctional and frustrating to work here.
bad,Getting to work and clocking in then going out to my assigned register to begin to ring up my customers was a useful experience. Doing my job and helping customers/guests was a highlight of my day. Our manager was a good guy who was pretty attentive but not a micro manager. The culture of Target is one of a slightly different feeling from a Walmart or Bj's in that we had a more customer appreciative feeling going on. The hardest part of the job was one time I had to clean a biohazard in a bathroom even though that wasn't in my job description- but it had to be done and I did it. The most rewarding part of my job was when I went out of my way to help guests (the Target term for customers) by going above and beyond the normal expectations of what I had to do.
bad,I am a hard worker who likes to stay busy so in this work environment I was struggling to remain productive. I was constantly restocking shelves and performing various cleaning activities to bide my time.
bad,"Working at Target was very disappointing to me because they do not promote their employees from within and they do not compensate their employees for the amount of hard work they do."
bad,"Low pay, favoritism, terrible management and an overall lack of sane work environment made target an awful place of work. No help from HR or management. Do not recommend."
bad,"The management team plays favorites way too heavily and if they do not like you they will cut hours and say ""there just isn't too many hours."" Lots of lies go around and some people are forced to work much harder than others. Used to be a fair and positive place to work but it seems like Target does not know what they are doing anymore."
bad,"Very busy, little down time, managements expectations were unreasonable.  You were expected to unload and stock shelves within an allotted period of time regardless of the size of the trucks."
bad,It was a nightmare. They call me in on my day off during a comic con so I'm dressed in a cosplay. I proceed to get ready for work then realize I left my good shoes at home. (The only thing I have to wear are platforms.) On my way back to my car to put my things away before work I trip and roll my ankle. Going back to the breakroom then to look I see my other foot is bleeding from the platforms. Go to tell my manager he says I still have to work...
bad,worked part time seasonal was over worked and underpaid I felt for the efforts I put in. felt that more appropriate means of meeting employees needs could have been done.
bad,Target was the worst job I ever had the people I worked with very nice we will all close very relaxed and cool with each other but management horrible
bad,"The job is stressful not enough hours, The only time you could get enough hours is during holidays and you are required to work 6 or 7 days a week. Any other time hours were 20 hours per week or less."
bad,Responsible for all aspects of floor cleanliness. Worked as a team in doing light  maintenance. Maintained safety  for  customer satisfaction.Compliance with  Department of  Health regulations.
bad,There was to much gossip and drama at that location and not enough positive leadership. Those in charge were showing favoritism to friends and tried to put all the hard work on the older employees
bad,Working for Target was stressful and mentally exhausting. I don' recommend working there especially after their remodel. Too many changes to keep up with and not enough pay for the work that you do.
bad,Great way to start off. You can gain a lot of customer service experience working at target. Great way to get your feet wet and open doors to figuring out what you want to do and what is next
bad,"Training is a joke, and no one seems to be clear on what or how to train new staff members. The company is too focused on ""guest service first"" so far to the point where employees can slack off their duties or disappear entirely, and as long as they say it was for a guest, they get away with it. Management and area/team leads do not take concerns or complaints seriously."
bad,"I worked at Target for almost 4 years and I have no idea how I made it that long. I worked on the sales floor which means I was right in the middle of it all. You are required to help cashiers. You are required to take phone calls. You are required to help guests with their every need. You are required to sort your own strays and go backs at customer service. Each shift, you are assigned a department that you work in your whole shift by yourself. You pick up strays, you do go backs, you make sure every little item is in its place and pushed forward. You restock constantly and its never ending. The store is always busy and you're thrown around constantly. There is no time to carry out any of your tasks because the work load is ridiculous and you have to help a guest on the other side of the store because you don't know where your coworkers are majority of the time. Management gets upset with you when you don't finish. And you feel bad when you hand off your department to the next person because you literally couldn't do anything all day. The worst part is the closing crew. You get 5 hours to do go backs and put the department back together and it's not enough. Especially because Target is it's most busy at night. It's stressful and impossible to finish all that. Especially if you're in a department with so many small items like cosmetics or HBA. Each aisle takes 20 minutes to fix. Guests will come in and shop and you will have to do it all over again. I do not recommend working here. If you do apply, try for cashier. Do not go for sales floor. It is not worth it. The pay is the"
bad,"Target is too focused on their customers being happy that they forget about their employees. The East Palo Alto Target management is more about due as I say, not as I do type attitude. The male leadership is too focused on being friends with all the younger team members and being liked by everyone they have no discipline. Target was always looking to hire new team members however the team members that had been there since the store opened were getting their hours cut."
bad,I wouldnt recommend this place to work at. Overpriced.sometimes you will find a good deal here.  Im just talking about the balcones heights location. I think that the store could be a lot better its been years since i worked here. They do try to do stuff for the employees like lunches incentives but low pay and they were cutting hours bad when i was there
bad,"This job may work for college students or in an emergency, but is no place to stay and build a career. Some positions have potential value as transferable skills (HR, receiving, security), but most do not."
bad,"Worked here for over a year. Benefits we're minimal even though it seemed like we were working ourselves to death. Dealing with rude guests and trying to explain the policy, just to have someone in upper management overturn your decision and go against policy just to make the guest happy. The managers either didn't care at all or cared too much and we're always down your throat and making sure that you did your own work, even if you didn't have the time to get all the tasks done. I know many people who have skipped breaks to try to get it done."
bad,"When Target was in Canada, they over promised and under-delivered. People were really great to work with, but any sort of problems that arose with procedures and stocking was done extremely slowly."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of LOD's constantly changing shifts and handing out different tasks at hand, sometimes individually and others in pairs to get the job done faster. The culture was something I wasn't used to, sometimes it was a hostile environment when co-workers were in a bad mood but for the most part, everyone was like family, drama included. I learned to be more vocal when I needed assistance with certain tasks and how to be stern in situations when tasks needed to be completed. The most enjoyable part had to be constantly seeing familiar faces and familiarizing myself with all staff and departments."
bad,I got let go for not following rules that either weren’t in the hand book at all or weren’t written clearly/specifically enough for workers to understand. It was complete bs. I wouldn’t recommend working there because of how poorly their rule book is written.
bad,"Not paid fairly for about of work put in. constantly pulled to do other jobs other than your own. Its fine as a stepping stone, but not a career in my opinion."
bad,"Employment at target was short and insightful. Targets management is severely lacking but the coworker experience is decent. Targets management does not seem to value their employees, but coworkers seem to value each other."
bad,"Worked at Target as a truck unload / stocking associate and sometimes as a planogram associate.  Stocking shelves was done under a tight schedule, driving the associates like slaves.  The planogram team was much more reasonable."
bad,"Management is terrible, the commission always changing for the worst. You never know if you going to keep your job. DM plays favoritism and doesn't care for the reps."
bad,Very demanding work with little time or resources to complete daily tasks. Upper management does not interact with Store Teams at all. ETL's carry the load.
bad,The day start out long and gets long most of the team member don't like to help out manager are alway in they bag and move like little kids and all that could stress you
bad,"Target was a employer i went to when i first moved to Schenectady NY it was a low wage paying employer with no benefits."
bad,"I learned how to use a cash register, how to make sure things are displayed nice, and work with customers and give their visit a possible plus if they came through my lane."
bad,"While the pay for a Retail Manager with this company is very good, the working environment is poor.  I did not find that the salary compensated fairly for the expectations and time away from my family.  While I was very good at this profession, I choose to leave retail entirely."
bad,"When I began 8 years ago it was the best and most diverse company I had ever worked for.  I enjoyed the people, I felt as though I was an important part of the leadership team.  Over time they stopped respecting personal time and began making demands and demanding instant communications."
bad,"liked the job, just didnt like how hard it was to advance. only advanced if management liked you. very inconsistent. and lack of communication. and not enough workers to do the job,"
bad,"Applied to be a morning stocker, instead they needed a deli member more and stuck me there. It was the exact opposite job I applied for. I wanted to work inventory in the morning, not cook chicken and clean anywhere from 8 to 10 at night. Total lifestyle change I didn't ask for. HR is the one who interviewed me and put me there, so I was stuck! Deli manager had kids so she got the best shifts and never bothered to fully train. Better know how to swim!!"
bad,The company as a whole sucks. they make sure that you get less than full time hours so they don't have to give you benefits. If you are a college student looking for extra income this is the perfect place. If you are trying to support your family this is not the place for you.
bad,"I had applied to work with clothes (softlines) and got bored very quickly. Put away go-backs, folded clothes, organized clothes, and helped out in the dressing rooms. I kept getting relocated in the store without my consent. They moved me from softlines to food section, and then onto cashiering. Wasn't fun or even fair."
bad,You have to love working in retail and be lucky enough to have great co workers to make the job enjoyable because management can ruin it. There are so many corporate standards that it starts to feel like you are a number- only for my location and management. Had a great manager and team for a while and it was great. Management really can make the difference between feeling like you are a valued employee or just a pawn in the corporate expansion agenda.
bad,"The only thing positive I could say about working at Target is the coworkers, never had an issue with any of them. Management treats you poorly and loves to give you a hard time about every little thing. One week I’d get 40 hours of 4am’s then the following week 30 hours of a few 7 or 8am shifts. Then 12 hours the following week. Overall not a good place to work. Had me backroom to start like I applied for. Then crosstrained to presentation, absolutely despised it. Overall, that place will drain you of your soul and drag you down. Stay far away."
bad,"In a typical work day, one can be running around doing their higher up's job. You will most likely ask you to do multiple things in one day and continually ask for you to do more and you'll become stressed out. I have learned that some people don't respect the working staff at retail jobs. The higher up's have a tendency of scheduling you closing one day and then schedule the next day to do ad set at 5am."
bad,"Understand that if you are hired for this company, "
bad,"Discount Card. A typical day at this particular store consisted of management yelling at the team to hurry, Hurry, HURRY!!! In order to meet a unrealistic time goal. Pathetic."
bad,They don't know how to lead a team. The Management shares personal information about there employees and HR talks about private conversations that they had with the employees. I worked till I could barely walk and I never got any recognition. I was always the first one to work and the first one to finish. I picked up the slack off the managers because leadership was not being given.
bad,"Do not expect to come to Target and get ahead. If you have experience and are older (older than 25), do not expect to be a manager. Target caters to college graduates. Most managers are 22 to 25 years old when you have experienced people who are not being promoted. This company is unfair and pays people walking in the door the same amount of money that someone who had been working there for years. Run from this company. They will overwork you and underpay you."
bad,"At first its nice, you get a decent pay for a high school student and a opportunity to learn and gain new experiences. After about a week I noticed that the managers or Team Leads, at the store didn't bother to learn my name because of the insanely high turnover rate the store had. The training was so bad, I had to learn 90% of the things on my own or separately from the day I was officially ""Trained"" and this was a very common thing. Every couple of weeks there was a group of 3-10 newly hired people to replace all of the ones that left. When I was hired, out of the 7 people that were hired 5 of them left within a month. The workplace had terrible management and it felt like everyone hated everything about the place. The job itself was very easy, but boring. The best part about the job was the pay. Over the time I worked at target, I met a couple of good friends but they all quit because of how toxic the work environment was. I knew how bad it was but didn't care because I needed the money, but after the holidays ended I didn't know that they were going to cut hours the way they did. As a high school student I was working about 25-30 hours a week and that's more than I needed but I was happy with it. After the holidays they cut my hours, as well as my co-workers hours down to 8 hours a week. They didn't respect or value any of the workers because they were so extremely expendable."
bad,"There was a lack of career advancement due to not having a degree. In two years I watched seven different people be my executive and not have a single one stick around for long. The job can be stressful and you will work every holiday once you are a leader. "
bad,"Target used to be a fun, fast paced work environment, but over the last 2 years they have been looking for reasons to fire senior team members so they have to pay less vacation out a year.  Leadership has gotten so lazy that all they do is sit around and chat, they don't provide any help in the building whatsoever, even doing something as little as picking up a few boxes that fall in the isle off equipment."
bad,"a typical work day was very busy from the start to the end, One thing management could improve was not discussing employees out in the open where everyone could hear"
bad,I had to relocate stores and after that I never got a chance to advance they would always hire out. So chance of advancing in salary so I was stuck in a job with inconsistent hours and no benefits.
bad,the management is lazy. i worked in logistics so i did backroom rlated jobs ie. pulling product from the back. the hardest part of th job is having to your job plus others
bad,Needs better compensation in leaders interest in the development of their associates. Promotion need to be encourage and pay the difference when changing roles.
bad,"Target is well known for making its employees feel replaceable. It is a good job to get your foot in the door for retail but the management is power hungry and takes advantage of the lower positions being in a vulnerable position of hierarchy. My personal position has left me in a comfortable spot where job security is pretty good, however, the team is not professional and communication is almost nonexistent. The hardest part of the job is knowing that at the end of the day your quality work will go unnoticed but your slip ups will be announced."
bad,It was fun to work there at the beginning but when the head manager changed everything changed and they started cutting hours drastically . They would then get upset that everything wasn’t perfect but there wasn’t enough employees to do it all .
bad,"Used to be a better place to work at. Management is now kids right out of college who have no experience in either management or retail. Team members are expected to complete a multitude of tasks in short amounts of time with no help. They also kept promising a higher position, with training included, but never actually promote you. Wages were not fair. Best part of the job were fellow team members. Hardest was dealing with unreasonable managers and customers."
bad,"Poor executive decision making at the salary level. Company is run by its hourly workers who are paid significantly less, and rarely have the opportunity to advance. While some (much more experienced) salary executives are exceptional, Targets philosophy of hiring ""new grad"" external executives has created numerous flaws. They offer little other than the degree they achieved in college. Poor decision making forces the true talent to seek employment elsewhere."
bad,"very disorganized work environment. one time they gave me an 2 week vacation and after informing them i would be leaving a few days later they updated my schedule without telling me, so i had 1 day to go into work in the middle of the two weeks. I had gotten written up for zoning merchandise the way one manager showed me how to do it because another manager didn't approve of it."
bad,Not a bad job. But they will not hire full time employees. Only Part-time. Hours are horrible. Some weeks you'll get 30+ others less that 8. Easy job with great people to work with
bad,This wasnt a good job everybody did want they wanted when they wanted to much family working there so they didnt really get in trouble almost everyone has an attitude
bad,"The VIsual Program had just been introduced, and I was one of the first hired. There was no real direction, so it was kind of figuring things out on my own. SInce I have Visual and Retail experience, it was almost a good thing so I could create the roll. "
bad,The managers favor certain employees and its very easy for some to get ahead and others it never happens even if they are the hardest workers. very underappreciated.
bad,"I liked the work, kept me fit n healthy. but due to it being thru a temp agency, I only made $11 an hour and was made to work harder than the regularly paid employees. I felt like all that was missing was the whip. not many would make it passed the month. I completed my whole year and change. I was good enough to keep at $11/hr. but not to get their full pay. I am a 115lb female that proved I can unload the trucks by myself. I had to go."
bad,"Honestly the management was just all around bad, Which effected the way we worked as a team greatly. favoritism was being played with caused a great divide in those who should have been a cohesive team to get done what needed to get done."
bad,Was hired on for seasonal and got two days per week at max on my schedule. The only time I was ever scheduled more than two days is during the holiday weeks. I was never scheduled more than a four hour shift unless it was last minute because somebody didn't come in. Employees were purposely given 4 hour and 45 minute shifts so they didn't get a lunch break. Management didn't schedule people during the hours they were available and many departments are either under scheduled or over scheduled.
bad,"Target was a very fast paced environment when I first started and as time went on it got bad. we received new management and they had poor attitudes, rarely worked and made everyone else do their work, they would sit in the team member room on their phones."
bad,"Last chance job work there if and only if you have to.  You're treated as a number not a person.  Next to never appreciated by supervisor's.  Worked at the American Fork one, heard other stores are better."
bad,"I worked as temporary Christmas help with promises of part time work when the season was over. Even with decent business that part time work never materialized.. There is a very small group of employees with guaranteed work, benefits and a future as sales really decide whether one works ,or not, but overall management is treated OK and the general workforce are just numbers. One time working there is enough for me, as this only was a between jobs gig, until I found a real one."
bad,"Promotions seem to be random and make no sense because the managers might work out but probably just sit at Starbucks passing the time talking to each other about nothing."
bad,"very stressful place to work, the managers are unfair and favortist, expect way to much for the amount paid id rather work somewhere else and get paid less"
bad,The target I worked at was alright it wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst the days were long and went by slow and the mangers only gave work to people who would be willing to complete it so people they didn't like they were free to do whatever and people who were hardworking got all the work and made them over work instead of spreading the workload evenly and fairly for everyone and to get time off was terrible you had to go through multiple people and if someone said no out of the 5 people you wouldnt get the time off it was a nightmare for planing vacations or getting sick time off
bad,"My entire summer at target i never felt like i could be who i wanted to be as an indiviudal, it was all about become a target team memeber. no one cared about individuality"
bad,Like all the other docks I have worked on the managers treated cardboard filled boxes better than their employees.  When I obtained a second job they would not work with me.
bad,Management and team leads were there to look after themselves. Was one of the most stress full jobs have worked were they cut back staff but want just as much work done for little pay.
bad,"The environment working at Target was a little stressful. It is a big store and has a lot going on at once. However, there was always a PIC around to help with any issues."
bad,"Managers are very sneaky, both for Target and Target Tech. This is true even for the DM. It seems as though they only care about themselves and their own advancement instead of trying to help move up their team members. They tell on you to each other like little kids! To be honest everyone on our team is not productive 100% of the time, but I mean who is! We are human. I see the managers not being productive on many occasions. They will tell you one thing to your face and then tell you something different the next day just to be kiss ups. Commission is basically non existent. There is a points system instead of percentages. You have to sell everything and just pray for a decent commission check. To be completely honest this place is like being in high school all over again. You have the boss and the teacher's pets. It is very easy to tell who is who. I would not recommend working at this location at all."
bad,Some of the managers are rude and they aren't as flexible as they should be. The hardest part about the job was coming out of my comfort zone and talking to customers even when they didn't want to talk.
bad,Target was an okay place to work. Management was changing every week. I did work with friendly people. The atmosphere was okay. I would have like to have done the job I was hired for. They would change our job titles all the time. I loved doing floor displays.
bad,"ok place to work, but hard to get anytime off when everyone wants the same day off, ie holidays. people i worked with were fun and engaging. good first job maybe???"
bad,"Stressful job, with a high turnover in leadership. Often times promoting people who can not handle the job. Blame gets passed around and handed down. People were fun to work with, as all the employees were equally fed up with management. Very little movement or opportunity to advance career."
bad,Target is a great start for a person just starting into the job world would recommend for a beginner in the job industry. Can look forward to a great positive start for the start of your future.
bad,"a typical day at work for me is taking out the garbage, cleaning the bathrooms sweeping the isles mopping the isles running the bottle redemption area and help stocking items on the shelves"
bad,"A day as a cashier at Target consisted of you being harassed to sale Red Cards. If you sale 2 cards Monday you need to sale 3 Tuesday and so on.  If you sale the cards then the managers are your best friends, but then they criticize you daily when you don't sale them."
bad,Development and Training is terrible across the board.  Managers don't know how to do the jobs they are managing. Retention is horrible because the training program is nonexistent. Basically a sign off of papers.
bad,A day at work is unloading a truck at 6 A.M. for two hours then putting that product on the shelves for another two.  I have learned how to work fast in a short period of time.  Management is lackluster my superiors always take systems that have worked well and stop using them in favor of inferior methods. Also management is usually a new college grad who has never worked retail before.  The hardest part of the job is the constant lifting and dealing with poor leadership.  The best part of the job are the other people I work with on a daily basis.
bad,"I would never recommend this job. Horrible management, extremely inconsistent hours, no room for growth, and nothing ever gets done.One leader will tell you one thing, then minutes later another will come over and tell you another thing. They do not want to hear that someone else already told you to do something either. Very confusing, stressful, and over all not worth the hastle. STAY AWAY. Unless you do not care at all about your work experience."
bad,Due to some changes being made; such as self check out and other ones; Target has become very stressful and the morale just doesn't seem to be there anymore.
bad,"I was a cart pusher, I was out in every single type of weather . If it was raining heavily I was outside , snow I was outside , heat I was outside . ."
bad,"worked super hard in target, always helped out workers once i completed my area. constant complaining from supervisors and people not getting their work done on time. has to stay late over 2 hours after closing because of people not doing work."
bad,high stressed work place where you take over 100 customers a day back to back. Overtime being mandatory last minute a lot of the time. Could possibly be told that same week
bad,"Fun place to work, great people to work with. just make sure you look busy at all times. Talk to guest and let the guest know your there to help them if they need you. Have a clean work area if your bring a tub or flatbed on the floor."
bad,"3 days a week i unload, break down and push the items from the food truck.,2 days a week i make certain everything is full and pleasing for the guests.i've learned about retail. learned how to do displays, make labels,signs,etc.management doesn't seem to really care about the individuals.the team is made up of all cultures and genders.the hardest part is not the physical,though there is plenty of that,but it's knowing that no matter how hard you work and how much you accomplish it really is not appreciated.the most enjoyable part is knowing i have given my best, as always,and made an impact on the mission."
bad,Job was very stressful. Average shift consisted of doing 3 peoples job in as little time as possible.  There is absolutely no overtime allowed. Pay raises were not addressed in a timely manner.
bad,"Management is sufficient however not progressive or open to suggestions. No true opportunity for advancement. Flexible hours. Must be willing to work all holidays, stand all day, and lift up to 20 lbs."
bad,you did not get a traditional lunch period and they would not let you leave for lunch.  I was bring your own or eat food from a vending machine.  It was long days with very little time for a break.
bad,Maybe 10 years ago was a decent place to work at. The company has been cutting hours and hours/ payroll every year and it sometimes becomes really hard to do the job when there is no man power to help.
bad,Being in the field was rewarding but management is poor and caused a lot of turmoil.  Retail is a challenging environment to be in and has it facets that are worth it but overall not great.
bad,"You are not confined to the job you apply for, you will be working in just about every department there is, including cashiering a lot of the time. My experience, there was a lack of accountability, and not a positive work environment. There was a clique mentality, and it's clear how you get treated if you're on the good side or bad side of the ""cliques"". They do not allocate their resources efficiently, or play to your individual strengths. Rules, don't really seem to apply to everyone, and if you speak up, which at the beginning, they advise you too, you will get retaliated against. Example; I turned in people, committing time clock fraud, I was told who cares, and encouraged to do it myself. The store gets fined $700.00 each time someone goes over compliance, but if you say something, and that person is in the ""clique"", expect to be retaliated and human resources is not there to help you. I had my private information given away by an ETL to a coworker, I was scheduled to 10:00pm, and then open at 5:00am the next day, each time I brought up a serious concern to human resources. There is no training, you are just thrown into a department, and while most of the coworkers were very nice, and a pleasure to be work with, there is a lack of adaptation, and accountability from higher ups to improve performance, or strategy etc...."
bad,"My original supervisor was charged with embezzlement, I think, and his replacement was an intolerable egomaniac, but my assistant supervisor was a great guy. So it all depends, apparently, which store you're working, and under whom."
bad,"Management was only out for themselves, not easy to advance, hard to become full-time, schedules weren't made with work in mind. Work was not distributed evenly."
bad,"I ran the register, stock and straighten up store. I learn that it is very important to keep the store stocked and clean. The hardest part of my job was staying late and cleaning up the store. The most enjoyable was serving the customers"
bad,Management will say one thing then swear they never said what they said when asked by a regional manager. Always asked to stay late but then get yelled at when you now have overtime
bad,"I worked for Target early in my young adult years and quickly realized this was not the right environment for me. The pay is less than minimal, the hours are extremely unstable, and the management is a whirlwind chaos of fresh college graduates that have no experience in retail. I worked for Target nearly 3 years and always performed well in my roles and got along well with others, but found that many did not like the work. I personally found none of the work to be stimulating, though my coworkers were quite nice."
bad,"Target was a hire for seasonal so it still gave employees who were temporarily hired to have the same experience. However, there was not too much room for growth and only small bits of opportunity."
bad,"I didn't completely enjoy my time working with Target. The managers did not respect me as a worker, or my needs as an employee. They did not accommodate any requests and they did not attempt to help me when there were social issues with coworkers. They did not recognize my hard work and the managers picked favorites."
bad,You were always working and the managers talked about you to other associates. Nothing was ever done to the managers that were inappropriate to associates. They just blew it off.
bad,The manager don't no what there doing the store manager walks around with is hands in his pockets and don't help anyone and other manager there will help so times and hrs there suck and the pay sucks even more I will not tell any one of my friends to work there at all
bad,"I enjoyed most of the Team members I work along side. I did not care for Store management at all. They were very ""clicky"" and often bullied the lower ranked staff. I would not ever work at that particular store location again due to the poor management."
bad,You really have to kiss tail to get any hours. They only want to help people they consider friends and they always seem to ignore the ones that work hard.
bad,A typical day at work consisted of finishing the other employees jobs they have not completed out of idleness. I learned how to fend for myself and calm my feelings.  The management was completely awful due to their lack of communication and understanding of employees and their disregard for the employees safety and food regulations. The hardest part of the job was completing the task for the entire day on your own and completing unfinished tasks from the previous day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the connections I made with other hard working employees who share my feelings about this company and it's policies.
bad,"I feel like it would have been a lot better place to work if it wasn't for the management, and getting involved with coworkers (quite a few college students worked there)"
bad,"Target isn't a bad place to work, but I wouldn't recommend working there longer than 2 years. Once you get pass 2 years, you feel the negatives about the company."
bad,"Untrained management makes working at Target stressful and a challenge.  Company is organized, but people are promoted to supervisor without enough skills to properly motivate and/or manage a team."
bad,"At first target was a cool place to work at, but I started to see peoples true colors and it was ugly. The managers were rude and disrespectful to some of us frequently"
bad,Management is poor I got fired because someone came along with my ex and got me fired by saying I scratched their car when I was inside the whole time from open to close and didnt even leave the store even on my lunch break so. Terrible management for listening to some petty upset angry cheating ex.
bad,loved my job and what I did. however target cares more about the high up employees than anyone. I lost my job of 5 years because a new manager came in and decided he did not like me so he wrote me up for little things like washing hydraulic fluid off my hands previous to break. I tried to take it up with head management because I loved my job but no one cared to listen. They use to be an A+ company to work for but they've slowly started going down hill. I have several friends still working there. They love their job but say the management is awful. One good thing is their benefits though.
bad,The Senior Management team at my location were ill prepared for the positions they held.  Target's hiring model for executives is 50/50 experienced leaders vs new graduates.  This model works...follow it!  In the senior leadership positions it was all fairly new leaders.
bad,"Very fast paced work with little help"
bad,Target is not a place for minorities especially minorities who are women. The most recent store I was affiliated with practiced very discriminatory unlawful behavior.  It's no wonder why Target is adamant about not having a union because they are able to abuse their employees as they see fit and get away with it.
bad,"Target used to be a great job to have, but management changes have left unclear goals and shady practises in it's wake. No longer have a clear view of how to treat people."
bad,I voiced my opinion multiple times about ways to improve upon how to conduct my job and was told multiple times that it was up to corporate. It isnt a horrible place to work but it does get frustrating with certain corporate policies.
bad,"Great People to work with, but terrible compensation and company with little room for actually real advancement that means something lateral movement. Great place to start if you are manager just coming out of school with a bachelors degree. If you are starting from the bottom stay far far far away you are wasting you time and doing a greater amount of the work and all of the physical work in order to make the place work. Its improving from when I started however. If you are talented take your talent elsewhere to a company that will recognize your talents"
bad,"Enjoyed the work I did at Target, did NOT enjoy the management. I have trained several employees who were hired out of college and became my managers, but was never given the opportunity to advance myself."
bad,"Target used to be a ""fast, fun and friendly"" place up until new management started operating. Once it became about saving money vs quality of customer service it went downhill."
bad,"A typical day at Target includes getting a speech from your managers before you start your shift about selling red cards and providing excellent guest service. Your managers are constantly down your throat about selling red cards and it gets really annoying. I learned that inless your a really great salesperson and know how to talk to people, Target probably isn't the place for you. The workplace culture is stressful.  I found that you can't trust anybody and there are no secrets. The managers act like they are your best friends but they stab you in the back almost every time. The guests at the store I worked at are extremely demanding and very rude. If you say the wrong thing to them they go straight to customer service and you end up either getting pulled into the office, and/or getting terminated."
bad,"Hands off management style is nice. Empowers employees to make decisions. Typical days are mixed with meetings, day to day tasks and time for special projects"
bad,A lot of work to be done with so little time and so little workers. Management was good or bad based on how was managing the time during that shift. Pay rate can be better.
bad,If a manager doesn't like you - be prepaired to be talked to on the daily about things your doing wrong .  Eventually you will be fired. They have not a care in the world for how long you have worked there or anything about your family.  Terrible place to work.
bad,I worked for Richmond Target for about three years. The environment became increasingly stressful. Management was very unorganized and would even fight with each other. You get no recognition for the good work you did but got lectured for every small mistake. My manager was especially arrogant and used intimidation to get his point across. I only put up with it because they are very flexible with scheduling you and they pay you just enough so you put up with the awful environment. Management is terrible but co workers are all friendly and very nice people. Finally I decided to leave and am very happy with my decision. Many people quit all the time. There are a whole set of new people every month or so. Especially the managers they hate the pressure just as much as the workers do.
bad,"worked weird hours,  they chew you up and spit you out minimum. wage np benefits  and they are on the buddy system. no room for advancemen5. Not recommended"
bad,"Management team do not know what they are doing no control of everything happening in the store."
bad,They expect a lot of work out of you. The pay is okay but you're treated like a slave. They don't seem to understand that one person can only do so much. They're selfish and are only nice to you if you're doing what they want. Especially HR. Will lie to you and promise you hours but if you don't stay over or come in on an off day you are punished and your hours are cut. Don't think about going to school or getting another job and keeping your hours at target. They areThe pettiest people I've ever worked for. School reimbursement is only for managers. You can't move up unless you have a degree so the possibility of climbing up the ladder is only for certain people. And the discount is only 10%.
bad,"The Marion store had amazing team members but once you started up the chain, it all fell apart. Don't get me wrong, there were some amazing senior team leads and a couple great executive team leads but they don't last long because they were great. The store thrived on high school drama, rumors, and backstabbing and some of those in management were not exempt. It was fun in the beginning and then it turned to constant harassment and crying all the way home. I highly suggest not applying here unless you're desperate and keep your head down. Breaks were hard to come by and you're never leaving at the time your schedule says. There were some nights closing team would not leave until pushing 2am when schedule said 11pm. Target does not truly drive the ""one team one dream"" motto."
bad,This job will work you like crazy with minimum pay. If you are not friends with someone in HR or management you can kiss a promotion good-bye.  Target is good for building you up making you believe that the position is your and than hand the job to one of their buddies.
bad,"Target offered very little room for growth or achievement.  The pay rate was low to mid range at that time, and the job was actually quite involved.  Tests on speed and signing up customers for Target Cards were measured.  Atmosphere was fair."
bad,Target has changed over the years....Hourly employment at Target is best suited for high school and college students... Flexibility in work schedule works well for them.
bad,I didn't quite like working here the managers was rude and lazy they only worked when the bug boss came to the store for inspection and they never give you any hours.
bad,"Several times I would put in work off the clock to make sure we were able to complete everything and ensure the store was presentable for the guests to shop, but my boss is rarely appreciative and very ignorant of all the hard work that the team members put in."
bad,Reasonable pay for the work you are doing but there are rude customers and rude managers. Very good schedules for break.. 10-15% discount for employees .. no private employee bathroom so the bathrooms are gross because of people and children and you have to deal with it. If the managers were nicer I wish I would have stayed.
bad,"Give everything to the company 110%, team members 5-18 years of loyalty never recieve any gratitude, appreciation, recognition or respect. Unprofessional  senior management team and honestly sad and hate to say completely clueless."
bad,"Don't get sick or injured, keep the inbound boxes an inch apart or the managers will come to inspect why productivity has slowed, and the only way to get a good position is to be buddies with the GM or Supervisor."
bad,"Theres a lot of incompetence. Work can be super easy to super difficult. The desire to push red cards, while understandable annoys guests and often times guests want to be left alone until they have their own problems. Management has their own clique, lack of information. Compensation while high comparatively to other workplaces similar of this nature is not worth it to me to continue working there."
bad,"Management needs to be more strong.Workplace is pretty good enough but process needs to be more structured and organized."
bad,"The training is very poor and the management staff are straight out of college, with no experience in leading people. Management gets paid way too much while the working staff get paid pennies. There is no respect from management to the working staff. Very poor company to work for."
bad,The people I work with are fine but the opportunity to grow in that store is slim to none and it doesn't depend on work ethic but more so favoritism.
bad,"This store is under new management from corporate and now that whole store is going left. People getting fired and quitting left and right so now there is lack of teamwork due to understaffing. Also, managers allow harassment from customers because they are ""always right"". I really used to like this job but now it's become more of a stressful chore."
bad,"I worked at Target Mobile with only 4 other representatives. Sometimes only one of us would be scheduled at a time to close. This meant, if multiple customers were to come in at once during  close, they would be forced to wait until the previous customer's interaction was finished. This could sometimes take an hour at a time for some, given many phone activations can encounter errors and require a call to customer care. On top of that, our manager was easily irritable with guests. I can't count the number of sales we lost due to our manager's tone."
bad,"Spent at least 3 weeks at the Distribution Center for Target. Learned how to operate certain equipment but was moved from one department to another (MBP to Outbound) but I was released a week later after the department switch. Its been known that this Distribution Center has a quick turn-around (Hire/Fire) rate, I just didn't think that i would be apart of that."
bad,"Target has drastically cut back the amount of payroll it is spending.  It is their business strategy, but at the same time it stretches its employees to do more with less.  Management feels no compassion to its team members, they just demand that the work gets done."
bad,"They don't know how to treat employees with respect,they are not consistent with keeping work  organized they never keep employees no employee works there to long majority quits cause they don't give hours and robs employees of their time time and pay or overtime they only give overtime amd pretend to be nice with workers when cooperate gets on their case bout slacking off and not being able to run a well organized fast fun and friendly buisness they are totally unorganized just a shame for company with big name embarrassing company to work for at any time"
bad,"not sure if it was just my location but it was horrible , very high school like the only thing I actually liked about working here was how flexible they were with schedule and the fact that I shopped there a lot so after or before I clocked in i could walk around and do my normal shopping I would stick to shopping there and not working there!"
bad,I had a lot of problems with the management. Felt as though i was not a value to them rather as though a person who needed the job and the treatment showed they did not care and only cared about money.
bad,"So it's a job . They overwork you while being underpay. They will keep you part-time as long as they can . Oh , you can forget about taking time off too , they will find any reason you not to take time off."
bad,"A majority of the time we where understaffed in the backroom. way to much micro managing that screwed us over a bunch of times cause we where unable to get to daily operations. the hardest part of working at target was seeing co-workers and management standing around not doing their job. talking of the phone sending text messages or just chatting it up with another coworker while i worked myself to the bone. management don't give a care about you. all they care about at the target i worked at are red cards, sales and accuracy. but when the accuracy is getting screwed up but a few people they are unwilling to fix the problem."
bad,I had a negative experience with management and the inability to move me into a position I felt more comfortable In and able to show my expertise and steangrhs.
bad,"Simply the worst company to work for."
bad,"I enjoyed the experience but the management team was not diverse.  I enjoy the products, discount and pay. At my particular  location we have an attendance and hiring problem."
bad,Typical day at this store would start at 4:30 am. Help set up the line for the unload. Had some great leadership with this. New how to make it for smarter work. Push to floor usually takes around 7 hours. Leaving time for touch ups and support for the morning side team. Management could have been more involved.
bad,"Boring, I furthered my customer experience, management was inconsiderate, co-workers were depressed, the hardest part was going to work, I liked food."
bad,"I really enjoyed that Target had a good working atmosphere, but i felt there was a serious lack of challenge to the work, and it left very little room to advance."
bad,You are basically a slave. Treated like one and given instructions like a slave. Horrible work conditions and management will lie to you. This would be the best dead end job you ever had. All your managers are female and if your a male god help you.
bad,"ETLs are like robots"
bad,"Target places a high emphasis on their ""culture,"" but what they really want you to do is constantly network. You're expected to initiate and cultivate relationships with coworkers 24/7, even when the workload demands that you actually do some kind of work. Work usually involves regurgitating whatever is on the company intranet or something your manager wants you to do, without any opposition. If you can do that, you'll be fine. If not, you'll be labeled as a ""problem performer"" and be cut off, which is a method of ensuring your termination, because you don't have the resources you need to begin with so they further constrain the little that you have until they can fire you or you quit.s"
bad,"From day one scheduling is an issue. You do your part of submitting for time off/not to be scheduled and then be prepared to hound them until it's done or it never gets approved. Management is horrible. They don't care about your concerns because they'll just hire someone else. You may work 32 hours one week and 18 the next, regardless of whether or not you specified a certain number max hours. They may agree to schedule you certain days/hours but they'll go against their word the next week. Few are happy with their schedule as a cashier/team leader. Management takes care of their group/clique and could care less what they do to everyone else. All they care about is how many Red Cards you get and pressure you to convince the customer to sign up for them. Your employee discount only works if you use a red card or cash."
bad,"The work was exhausted, only upper management got rewarded, we rarely got a thank you. The Executive Team Leads (ETL's) they call themselves, had a college degree, but knew nothing about retail and didn't care to learn."
bad,"The Flow team job at Target is easy but the senior management are poorly trained in store operations.  Unable to balance work with available hours. Workers hours constantly being cut due to lack of sales, but manager unable to balance allotted store hours with number of employees resulting hardships for workers. Then when the work isn't completed the mangers blame it on the flow team members not doing their jobs correctly. Management is to concerned with being fast, fun and friendly. They also do not use the workers experience as best as they could. Target is all about the guest and no concerns for the employee. They hire good people then treat them poorly forcing them to seek other employment."
bad,I worked in soft lines and it was ok. A lot of culture clash a lot of favoritism and they could care less about your life. I told them I had limited scheduling due to my other job well they made me quit due to scheduling me anytime of the day. The head manager was irri and tried to stay on my head. Her people person skills were horrible. Everyone talked about her. She tried to be intimidating just because of her title. I walked out due to the straight disrespect and low pay for doing almost everything in the store. If the management would get their life together and stop acting like sociopaths lunatics then this would be a great company... Oh I hated those dang RED CARDS that only got the management an extra bonus at the end of the year.....
bad,It was a good job at first but after a while everyone seemed to get fired. I really didnt like the managers because they werent too honest and they had favorites.
bad,"It was a mix of things, great learning experiences with different positions throughout, slow promoting and job title addition. pretty good management team. team work an asset and lack of team work was the hardest part."
bad,"My experience at target in Cottage grove MN was laughable, the staff and coworkers were so disrespectful... And all talked behind your back."
bad,Had worked there longer than I cared to. Trained most of the employees and did the job of a few supervisors but didn't get the chance to move up because lack of degree. Even though I knew how to do the higher up positions better than a good number of the people hired.
bad,"While at Target in Kennesaw, I quickly noticed that there were many problems with communication between management/supervisors and line staff."
bad,"It was a very dull job with little variety.  Straightening shelves for hours on end is not a way of life.  It was an easy job, but incredibly boring."
bad,"The Target I worked at, I continuously found myself under the supervision of ""Team Leaders"" who were efficient at their jobs but completely lacking in people skills i.e. condescending tone, rude, abrasive, unforgiving with beginner mistakes etc. Upper management was nice but fake i.e complaining behind your back about this or that insignificant thing. I started on the flow team unloading the truck waking up at 4:30 to start the truck at 5am for about $9 an hour. The truck would have hundreds of boxes on it. It was hard on the body, a massive daily workload. The ratio of compensation to work is way off. It's clear why Target has a zero tolerance policy regarding unions when they take full advantage of people with this kind of back breaking wage slavery. The supervisor of the flow team was chronically complained about for their abusive and vindictive manner yet never removed from their post. I requested to be taken off the flow team for this reason alone after enduring almost a full year of feeling ill going to work knowing I would inevitably clash with this abusive person. During my time on flow my degredation was made complete when I noticed the interns or new upper management hires, who almost never rose up in the company internally but were plucked straight from buisiness school who seemed chosen for their youth and appearance rather than any real calibre or experience. These interns were given authority and positions over people who knew the job better than them, as if these people were so superior, so much more worthy and competent because they got a degree or were a student."
bad,"I would like to speak for only the location I have worked, which is in Hemet, CA. I couldn't stand the way management was run. employees are not backed by the management when it comes to customers, even if the customer is blatantly disrespectful or completely wrong. It seems the only people who move up are the ones that brown nose, work ethic i not involved. Honestly, the best part of my job was the normal employee/customer interaction."
bad,"Worked inbound receiving freight. I learned more from team members than management.  Team members are nice to work with. Hardest part is making a 100% everyday.  Enjoyable part of the job, the team members"
bad,"Firstly, I would make sure the entrance door is closed to potential theft subjects who would try to exit the store through the entrance way. Next, I would get my keys so I could unlock, locked merchandise in the electronics department. Then, I would log into the computers to set up the camera monitors to get a visual of the whole store. Next, I would put plastic blister tags onto locking pegs and would put on electronics stickers on items that are high theft. Then, I would take an audit on a list of items that are high theft. Furthermore, I would highlight the new discrepancies I had noticed in my audit and investigate on the whereabouts of the lost merchandise. Then, I would monitor by physical surveillance or live video surveillance of potential theft subjects in specific areas of the store. Then I would sign off on returned items to make sure they are accounted for as I close the store. Then I would collect the keys of my coworkers and their equipment and make sure it was all accounted for. Then I would close the doors in the store and put two rows of carts in front of the doors so it can prevent theft or a potential break in. "
bad,"big responsibility to pay gap. very low standards when they hire. hard to be promoted."
bad,"new management sucks. don't care much about there employees. best part about working in a store is the discount you get on some stuff in the store.  aldi is better than target because you get better pay  for the same about of work you doing , if you are living at home and don't really need a job then target is right for you but if have bills to pay will think about having two jobs."
bad,"I work mostly at night pulling auto fill orders for flow team distribution, the work is exceedingly rushed everyday due to it being very unorganized the only difficulty is in the uncertainty of having a job from day to day because of it and the massive seasonal job cuts. "
bad,A typical day at work was rather monotonous. I learned to not rely on the good nature of any supervisor. Follow all guidelines. The management is incompetent. Period. My coworkers were fine however some were allowed to get away with breaking rules and regulations while others were not. The hardest part of the job was the monotony. The most enjoyable part was the few good people and the competitive pay.
bad,"Working at Target was mediocre as expected. Days were very long (especially when closing), and your job title did not exactly mean you were working in that area for the day. For example: even though I was hired as a 'Sales Floor Team Member' didn't mean that I was scheduled to always work that area. The people in charge of scheduling would often put me as a cashier for a full day. This was definitely the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers and relationships you formed. Since you worked as a team to accomplish goals for the day, you were able to talk and form meaningful connections with peers."
bad,"I worked at Target for 2 years received 1 raise which was like 12 cents.. I started as a cashier and quickly moved to the service desk. It could've been the easiest job in the world if I worked with better people. They talk about keeping it ""brand"" and making the guest enjoy their experience but only 2 out of the 7 employees they rotated back there would actually do the job. And even when my work would get recognized by my peers, management was only interested if it made them look good to their bosses during walk throughs. Overall horrible place to work and in the end nobody I started there with even worked there anymore."
bad,"like the summary says, everyone has to start somewhere. Not a place you would like to have a career in but it is somewhere you learn a lot about work."
bad,"The work was hard, but was worth it. Had to work with precision and speed. Life heavy objects and such. Still found the job to be rewarding, the pay alright, and it was a good seasonal position. Overnight shift was a real detraction, and my reason for the low rating. Plus the management fear style I didn't not approve of."
bad,Target is a nice company to work for. They provide competitive pay and it is a clean environment... but do not expect to stay for long! Target fires 70% of people before their 90 days are over... AND when they fired you they do it at the very end of your shift.
bad,"This place is ok to work for, they nightshift was nice and most of the coworkers were nice. You must do exactly what they want."
bad,Great team members lousy management. Hot in summer cold in winter and management always expects more not matter what you did the day or week or month before.
bad,"There's always room for improvement, it would be great if they hired more managers and executive team leads that have more experience in the location they were going to manage instead of taking kids straight out of college with no leadership experience. "
bad,Typical day would be assisting customers needs and making shelves are fully stock. The most enjoyable part of the job was a working alongside with my coworkers and and helping customers. The hardest part of the job was moving up to a higher position.
bad,"Too much Kool-Aid. People get promoted off of fashion sense and popularity rather than meeting work goals."
bad,"typical day is clocking in, customer service, co-workers were OK. just make sure you keep track of your clock in times and you should be good for the most part. particular store i worked at wasn't the best in terms of management. they weren't really flexible with me as they would get mad whenever i asked for time off or the 1 time i called out sick. doesn't seem like there is room for advancement either, i felt stuck in the same position there with no chance to move up. bad hours and no benefits.would recommend this as s secondary job and not primary. im single with no kids and had a hard time living off the wage they offered but to each his own i guess."
bad,"Always punished for not meeting goals instead of rewarded for doing good things/increasing scores. Not told when we're being written up, so basically any time a supervisor says anything to you they could be coaching you. Try to shorten hours to because the ETLs get bonuses if they stay under the allotted hours, but then the store looks bad. They panic when we might have a district visit and try to get the store in shape instead of letting the district see how it really is. Managers talk to team members about their perception, but management has an even worse perception. ZERO chance of advancing. Very limited openings and they are always hiring from outside the company."
bad,"A typical day at work as a Cashier was while checking out customers I had to (bare essential of my job) ask every single customer if they wanted to sign up for a Target Debit Red Card or a Target Credit Red Card and mention 2 benefits about the cards before I was allowed to drop the subject. I was absolutely harassed daily, weekly, and monthly about how I was measuring up in terms of my metrics. The metric is only the Target Red Cards and speed of transactions. I hate to be rushed. Management also would hound you for your entire work experience there for you personally to sign up for a Red Card even if you do not want one. I learned nothing. The hardest part of my job was being constantly thoroughly harassed by management about Red Cards. The most enjoyable part of my job was in the month of June and seeing all the support they offer to the GLBTQ (Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer and Questioning) community."
bad,"I would be given a list of tasks that would need to be done. In the time I am there, I  would be pressured to move at a faster pace which would add stress to me. I have learned how to manage my departments' workers and delegate them when they need to finish certain tasks. I have great communication skills and have improved my people skills. I have been told that I can be a very good leader. Management  has never given me a chance to advance, Coworkers and myself have been talked down too, and has constantly changed.Hardest part is trying to go at a faster pace to appease management. The best part is some of my coworkers have been so supportive of each other."
bad,One of the most enjoyable parts are the co workers you get to work with. The hardest part are returns at customer services and explaining copy right laws about returning opened movies. Most of the management was good to work with.
bad,"Target isn't a terrible company to work for, but the nepotism is out of control. In the two years I worked for the company, I progressed up the corporate ladder to position of Senior Team Lead and was in their ""development"" program. In that time, I witnessed 3 Assistant Store Managers come to the store for training who were utterly under-qualified for the position and could not comprehend the job. Yet, they knew someone who got them hired so they had a management position. Yet they say they want ""the right person for the right job."""
bad,Would be a good job if you like to settle for low pay. Won't let you work 40 hours a week because it's full-time and they don't want you to have benefits. Instead you work 39 hours a week.
bad,My 3 years at Target La Plata started out exceptionally well but due to the management switching a couple times it began to go downhill.  My second year I was considered for advancement and went through the process only to never hear anything about it further.  I even asked and got no reply.  THe third year is when i knew I had to leave as soon as possible.  New leadership came in and made working the sales floor and practically any other part of the store a nightmare.  It was either her way or the highway and at most times came at the price of the team members and leaders.  There was no respect given to those who worked hard like myself.  From what I have heard it has gotten progressively worse there.  Id advise to stay away unless you're only there for a very short time.
bad,"I was a temp employee, I had no job security. I unloaded trucks and saw to the routing of the cargo. I already knew how to do the work, I was not as fast as some of the younger employees so I got replaced.  as a temp employee target didn't care whether I was there or not as long as the work got done."
bad,Started out great but quickly turned sour. Hours cut and no room for advancement. Talk of how good of a worker you are but not matched by hours or pay.
bad,"The hardest part was the inconsistency between management and non- management. My job duty was typical everyday from clock-in to clock-out. However, when management didn't schedule enough people for one shift the work went to others, which in turn, stopped the progress of your own workload. The end result is a ""coaching"" for not completing your own work.  Team work seemed like it was only for some and not management."
bad,"A typical day at work means coming in and normally switching out with another person and taking their place. Interacting with customers for the duration of my shift, making sure their drinks are up to par with what they expect. "
bad,Target is a great place to start out because you do not need prior work experience to work there. They have a very friendly environment and accepts all ages even for people still in high school.
bad,"Personally I worked in the Pizza hut portion of the Target cafe. "
bad,"During a typical day at work, I would clock in and go straight to a supervisor for instruction who would then send me to a cash register to work at. I would handle customer transactions and make small talk with them so they would feel comfortable. Of course I had my fair share of rude customers but I kept a positive, friendly attitude that would somewhat rub off on them. I learned how to work a cash register, be more patient with people, and pay attention to their needs.Management was very professional and were very flexible with hours. Although, I wasn't very fond of them after my time working there ended. My co-workers were all friendly people who I got along with very well, I even made a few friends with them. the hardest part of my job was trying to sell Target red cards and dealing with rude customers, but I managed both pretty well. The most enjoyable part of my job was working the cash register, being so happy to work there, and getting to see the different types of people that go shopping at Target."
bad,fast paced environment daily moving with the sense of urgency.completing timed work procedures.Great team member effort on every task.moving around a big stock room is the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part is working with a diverse set of people.
bad,"i enjoyed working with others"
bad,"Good for youth people, there's a low opportunity to grow. They bring people from outside just because they have bachelors degrees. Great company, bad mentality."
bad,"It was an alright job, there were some people that I could've done without, but you'll get that anywhere. Otherwise the job was fine."
bad,"This is a good place for the person just getting into the workplace, it can teach them about the corporate environment. Advancement should really be looked at within the company"
bad,If you enjoy working with people and working with a team then this is the job. The pay is very low and management is poor but if you need the money all of that can be overlooked I guess. You will deal with very rude customers and a disrespectful management team.
bad,Man its not the worst job in the world but definitely not the best its pretty lame its like people don't know how to have fun and get work done but the work itself was lame to don't get me wrong a very small percentage of people were actually cool and i mean small Like from the whole hand a pinky nail maybe even the edge of that location was horrid to super busy not enough workers worst part there's no freakin room for good ideas there basically like my way or the highway employees and managers couldn't give good ideas and brainstorm as a collective group on how to make the company better that's corny dawg the pay was weak mainly do to the fact your hours vary from season to season how do you expect people to survive like that honestly red and khaki is so tacky like i love red and i like khaki but without other colors its lame to me our employees didn't have a voice and if they did they got fired like for your opinion and the opinions really would be facts because the way they run the company is so bad its like if you could improve why wouldn't you i can't comprehend the stubbornness and stupidity seriously lol sorry i had to get it off my chest. AND ALSO THE EMPLOYEES WITH SOME OF THE HARDEST JOBS BEING A CART ATTENDANT GOING OUT IN RIDICULOUS WEATHER JUST ENSURE THE CUSTOMER'S HAD CARTS TO SHOP AND A CLEAN BATHROOM TO GO TO WHILE ALSO DOING CARRYOUTS LIFTING ITEMS SOMETIMES EXTREMELY HEAVY AND HAD NO HELP TO DO SO AND A MEANINGLESS THANK YOU THAT'S NOT EVEN HEART FELT IS RIDICULOUS LIKE SERIOUSLY I STOPPED DOING MY JOB SOMETIMES TO HELP THEM OUT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST GRIMEY!!!
bad,Its a fun place to work at first. The people are cool the management does nothing but walk around and pretend to be busy. Only 10% discount not too great.
bad,"A typical work week was at least 55 hours. I had even maxed at 70 hours at one point. Considering I was salary, not a good thing. We were expected to work from home and were required to ""volunteer"" for multiple projects and committees, both at work and during our days ""off"". In addition, we were often short staffed for Group Leaders (managers), so you were expected to do all of these additional things on top of managing a large team solo despite the workload being designed for 2 Group Leaders. Any hopes you have of ""work-life balance"" will be crushed immediately. Upper management does not care that you are a person nor do they care if you want to have any semblance of a life outside of work. This job is best for someone with no significant other or one that works the exact same type of job and no children. They hire straight out of college often as they are able to pay them less and for a newly out of college kid, this may not be a bad fit. My advice to those fresh out of college, be sure you can handle this environment. I've seen many a new doe eyed Group Leader quickly quit as they were completely unprepared and overwhelmed by the ""corporate experience"". The Target culture is a joke. They preach one thing, but the reality is completely different. Upper management were hypocrites. Expecting more and more from their Group Leaders, but often failing to deliver in their role. Many left early, hung out in their offices all day completely oblivious to actual operations (still collecting that big paycheck though), not showing up on Fridays or strolling in late and cutting out early."
bad,"was a good job,was cross-trained to get more hours but that does not happen."
bad,"Target isn't much different than any part-time retail job, honestly. In fact in a lot of ways it's better being that your coworkers become like family, which is great and in the area the pay is definitely competitive. However, if you do a  good job they will take advantage of that and give you more responsibilities without the extra pay and the hours fluctuate in an enormous way so if you need 40 hours/week, I wouldn't bother."
bad,"Pay is horrendous for everything they ask you to do.  At any given time you have 3-5 people to answer to, and upper management doesn't care about their team members. They take the phrase ""the customer is always right"" to extremes."
bad,"A typical day was busy and aggravating a lot of times. I learned about how to work the backroom and stock and find a lot of other material in the store. Management was terrible. My co-workers were decent people, made a couple of friends. The hardest part of my job was tolerating the management. The most enjoyable part of my day was getting off work."
bad,There is a trend in Target that they get rid of their team members that have been there awhile and getting more pay and benefits than the new hires.
bad,"When I first came to Target, I believed I found a great place to start building experience. And in the beginning, it was. I learned how to work the registers, self check out, as well as familiarize myself with the store when doing go backs. I loved talking to the people who came to my lane and making sure that they were all taken care of. I thought I was doing a great job providing fast, fun, and friendly service. Unfortunately, when it came to my two week report, it seemed like I hadn't been doing a good job at all. All because of those Red Cards. My supervisors then began being very adamant about my conversion score. I asked all the cashiers how they got guests to sign up, but none of their tactics worked. I found myself being talked to constantly and I began to feel very distressed whenever I was working. My supervisors were breathing down my neck, and suddenly they began talking to me about everything I was doing. They wanted me to talk to the guests the way they talked to them! Being a little introverted and shy, I had my own way of talking to them that wasn't overly pushy and in a nice even tone. Having a job that you're too stressed about or is affecting your physical health isn't a good job."
bad,"ETLs always seem to talk down to me like I didn't know what I was doing. I was the only person working this position who knew what I really had to do and they didn't think that training someone else in was necessary. A basic day for me was cleaning up after people...defectives all day because overnights didn't touch defectives at all. Had to deal with molding food products, fruit flies, and chemical spills pretty much every single day. Very stressful for one person, but the managers don't know that because they don't even know the basics of this position."
bad,Do you want to be pressured daily by inexperienced college grads about the lofty goals and ridiculous work load while being paid just a hair above minimum wage? Well my friend Target is the place for you. I was with Target for over three years and enjoyed it for the most part until I tried to progress. I was knowledgable and comfortable in nearly every department except the Starbucks and food service part of the store. I was hoping to eventually move up the ladder but after three interview attempts for minor promotions I decided to move on. This is a job for college/ high school students or for part time moms. You cant support a family working here unless your a part of mgmt.
bad,"I worked the 3 am shift unloading the trucks was supposed to get off by 10 am but some days it was 1 or 2 in the afternoon before we would leave,noone got along including management there were times that it was very noticable and out in the open. there was no room for growth and its hard to enjoy a job when everyone is miserable"
bad,"Pay was terrible! I worked there for several 5+ years and barely made over minimum wage. They want you to cover all of these positions, but don't want to pay you for it. Management at this store is TERRIBLE! If you're not one of their favorites, consider yourself screwed. If they don't like you, they will either try to push you out the door or cut your hours to where you don't have any so you can leave on your own. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with co-workers. They made the job fun."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers."
bad,"Pay was low. Hours received were very minimal. Management displayed unstructured, inconsistent behaviors/work flow. Co-workers were very nice. Job was simple. Loved the fast pace and helping customers."
bad,"low pay"
bad,Typical day I used to scan every aisle of the store with 3-5 other team members everyday. The hours were good 20 a week you can afford to survive. Now since they had their financial screw up on Thanksgiving. Everything has gone to down hill .My hours have been cut from comfortable with my husbands income as well not even ramen diet. Target has cut out alot of jobs and are keeping the bear minimum. Not a place to think you can make a living anymore.
bad,Typical days are easy but short. I learned how to man the cash register. There's way too much management and not enough actual workers. The hardest part was dealing with impatient customers.
bad,the bosses work with you a little whem they don't put you down they give you ungodly amount of time to complete the taks in order to complete the tasks you have to run through the store also they are an unsafe place for the customers on a truck day cause the palletes are stacked out on the floor higher then six feet
bad,"Behind many cut backs, Team Members are required to take on absent employees duties without the benefit of a pay raise for these extra duties. Over worked employees are hard to work with and stress and aggravation is felt in the work place by Team Members and Leads. Any training for theses extra duties is by trail and error and not illustrated, or a big book with the answers so you can copy in your book is given, a 40hr training is condensed to 3 days via ""The Big Book"", and signed off. Necessary equipment for Starbucks Team Members such as Ice Machines and Freezers break down and Team Members have to be VERY Inconvenienced until Target approves it to be fixed, weeks and months at a time. There have been MANY Team Member AND Leads that have quit in the last 4 months, thus MORE duties for other  Team Members to take on with out the pay increase."
bad,Target has a lot of friendly people but you only get hours if you are asked to take a lunch within 30 minutes of your shift ending. There is no notice.
bad,"I was cross trained on the sales floor and as a cashier, 95% of the time I was a cashier.  Management kept telling me I was doing a really good job and they were so glad I was part of the team.  When my review came up it was given to me by a manager who didn't even know my name, spelled it wrong on the review and rated me next to the lowest rating.  Told me they do that to everyone unless you have been there a year, (I had been there 6 months), said you are still in training and learning.  NEVER once did they tell me this is what would happen when I was hired.  I told them to keep the 7 cent raise since I would not be able to notice it anyway.  I learned a lot, was in a very busy super store, the lower level managers are nice and helpful, team members were really great.  You are not allowed to talk to your team members while working so hard to get to know them. You can not go to the bathroom when working on the register unless you call a manager, nothing to drink either. in 8 hours you get 2 15 minute paid breaks and 1 30 minute unpaid lunch. All team members and low level managers work extremely hard the entire shift, there is no goofing off by anyone. You are also expected to talk guests into signing up for the Red Card (credit or debit) if you don't you get pulled off the register and yelled at. The same guests will tell you items are on sale even though you know they are not you still have to give them the price they say it is, same ones abuse this policy all the time. Turnover is extremely high, that is why they have to hire all the time.  I usually had anywhere from 150"
bad,"You get to work with great team members, learn how to merchandise shelves.  Answer guest questions."
bad,Expected way to much for less pay. This job was a bit overwhelming but great people to work with.
bad,"Was thrown into the chaos on day 1 after I had finished cashier training. No information given on common store practices (layouts, zoning, endcaps, etc.) and was left virtually unsupervised and without a trainer from the start. Was able to manage due to previous experience with similar position at K-Mart, but would not expect someone making it their first job to do well. Store itself is very clean and welcoming, however, and part of the chaos may have been due to starting just before the holiday season."
bad,"TWDC gave no room for advancement, terrible hours and the management only looking out for themselves."
bad,"Following guidelines will become routine, and although not necessary a bad thing, it may get boring.  Best part of this job experience was co-worker relationships and helping customers in need."
bad,"Treat you like a kid, work short hours, very nit picky, no way would I go through this again."
bad,"My job duties as the  sales floor were to keep my area clean help every customers that was with five to ten feet in front  of you, build displays cashier and  costumer service  i learn to move fast and keep the area clean with out using to  much time the hardest part of the job is when we hit the seasonal time and we would be there till three am .The most enjoyable part was when the area was slow and u could keep ur area clean till u got to leave"
bad,Dosent pay good no hours its like high school all target care about is saving money and the company dont care about workers they hire anybody alot of people quit if the manager dont like you your fired quick
bad,"I am the assistant supervisor. My day starts at 7am. That is when I enter the cash office to begin processing the money from the night before. I sent out checks, order money for safe, put out start fund monies, and then prepare register bags for the evening. After that is completed I work at the front end and guest services with the cashiers assisting them with the guest. I restock and order so the end caps in the front of the store look good."
bad,"I was recruited into this company to work full time hours and promised that I'd get a TL lead if I caught on to their training. Well that training never happened. Quickly realized that wasn't going to happen bc unless you are buddy buddy with management it's not going to ever happen."
bad,"the management staff had very few people who were actually a pleasure to work with most of them take you for granted and pass all their responsibilities off on to the team members then take credit for the work.  The pat way poor, and the only way to move up was to stroke the ego of higher who only look at whether not you have a degree instead if your the best person for the job."
bad,"The people that work at Target of Bowie, MD are fun to be around and you have a nice laid back atmosphere. The downside is you are not compensated properly for the amount of work required for $9.00 per hour."
bad,Only worked during the nightshift and the leadership and co-wokers were horrible. The pay was okay but i cannot say much else as i only worked there for a short period of time.
bad,"Unload Truck, check in security, stock product, clean up"
bad,"If you get placed in a good store with a good leadership team, Target can be a fun challenge.  If you don't, it can be incredibly difficult."
bad,"When management would rotate (about every 12-18 months) the ""new"" execs were first very involved with all aspects, but a few months later they seem like they were out for themselves. When a hourly team member would voice concer about an issue it would go on with nothing done to fix or even acknowledge the problem. I personally would have ""quartly meetings"" with my HR. She again seem that she was not doing what was best for the company but what could advance herself. Many times she gave me the papers to put my two weeks in, which I did fill out after I found another position at another company."
bad,its not a good place to work at all...period hopefully this site will help me find another job asap
bad,Didnt have the time to do my job like I wanted to meet good people that would come and go 
bad,"When you first start working there, they assign you a random team member to train you on the basics you need to know for a few days, then put you on your own to learn from there.  When you ask for more training, you don't get it, and then they expect you to know what it is you asked to be trained on."
bad,"Typical day at work was clocking in, calling supervisor to see what it was they wanted you to do. Once it was decided you would do what they asked."
bad,"The communication in the store is terrible. The managers aren't on the some page. The team members are treated like garbage. If you don't finish your daily tasks, you will get written up. They change the schedule without telling you, so if you miss a shift you get in trouble. I would not recommend this job to anyone.  "
bad,"The time i was at target was possibly at the worst time, christmas seasonal, they expected too much from too little, with 150 carts and on average about 70-100 people coming through the store in an hour there was no possible way to keep enough carts in the store, the managers didnt think so, because all they knew was to yell at their workers rather than to see what needs to happen within a realistic manner"
bad,"A typical day varies in my department. I work in HR so the problems are different day to day. I start by printing and updating all reports and make sure survey/sales boards are up to date. I answer phones and direct them to the correct department, or try to answer myself. I make any adjustments to the schedules and correct any miss punches by team members. I make phone screens and set up interviews for possible new hires. I job offer them if they make it through the interviews, and also host the orientations. I key trainings and make sure all team members are up to date. I file paper work in appropriate spaces. I am in charge of cleaning the off stages, (ex:break room, supply closet). Also dealing with any replacements for call ins and any other situations that happen. I also work on special projects that come about. My management works well together. I always know someone will have an answer or can help me solve a problem. The hardest part of my job is trying to stay 100% available to my team no matter how long my to do list is. It is very important that I keep organized and stay efficient with my time. I love helping out my team. I enjoy getting to know everyone on a more personal level. I feel if the team is happy they will work better and stay positive. I make it a goal to keep my team satisfied, and that satisfies me. "
bad,"I have been an ETL for a year. I am now actively looking for another job and will be quitting in a few weeks regardless of whether I have one or not. Target's hourly pay is offensive. And that statement is generous. Today I had to give a team member a review in which the team member was rated ""Excellent"". Very few team members get this score (because of Target's skewed review system aimed to keep raises low). This team member received less than 50 cents as a raise after working for Target for over seven years. Meanwhile I come home to see Target ""hiked"" its dividend payout to shareholders. "
bad,"Had too many responsibilities for a 16 year old kid hired for seasonal"
bad,The hardest part of this job is the fact that we stand for the entire shift. Not enough opportunity for advancement in the company.
bad,My review of working for Target is lack of communication among management/employees very disorganized.
bad,"Tons of work for minimum wage. They say ""be Yourself"", and criticize you when you do. You can be fired for medical absences. "
bad,"Extra long hours, constantly changing workplace, and very hard to adjust to."
bad,"After this company, I sprinted back to college to get a degree. I couldn't go any faster. "
bad,good place to work as a first timer. learning how provide great customer service is interesting
bad,"Very busy, customer service, very friendly, very helpful, the customers, working fast it's speeds up the day cause we're on our feet all day."
bad,"If you want to work for an organization that sells you ideas about what leadership should look like, but fails to actually personify any bit of true leadership, then Target is the place for you. Don't attempt to have your own ideas or personality. Everyone in a leadership capacity is just a mindless drone reiterating the same propaganda, but is unable to comprehend what they are touting."
bad,"I started out working as a stocker and then moved up to a Level 3 supervisor. I loved working with the customers and doing my job but when I ended up becoming promoted to a salaried executive my life changed for the worse. There was no management support, the other executives had their own click and the store manager sat in her office all day long. I had the best numbers in the region as far as replenishment was concerned and that was all thanks to my over night stocker team. There is no team work coming from the other executives ever."
bad,Assisting guests and working on adjancies and best visual presentation of product. Being promoted after 4 months was very exciting. I have not applied for a management position. This is a short-term occupation until I find something better suited for my qualifications. My co-workers are very helpful and I have no complaints. The hardest part of the job was learning how to move product to make the best presentation possible. The most enjoyable part of my job is to see the end result coming out beautifully.
bad,"Worked very hard during my two months at target. Came in and worked countless times for those who needed time off but, in return they treated me just like another leaf from the tree."
bad,"A typical day at target is kind of uncountable. I learned son technique to apply in customer services and sales. but i have to learn it by my self. the management is the worst than any others competitor. The co-workers are really fun, but some others time they get tired and lazy. the hardest part of the job, most of the time the Team leader or management they only around drinking coffee or eating without doing anything."
bad,My typical day at work starts at 7:00 am. I walk around the store scanning empty location from 7:00 to 11 am. After 11 I have to take out any of the items that is said to be in the back and put it on the sleeves. I also help the customers with check out and finding items in the store. I work until 3:30 pm
bad,In My Opinion there are some members of management that are the best and some that are just the worst. I did in fact learn everything that there was to learn about my job. Most employees are great easy to get along with and that is what makes it a fun enviroment to be in.
bad,"Didn't appreciate its employees, unable to keep consistent and stable management team, employees didn't care to come to work because of poor treatment, unfair scheduling of hours, showed favoritism"
bad,Its an ok place to work part time as a college student but nothing more. I experienced shaky new management overall. There was a lot of confusion and miscommunication with the orders I received from their team leaders.
bad,"Poor raises, Management calls themselves leaders but they have no leadership qualities. Hard workers are tasked with more while other employees get away with poor work. No matter how fast you work it wasnt good enough, constant yelling and threats. Cut you hours without notcie and send you home in two hours to get their bonuses."
bad,"On a typical day at work, I notice that its most busy during the mid-morning and late afternoon hours. Most ""guests"" are soccer moms and dads, or friends of soccer moms/dads as 85% of the ""guests"" purchase items for newborns & young children. I learned that the Red Card is very important to Target, as I receive much praise and recognition for getting more than one in a week and/or day. Two of my co-workers have been very kind and helpful, and I really appreciation that. Some of my co-workers are stuck up and rude ( I assume it is because I am a new team member), but I smile at them anyway because I'm here to benefit myself, and they're just business. The hardest part of the job, is getting used to standing in one place for hours. In my previous job, we moved around quite a bit so its taking me some time to adjust physically. The most enjoyable, and also rewarding part of the job is interacting with the Guests. At the end of the day, it really is what you make of it."
bad,"I felt as though the people that work the hardest were given less hours. I came to work everyday and did my job, always asking for more responsibilities. I had a desire to learn more in order to get more hours. I started with 32 hours a week and by the time I left I had 21."
bad,"When management changed, the store became worse. Lately, the store manager has become much better than when I worked there. It was a lot of hard work, but it was expected of retail."
bad,I spent more time doing others peoples jobs because they could not do there own job and were not held accountable. This prevented me from doing my job. Although I still managed to be successful at my job. Every manager was held to a different standard depending who you knew and who you became friends with.
bad,"This job required a lot of you but did not compensate you in a way that was conducive to even compare marbles to marbles with what you were putting in to it. There were a lot of highschool and college kids that worked here that consistently spread rumors about one another. Management looked out for themselves and did not offer the opportunity to advance to anyone that wasn't in their ""circle""."
bad,"As an employee with great attention to detial, found that I was valued no more than those who didn't work as hard. Cannot maintain my fmaily as full time s not guaranteed and weekly hours change..Like that it is close to home but compensation too low and medical benefits still too expensive"
bad,Not a friendly environment. They do a lot Of cross training but also make unreasonable demands when you know all the different aspects of the job. Very little room for advancement
bad,Not enough pay.
bad,"There are many Flaws to the work environment at Target. The management is horrible, just watches everyone else do the work. They give NO hours what so ever, and it just isn't a kind place to work in."
bad,Target has changed with the economy. As with most companies during this economic recession Target is hiring however the payscale has decreased.
bad,My review on target working as a sales associate for soft lines was a good experience but also a very hard time. In and out the hospital due to complications of pregnancy because of too much movement.
bad,"Corporate management went in the complete opposite direction from when I started there.  The ""compete with On-Line"" culture, combined with the raise in minimum wage has made Target corporate take a ""More with Less"" attitude, and it's next to impossible to meet their expectations, especially with the added responsibilities."
bad,i think it just might be my experience with this particular target but the atmosphereis ok at best. i would not recommend this job to anyone who wants to wake up with hope for the future
bad,"I was an assets protection team lead which means asset protection manager for a center city store with less square footage than an average store. I had no undercover agents under me meaning I was responsible for all external and internal activity as well as safety and security incidents for just 19 an hour. Absolutely not enough for that role, and the kicker is the next job up has less work and makes double"
bad,"If it's seasonal, you'll get hours, but otherwise you wont get any. Management is clique, and they'll only like you if you work and they never know you. Everyone else is nice and cordial, since we're all dealing with the same stuff from the hire ups. Don't expect to be taught anything- you'll get reprimanded, and that's how you'll learn. The most enjoyable part is when you leave and get your paycheck."
bad,"Let me preface this by saying every store is different how well a store is run truly depends on the management team.  But for the most part, Target is generally only good for people who are looking for part time work.  Unless you are team lead or higher, you're not guaranteed at least 30 hours per week.  If you do apply, attempt to get cross trained in all areas, and the more flexible you are, the better off you will be."
bad,"The first year or so of working was great. After our boss was let go, new management took over and things went downhill. Rotation of ""overseers"" was not enjoyable. Extremely strict and uptight about littles of things. There were a lot of tasks to complete on short notice. No OT, otherwise a write-up. Hours became limited. Would not go back."
bad,"My team was great and I loved them. They would do anything for me because I treated them like people instead of cogs. My manager harassed me from the beginning in multiple ways and would tell the other Seniors that I was his best Ops Manager, because to be honest, I was. But behind the scenes he treated me terribly. He was mean to my team, so my team didn't like him and he blamed me for that. I took the harassment claim to HR and they said that he said he wasn't harassing me, so they had to believe him. It got so bad that I actually ended up in the hospital from the stress and anxiety of seeing my boss. The pay was great, but the harassment wasn't worth it. I had to quit."
bad,"This company drives for high training and skills development that gears towards guest satisfaction however, the company does refuse to gear its successes towards employee satisfaction. A great place to work at some days and not the greatest place to work based on frustrations and unhappiness."
bad,I worked for Target for 11 months and we changed Mangers 3 time while I worked their. The store leaders would harsh to cashiers if we didn't get Target red cards.
bad,"Typical retail.  Do what ever it takes to make customer happy.  Very task oriented,  management lack of experience causes many changes in direction and plans so flexibility is key."
bad,"It is a good company to work for only during the holidays when you actually get hours and can make money. The rest of the year, they promise you hours and you do not get them. They have no integrity. They are a greedy company that helps and gives to others, because it looks good. But trest their employees poorly. andaandanaandnotnotgthem, they lie and have no integrity"
bad,The company has gone down hill when it comes to their employees. they cut job titles and expect you to do everything that would normally take like 4 people to do. My supervisor was always flirting with employees and never did her job. They over work you to the point that somedays I'd go home and cry. Customers treat you so awful and the managers don't have your back at all. wouldn't not recommend this job to anyone unless it was as a part time job while you are in school or something
bad,"not managed, very loose managers. cut my hours after 5 years there, advanced other people and looked me over. other than that is was a fun to work there i enjoyed the customers"
bad,"The favoritism is very real, the reviews are what you'll typical see at Target. I was hired for a small format Target as a barista and then asked to be a Licensed Store Trainer. Sounds great, right? That's a negative. You get more responsibilities with no pay raise and you would typical get 40 hours at a bigger format but not even close at the location I worked at. Also, I was never certified for the position after being offered the position during the first month of employment. Team members were barely trained properly and often made drinks to their liking as oppose to the beverage guideline. The manager for our department was hardly there because he was managing the sales floor. Sometimes they would take baristas off their station to be on registers. Overall, it's not worth it, you get no tips and you're paid as everyone else."
bad,Very difficult to advance in security department. Pay can be better. Needs more organization and collaboration with management and security for a more effective result.
bad,"The culture overall is fun at time, hardest part of the job was being told to have employees complete something but not having the people to get the work done."
bad,Target wants everyone to hear about the great things they are doing. The news hasn't revealed that the people getting $13 p/h only get 16 hours a week.
bad,"I didn't really like working here but if i had to again, i would. Target is okay if you have absolutely no life. They don't care about your personal life when it comes to scheduling, so flexibility is whack. & thir employees are constantly playing around. NOPE!"
bad,"Working at target at the start was good, however the longer I worked there the worse it got, they would cut my hours when I got there for no reason and would cut my shifts without telling me, I wouldn’t recommend working at target"
bad,got to a lane then cheked people out. you don't get paid for a meal break which is 30 min long. the pay is good. i asked for more hours but they did not give me any
bad,I felt that I was undervalued and the management was not supportive in my development as a leader within the organization. I did not have a fair work/life balance working at Target.
bad,"I worked at the Williamsburg location from June to December when I had to quit on the spot because I just simply couldn’t handle management anymore. Management would hire on new people and tell them that their baristas didn’t know how to do anything correctly (cleaning, guest service, making drinks, etc.) The other starbucks baristas are fantastic and great people. Management would quite frequently settle for a quick fix instead of using the trained and sertified team members they had and would frequently tell across the work place at the baristas I strongly advise that you do not apply to Monticello marketplace ."
bad,I took a job at 4:30 in the morning and they wont let me work in any other hours so that sucks. The TLs and all really only care about the numbers and not your true welbeing and if your happy which is a bummer.
bad,It was a good work place the people were nice and very helpful it was easy to catch on and if you didn’t no what to do someone would find you and help you
bad,"Company does not give you enough hours, company does not work with your schedule, company seems to discriminate against other cultures. I enjoyed what I did at Target however I did not like this particular job site."
bad,"Management made it incredibly to pick up shifts and request days off. We were told that no one could request Sundays off for any reason. Team leaders did not help out with daily work, more so micromanaged."
bad,i did overnight stocking the store. a typical day at work was pretty much-stocking everything that came on the trucks and preparing the store for when we opened. the hardest part was working overnight i had no life .
bad,The one I was at was OK to work at depending on how the manger was feeling. But I would recommend overnight because the pay was good but that's only if your young without kids.
bad,"Honestly, when I started at target it was a good company, the people, and the culture where awesome. Recently the company and management shifted away from focusing on employee quality of life and customer service towards solely on profit."
bad,"The company made changes that pushed all seasoned leadership away. Leaders were expected to change their leadership style overnight. At my store, nearly all Team Leaders left due to unfair expectations. Some of the leaders had been with the company 20+ years."
bad,"At the beginning really loved working there, until I no longer felt safe at work or valued as a team member. And with modernization hours went down and positions got cut. Definitely needed a better, safer and more stable work environment"
bad,"Been there almost 2 years, don’t feel appreciated and get paid the same as people who just started with the company. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone unless you’re looking for something to barely get by."
bad,"I worked for Target for 90 days and in that 90 days i was barely trained and was immediately thrown into the hardest sections in the store and was expected to do my job like I have been there for more than 4 months. They talked about open door policy yet when i went to talk a higher up about a manager i worked with i was shut down and a few weeks later was wrongfully let go on my 90th Day.  The Department Manager said that the manager i was going to talk about 2 weeks prior told him that i never finished my work, which was total BS, i was let go with zero warnings and or strikes. The hardest part of the job was the time limit given to employees to finish stalking there sections! Absolutely absurd and would not recommend this job to anyone who is looking to build a career."
bad,Working at target wasn’t the greatest experience. The first few months were okay but after two years of cashiering I grew tired of it and it was difficult to move forward once you did get promoted.
bad,I was hired as a temporary associate and was told when I was hired that there is a possibility that I could be a regular employee.  I was also told that I could reapply to be hired again.  I reapplied and my application was denied.  Management has higher expectations then is realistic.
bad,Target is a good first job teachers many skills on how to prioritize and make people happy I loved working there not enough hours and not something I am passionate about doing.
bad,Back room is small and very close corners. Not much room to work after the in-store delivery started out. Ship to store is a pain in the neck. Management yells and fuss at you to hurry up on the  sales floor and getting the truck unloads done. Pay raises are the only good thing done every spring time. Work environments are not the best thing nowadays.Quests are rude as heck.
bad,"Target is okay, it was good in the beginning but the leadership has changed so much that the “family” feel isn’t there. I enjoy my best hut sometimes come to work feeling like another robot."
bad,"As a first job, it was okay the first few months. It's a cold workplace with an obvious social hierarchy, making it hard to talk to other associates without feeling singled out. Eventually they started scheduling me less and less; by the time I put my two weeks in, I had only been working four hours a week, one day a week, despite the 20ish they had promised upon hiring. Moving up in the company is also near to impossible without college education."
bad,"I was fired for taking a sick day with 10-hour notice and going to the doctor, I ended up having pre-bronchitis. I have been prescribed an inhaler. but because I took a sick day it violated their 90-day policy."
bad,Yeah this place has its favorites! The management was terrible. The hours were okay pay was okay. People were fake and uncaring. Turn over rate here is huge. Not a place I would recommend..
bad,"The upper management at Target was the real problem.  I had no problems with my direct manager, but upper management wanted to get someone else in my job slot.  Some who get the cards that were needed."
bad,"Simple work, bad management. when overtime is available you make great money otherwise you're just scraping by. Management couldn't care less about your life and family outside of the warehouse."
bad,"Only was given 4-hour shifts two days out of the week. I received no formal training and was thrown into the workflow almost immediately. Management expects you right off the bat to be pushing merchandise at the same rate as those who have been there for years. On top of that, you will mostly be working alone, which isn't all bad, except it guarantees you'll be held responsible for your zone whether you're on the clock or not! You aren't allowed time for fifteen-minute breaks, the workflow is ridiculously disproportionate to the amount of time it takes to the amount of time they want it done. Management expects you to stock one box per minute including opening said box, checking it's content, retrieving its location,t taking it to its location, make room if there isn't already (typically overstocked), unpack contents, straighten up, flatten the box and repeat. Such activity for new hires can take as much as double or triple that time if you aren't already hauling double time to get it done. Supervising team is extremely bitter, anytime I spoke with a higher up they would walk aways mid-conversation without saying anything and only gave me very vague instructions. I was let go from this position for ""not meeting standards"" without anybody ever first coming to talk to me about my performance. I was let go because the manager was mad I didn't know a supervisor's name whom I never interacted with before. Said supervisor then got in my face asking rhetorical questions and threatened to write me up. Unbelievable. I asked where the fire exits were during a safety training meeting once"
bad,"Target does not treat employees right.i will not deal with Target, sorry Target has lost other employees as well. Part time emplloyees should be allowed the 10 percent discount"
bad,"Since the pay has gone up you have to more with less hours."
bad,"- lots of customers. some are rude and some are not."
bad,It was job I worked at temporarily nothing long term it’s retail so unless you love that type of environment. Pay and hours wasn’t great and it’s hard to get full time hours best to work it as part time job just from experience.
bad,This is a nice first job to expand your interests as you gain experience. But since it was severely understaffed you found yourself doing the work loads of 3 people on a regular shift
bad,no the best environment for growth the department i worked in was fine. the pay was average and the work was decent all in all its a good job for seasonal employment
bad,I would not recommend Target as a place of employment to friends or family under the current corporate management structure. Pay is OK to good but hours are being cut to average minimum wage.
bad,Great opportunity for high school kids. The hours were inconsistent. one week 30 hours another week 12 hours. The pay suck and no OT. Not a job to keep long term.
bad,"I learn from every job I work. This one taught me patience and more self worth. I can perform any position's job duties, anywhere in the store. And deliver outstanding customer service."
bad,"Like a bunch of other Target locations I've heard about, management is terrible. They do not credit their underlings for any accomplishments or ideas they may come up with. Very cliquey, it was like I was transported back to early high school drama days. The pay was better than you might expect from retail, however keep in mind they are not going to give you raises just to recognize your hard work, they will expect you to do twice what you do in return for a quarter raise. They publicly announced their plan to increase their minimum wage to $15, but are also cutting their staff in half or more to compensate. They are not raising the minimum wage out of the kindness of their hearts, your job duties will increase by 3-4 times the amount it was to make up for it. In summary, if you're a student that wants some extra cash regardless of how bad the job is you could do worse than Target. If you're needing a full time job to pay bills don't even consider Target, your hours could go from 40 a week to 12 a week at no notice."
bad,"When I got hired, I was excited to work here. The hours were okay since it was the seasonal period at the time, the co-workers I'm working with are great, and the work within the job was not bad at all. I started off as a ship from store team member, then moved to pushing items from the truck/unloading the truck, to doing practically everything it felt like. Everything seemed nice, then things started taking a toll for the worst. As time went on after the seasonal period, the hours started to get cut off, some of the leaders (not all) started giving unreasonable tasks for us to complete within a shift that was not remotely possible unless you were a robot. Things just became unrealistic and it made people start leaving and second guessing where the company direction was going with all of this: ""Why are they doing this?"", ""How are we going to be able to get these things done within x amount of time?"", etc. It starts to get to the point where you start not to care anymore and you're ready to move on from the place. Honestly though, if it weren't for some of the co-workers (some that have already left and some that are on border line/still here), I would've been gone from here because the amount of work they have someone do (at least in the backroom, not sure about the front of the store), the unreasonable expectation the leaders/company has within our store, and the fact we're doing all of this for what seems to be, in my opinion, not the greatest amount of pay. Sure, I've heard that the pay will go up in the future, but I'm telling you that ever since we had the pay go up from"
bad,"As with most large companies overall the culture has too many meetings, too much process.  People tend to get promoted too quickly and often are not held accountable for business decisions"
bad,"I was never fully trained before being thrown to the wolves."
bad,"this job was okay as for the work aspect of it, the job was not hard at all, very productive when by yourself but what makes this job not recommendable is the management and fellow employees."
bad,"The job was both a blessing and a curse. The team I worked with was amazing and I got along with almost everyone. I had to leave Target due to no longer wanting to associate myself with a management team who often disrespected and belittled the team, individually and as a group. In private and in public, around guests. It was unprofessional and humiliating."
bad,"If an employee of Target calls out because they are sick, you must have accumulated ""sick"" hours. If not, it's an automatic ""write up"". Enough of these and they'll  let you go. "
bad,"As a general merchandise team member, your day starts off just assessing the department you're working in for the day; collecting your go backs, how tidy the department is and stocking your department. The salary won't match what you do afterwards though, as you're expected to do all the aforementioned, become a back up cashier on call, assist any guests with any inquiries, keep track of your inventory in the backroom and to manage your department upkeep all at the same time. You are paid the exact same as a cashier who stands at one register and checks people out while you're expected to juggle 3-5 times the amount of work for the same salary. You'll only have a decent work day under an understanding manager for the day, but Target has an exceptionally rare supply of those so don't count on that as a saving grace. As of right now, this position isn't worth what they offer as compensation. Just apply for a cashier here, but remember to not except any position higher than this at the front, as the front's leaders aren't paid more or if so only coins more than a cashier but are accountable for 5 times as much responsibility."
bad,At target one week you might have 20 hours the next week 10 hours are very inconsistent and management is not understanding about anything that may happen
bad,"Management turned out to be very two faced. When I put in my resignation, they became very hostile and negative. Hours are very inconsistent; one week you'll get 28 the next 16. They increase their wage to a decent amount but you simply don't get the hours to really make a livable wage. The work load they give you is also massive and nearly daunting considering everything has a process. The only way you can finish the tasks are by ignoring their procedure.if you simply take you time and get what you can get done, they have ""talks"" about your productivity."
bad,"schedule wise is not good, management don't value employee, busy day, irate customers, but co workers are fun. They just need to change work schedule."
bad,"A typical day at work with Target is basically being asked to switch gears about 10 times in a shift. Employees I worked with had a hard time getting one thing done because they were pulled in so many different directions. Management all seemed depressed and upset all the time, gave no clear direction. The most enjoyable part of the job were working with a big team, the downside to that is falling through the cracks and being ignored. I honestly learned patience and not much else there."
bad,Enjoyed the pace of the job not the manager or the hours that were given to me at all also working in different departments that i didn't know nothing about or got train right
bad,target use to be a great place but as new management came in to power the direction took bad turns hours were cut. opportunity for advancement were favored towards select staff and if opportunity came the work was seen as unreasonable.or impossible.
bad,"The upper management (district and higher) change what they want from stores like a person with good hygiene changes their underwear. One day you're liked and the next day you're not based on how they feel about you, misinterpreted communication, and based on unverified opinions of others who have never worked with you. The new rollouts are cookie cutter and not fitting for unique stores. But who wants to admit a huge rollout is a failure even though turnover is ridiculously high on all levels. The pay is great but you're basically signing your life over to this company as there is absolutely no work-life balance. Also training is no longer valued here and neither are family oriented people. If you're single without a life then work here but if you are not then save yourself the headache."
bad,"Working at target so far has not been fun. I am about to quit due to managers. I work on truck in the morning and stock shelves the rest of my shift. My area to stock is bullseye and no matter how fast I go, some days I was running, I would always get yelled at toward the end of my shift. When I would go to leave they would ask if there’s anyway I could stay later and if I said no they would tell me that I’m not stocking fast enough and would give outrageous “goal times”. They would also tell me every so often that the person before me who did my job did everything in an hour and when asking for a name no name was given. Very upset with my job there great pay but be ready to run as fast as you can to meet your goal time."
bad,meh. Good job if your younger and need something quick. If you're looking for something long term I would try to find another route. They promise a lot of things to you when you start moving up but no matter how much extra work you put in you don't really see much.
bad,"Terrible place to work, however they pay weekly and have a lot of company perks. High quotas and no personal investment in employees. Training is nonexistent. It is what it is, a job not a career."
bad,Target at first was a very nice place to work. Then new management came in changed a lot of things and it became not a fun place to work at. Management was way too demanding. Due to that a lot of the people I was close to all left Target.
bad,"The position I applied for which would have made me more of a face of clothing at Target ended up something else. What I would refer to it is a glorified stocker. I am not able to use my fashion, style or inspirational skills that were so praised in my interview."
bad,"Be prepared to be stressed out, overworked, and underpaid. The raises are yearly but are underwhelming. If you want benefits, scrounge for hours. Management doesn’t really care how the floor actually works. The store manager doesn’t really seem to know what he’s doing. Team leaders can make or break you, and one of mine broke me. I left and no matter how my life changes, I’ll never go back."
bad,"Can be a great place to work under great leadership. Without good leaders, staff won't have the best opportunities for earning reasonable income. More suitable for students (high school or college) with no dependents or those seeking seasonal work for extra income."
bad,Target requires a lot of hard work and expectations from their team members. Almost everyone I've talked to at work has been looking for new jobs because of the stress
bad,Managers demand too much while seemingly not understanding the work or what they want. Will be forced to clock out on time yet chastised for not finishing work (even if they pull you to assist other departments)
bad,"The employees, depending on the department, work hard to make the guest experience wonderful. Management tends to be lazy and delegate every task to employees. Too many lazy managers."
bad,You can't have a nice experience working there with friend circles and people being lazy and not doing their tasks at all. These friend circles get more rights and their mess ups aren't looked at like others. Even higher ups are apart of this.
bad,"The mangers are never on the same page if you contact corporate nothing every get done. If you go hire up with a complaint about your direct manager you get written up and ""punished"". My manager literally told me I was being punished for telling the store manager she had done something inappropriate and when i told him she said I was being punished which is retaliation In was told she probably didn't mean it that way. The only reason I stayed is cause they pay 16.50 an hour."
bad,Alright place to start. No chance for advancement and hours are minimal. Too much stress for the little amount of hours worked and the pay given. Would seek somewhere else to work.
bad,"The expectation of work is ridiculous.  They expect you to unload trucks, unpack the casepacks at a rate of 40 per hr. In addition to this pace, clean your department retrieve go backs from guest services, audit your department for out of stock items, zone, organize and back stock all of your own department  merchandise as well as, pull all of your merchandise from  backroom. The expectation that 1 employee complete all of theses tasks alone each day is ridiculous especially if they only schedule you for 4 hours.  You stay in a state of anxiety and frenzy. The new man boy store manager is a rage maniac who has tantrums on Team Leads when a job is not completed by a team member.  Corporate will roll out some ridiculous expectation with unreachable daily goals and then it all rolls down hill from there.   They will change your hours and schedule with little or no notice sometimes same day changes.  You can get anywhere from 8 hours per week to 40 hours per week depending on your popularity. "
bad,Target is a place of upbeat work and strict managers. Some may be outgoing but Target is a place of employment as well as a fun place to work if managers run it correctly.
bad,"From my experience, this location is very toxic. The management seemed like they want to see you fail, and if you don't they'll trap you to make it seem like you are failing and then fire you. Target itself honestly isn't that bad, but management is horrible..."
bad,"I have worked at target for about a year, in two separate locations. Missouri and most recently in Minnesota. The most consistant part of working here is that you are expected to work as if you were two people with inhuman stocking abilities. "
bad,"Target seems only interested in hiring part time. They are big on we hire at 13/hour, but only give 16 hours a week if in general merchandise. Lack of Training is big."
bad,This was a summer job. Ok pay but definitely not the best. Management was very disorganized. Employees were not treated well. No work life balance and team members were unreliable.
bad,"It was okay to work there , the supervisors made it difficult because of them stressing you out about how many red card you got in the shift that you were working. I wouldn’t go back"
bad,Unorganized and not prepared for Canadian consumers
bad,"Decent as a temporary profession, hours are unreliable ,management is subpar no valuable benefits, fast paced work environment overall not a positive experience."
bad,They need to work on the scheduling of their team members. I haven't been put on the schedule for two weeks straight now and I feel that is unacceptable.
bad,"I started working at Target in September of 2018, I loved it for the first few months. In November I got my wisdom teeth removed and they made me work. My doctor told me I couldn't work, because of the medications I was on. I was told by my manager that its against their policy to give more than 2 days off work. Other then that experience they were very professional and kind."
bad,"Constantly standing and walking on concrete floor for entire 12 hour shift, mandatory overtime during the holidays months, mandatory hourly quotas that must be met"
bad,Love the diversity! Alot is changing so it’s not as fun and alot is required so hopefully you’re great at multitasking...you get a pretty decent discount
bad,"Most of your coworkers will be awesome people working towards the same goal, but management will get worse and worse as time passes and your goals will only get harder to achieve."
bad,"Hard to make full time hours unless you fill a certain role or management favors you. Company is changing dramatically. Good for the guest, but not necessarily for the employment side"
bad,"Warehouse order picker in a fast moving environment working 11.5 hour shifts 6:00am - 6:00pm Saturday through Monday. "
bad,"A typical work day consisted of doing a work load that exceeded one person. With constant interruption form management. It really forced me to learn a multitude of aspects to the business, as a learning experience it was great."
bad,"When I first started working at Target, everything was great. We were always fully staffed and management was motivational and trustworthy. Employee recognition was very common. That culture motivated me to want to stay with the company and advance internally. HOWEVER THINGS CHANGED. Over time, Target gave less and less hours to its stores, reducing employee positions and forcing HR to under staff each department in the store. Not only were we working harder with less help, but management changed from MOTIVATING it's employees to MICROMANAGING them. Team morale and culture went down the drain and employee recognition became a thing of the past. It's a shame this happened to Target, but the truth is the truth, and it is what it is. Great place to work back in the day. Awful place to work now."
bad,Target was a low paying job with a schedule that was not flexible nor understanding of people's lives there was no opportunity to grow within the company.
bad,"Low pay, Terrible Hours, Management doesn't care. If you are a highschool/college student working here isn't bad but if you're looking for decent pay, look else where."
bad,I like the pay but not the team members nor the leads. I work in softlines(style) for a few months now and it’s the worst decision I’ve ever made. Working in softlines you have to help where help is needed even when you don’t have knowledge in the dept you’re going to help in. I had to jump into Electronics to help when I know nothing about it and it just frustrates me and the guest. The leads don’t care about you or your problems you’re just adding onto their problems. I’ve asked so many times to cross train to be told that “we’ll work something out” just to find out 3 new people are working in the dept I wanted to train in.
bad,"The slogan is much more for the employees than the customers. Target continues to slash hours for it's employees and demands more and more of the hourly workers, while not demanding the same from the salary employees."
bad,"Contributed to team success by exceeding team sale goals by 100%."
bad,job does not provide sufficient enough amount of hours to sustain living whatsoever. hours fluctuate too drastically. your pay raises wipe every year and you don't get paid raises for outstanding performances regardless of work ethic
bad,"management is what threw me away! Apparently my "" uninviting sad face"" is not welcomed to Target and I was sent home a couple time for being to "" uninviting "" It is my resting face but even then small talk WAS NOT allowed at target or was bagging for the customer . Walking around and cleaning your workspace was only allowed for 30 seconds , no small talk to other coworkers , absolutely dreadful as it was just annoying to be talked down to when there was no initial training !!!!! first day of the job i was shoved on a cash register and another coworker had to get in trouble to help me and TRAIN me when not even advised , ended up getting sent home for that as well. no training followed other then watching how to bag and that is it !"
bad,There is a process for everything which is good. If you follow the process you should be successful but that's not always the case. They identify top performers and bottom performers.
bad,"Team members are not compensated team members for their dedication and commitment to the company. I enjoy the interaction with our guests, allow it can be difficult at times. Goals and targets are not communicated on a regular basis. New team members are hired at the rate closer to those who have been there for a loger period of time.Promotion within the organization is unlikely unless you have earned a degree,"
bad,It has great pay and flexible hours if you are student. Unfortunately the changes taken place at target has created an undesirable work environment that doesnt appeal to much to the employees.
bad,"Horrible management, poorly run, employees are not compensated correctly for the large workloads they are given by managers. The managers tend to just sit around and talk."
bad,You get a decent discount 10% or 15% if you have a red card. The fitting room is a joke there is no attendant and the guest have an unlimited amount they can take in. The reshop that comes from guest services is always an absolute mess and they throw it in carts where it gets all mixed up and messy. You NEVER  really see any of your coworkers or have a chat in for the day from the style team lead ... no team culture at all for softlines. HR does however throw  in free lunches time to time which is nice.  CALLING OUT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE ITS IS SO HARD TO GET AHOLD OF ANY ONE FOR ALL SHIFTS. and it is a super inconvenience that we all have to be log into the my devices to answer customer calls AND TRANSFER CALLS. While  working on the floor! No body really trains you also you just get thrown into everything plenty of right on time learning.
bad,Target leaders only respond to Spanish people it’s a shame the guest gets very upset when they need help and they can’t get it cause the half the workers don’t speak English the sad part is that the human resource person is Spanish they need to get someone else there and they need to see how they treat other races
bad,"Very little training, poor communication, unrealistic expectations. The days were repetitive and you basically had to learn everything on your own. Stressful environment."
bad,"Nobody cares about your well being, they don't care if you have family business to take care of, most importantly they don't care if you're pregnant they would still expect you to get the job done (carrying 25lbs+)"
bad,"I was never properly trained to become a cashier, I went through the online mandatory training but never got the next step which was the in person training. They just told me to follow a fellow coworker on a busy Saturday and then was expected to know how everything worked. My worst experience was when I had pneumonia. I was barely 17 and I got bronchitis which turned into pneumonia and I could barely talk without having a coughing fit, so my mom called in and told them I couldn’t come in to work do to my situation. When I was recovered and came back to work, one of my managers said to me, “Yeah... it’s always fun when you have to have your mommy call in sick for you.” This man was around 30-40 years old. I would get comments from him like that about many other things and wasn’t comfortable in that environment. The entire work atmosphere was very chaotic and I felt like I was under pressure the entire time."
bad,"Target used to be a good, not great, place to work. With the introduction of a new program called ""Modernization,"" corporate is trying to deny any benefits to employees by only having part time employees. For someone like me who has invested years in the company, it has become increasingly obvious that I have no place there. They are looking for people who have no notion of work life balance. They expect open availability while only scheduling you part time. The ethics of the company have also gone downhill. Fire exits blocked. People working through their breaks. People working off the clock. All are overlooked by the management."
bad,Typical corporate climate. They get everyone to stress about profits even though profits don't make their way down to the employees who generate them.
bad,"Cashiers here really do get the worst job in the entire building. If you needed a manager to come over they would take 10 minutes making a customer even more angry then they already were since they have to wait. Half the time the GSTL’s were too busy talking to coworkers to notice that 5 different cash registers had their blinkers on with problems that needed to be solved. I applied for a job on the sales floor they hired me as a seasonal cashier but then said I could later switch onto the sales floor after 90 days. Seasonal employment ends after 90 days. They then kept me past 90 days, when I asked to switch over to the sales floor they told me they kept me for seasonal to be a cashier. Management made no sense whatsoever"
bad,"My co-workers were wonderful, but the management was typically sub par and made my overall experience worse. They tended to be very lazy and also incredibly overbearing, and also made no efforts to accommodate me while I was attending university, despite repeated requests."
bad,It's a job for a teenager. Low pay and raises are very poor (sometimes .15$) Management walks over you and expects more than you can do. Cut hours constantly.
bad,"During my employment here, Target, did not give any attempt to be schedule-friendly. Nor, did they care much about the work environment, it was almost soulless."
bad,Working at target can be stressful lots of call outs so they put extra work on one person that’s very unfair if you ask me. Then they get mad when you don’t complete a task that’s nearly impossible
bad,"When I first started at the company, I loved it. The hours were good and I was capable of paying bills. After a while, it all when downhill. The management got worse, the pay increased but your hours were slashed, you could basically get fired if you went one minute into overtime, the hours became more and more inconsistent, and honestly nobody seemed to care that it was getting worse. All the management cared about was getting their bonuses while the rest of the employees struggled to make due. Don't work for this company unless it's a necessity. I wasted too much time here. This isn't a friendly, caring company. It's a company that cares about their money and nothing else."
bad,"Target offers good starting pay upfront, but you will get no hours for about six months, until fourth quarter/holiday time.  Very little communication between any of the management.   I've been scheduled against my availability numerous times.  With the recent pay increases, they expect more work to be done in less time, and refuse to acknowledge that variables exist and can delay your work (such as helping guests, cleaning up spills or moving items in the backroom).  With these unreal expectations, I've had supervisors try and get team members to skip taking their break and keep working.  Lots of problems that are probably universal to most retail chains.  "
bad,"I didn't work there long but what I noticed was the "
bad,"You don’t have sick time so if you have to call off for that reason you have to use the PTO you have earned to cover yourself and it still counts against you. They use a “trend” system which basically if you’re manager doesn’t like you and finds some sort of “trend” you do you’re out of there. You’re always on your toes about your job if there is any reason you can’t  be there, doesn’t really matter what it is they’ll try and get you out of there. If you get hurt in any way they will try to boot you out ASAP most likely by placing you somewhere you’re bound to fail. Managers are dweebs and know little to nothing and micromanage. And there’s is heavy favoritism  that goes on there which can effect your work load. But if you don’t mind physical labor, don’t get sick, and can look past the favoritism the pay is pretty good. You get paid weekly and get get a target discount which I loved."
bad,The people you work with are what makes it worth it.  The management consistently shows a lack of integrity with how hours are distributed and how people are promoted.  I enjoy the fact that it is different everyday.
bad,Heading in the wrong direction. Not concerned with the grocery side of the business which drives much of the foot traffic in stores. Need to worry about freshness of produce.
bad,"If you are to apply here, just do cashier or price accuracy, because Flow gives you a barely workable work load. Like expected to work 8 hours of work into a 4 hour shift. It’s undoable. Hours are cut and can’t afford to do anything"
bad,The day began with a meeting to discuss what the previous shift completed and what we need to continue. After the meeting we were released onto the floor to start straightening the rows.
bad,"The work itself is not too difficult, however the management created a stressful environment where employees were constantly berated and confronted with wild expectations of what was physically possible in a time period. However, my coworkers were some of the most amazing, fun people I have worked with. A typical day consists of restocking your assigned area, assisting guests, and answering phones. Other work may be unloading the truck, inventory, and cashiering. The pay wasn't too bad, on the higher end of the retail pay spectrum, but as pay was raised, hours started to get cut."
bad,"Target has neat ideas and the environment is relaxing and comfortable ( as a shopper ). As a team member the team leads throw all tedious labor our way. Leads don't encourage by example. Most executive leaders try very little to establish a meaningful relationship. Some very good, well-meaning supervisors among the batch; a few good eggs does not redeem the dozen however."
bad,"I would not recommend working for Target.  With the direction the company is moving, there is almost no opportunity for career advancement or growth. Unless you come in and apply for a managerial position it is almost impossible to get promoted within the company at this point.Unless you apply for a high ranking position right off the bat or if you're looking for a seasonal job, I would not recommend working for target."
bad,"I would typically go into work at seven in the morning to work in the Produce department, a department that I was not hired for, and stock produce, break down pallets of produce, throw away expired goods and interact with customers. The management extremely strict with me for calling out for emergencies or being sick which was unfair, threatening my job on multiple occasions for calling out with valid reasons. The team members there were the best part, Target does hire great people but over time you see them progressively hate being in this environment in which everything is fake. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting great people. The hardest part of the job was unloading and breaking down what felt like 1,000-pound pallets of produce and other perishable goods."
bad,"No way to further a career working at Target, I tried learning new techniques and skills but was denied for over a year straight with promises of training. Getting 9-12 hours of week with not being allowed to learn other jobs is no way to sustain a living. It's a trap if you work for flow team and logistics with a management team that didn't allow growth. You'd most likely stay in the same position working there for years."
bad,"It’s a very friendly place to work for a low, yet decent I suppose salary. You stay extremely busy and the day goes by quickly."
bad,"Hard to have a life when one week you have 40 hours and the next you have 20 and you are hired as a full time employee. Management is good however, seems that each one of them is working on a different set of rules"
bad,"It was a great starter job for a student going through college. Hours are flexible, and schooling and family are considered important."
bad,"I thought I would love this job. Moved up from cashier to GSA and asked for a raise for the extra work got one for a month then was taken away from me. Asked to step back down and was basically told to keep it or leave it. There is never enough cashiers for the work that needs to be done. No cart attached. Prices always have to be adjusted, inventory is jacked. Customers can put a fist to your face and nothing is done about it. Its hard to be happy in a place that really shows that they dont value you. Your schedule can be changed at anytime without notice. The customers are frustrated which makes us frustrated. You can be stuck with new people on the floor and expected to finish tasks while training them."
bad,The typical work day would always consist of picking up clothes after every customer from the fitting room. The management was unorganized. The pay was okay.
bad,This company was terrible as was the management and employees! Nobody cared about anything but their jobs and nobody helped you out when you needed it!
bad,You get wrote up every other week for not being able to convince people to sign up for a red card. They give very little hours. They don't believe in advancement or learning another area of the store. they let managers cuss you out and keep their job.
bad,High stress work with little to no appreciation for job well done. Strong favoritism among management for certain Team Members. Too much emphasis on getting red cards instead of providing good customer service
bad,"First off, the manager in this department is prone to disgusting and unpredictable behavior that includes calling other team members names, gossiping, and making discriminatory comments. Furthermore, the higher management will do nothing about it. My time here has been stressful and exhausting. Around the holidays, you are highly valued and can work as much as humanly possible. However, once they are over, hours are cut down to less than half of what you started with and the rules and guidelines become very shaky and unclear. It is not widely understood what is expected of you, training is minimal at best, and management treats you like just a number in their system. Absolutely would not wish working here upon my worst enemy."
bad,everything was fine until we got new management. soon favorites were being picked and hours were being cut. no overtime and hardly ever any hours. shift change requests are always denied as well as vacation days unless you nag about it. lots of petty drama and unorganized work days.
bad,"The people were nice but there was always a lot of tension. They hire you for one job and then make you do a bunch of other stuff. It was annoying. Also, the discount is only 10% and you HAVE to pay in cash. It's dumb."
bad,"This place takes your very soul. I used to love the color red. I cant stand it anymore. It seems good for a little while, but management is always rotating so you wont be happy long"
bad,okay job okay hours but dont expect to pay a mortgage on them unless u get full time and those positions where lacking at the time of my employment there
bad,A fast-paced workplace for those who have never held a job. It's a starting point for those that need experience. It's something temporary and not long term.
bad,"Working in the back room, doing the dirty work, unloading trucks, and  stocking the store were the most  underappreciated jobs at target. management blamed us for everything.l wouldn't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,The store manager is a great guy. The HR manager is great also. Cant say much for the rest of management. The receiving manager needs to go. He is horrible.
bad,I was working in the back room of target just packing boxes all day. I wanted to be out on the floor getting orders for in-store pick-up but target did not have enough scanners for their employees. plus the manage came in the back and took video of us without our consent.
bad,"manage, train, hire team members for the bakery. Also set the production for the day. Did setup and layout for the bakery and store department. Manage the labor for bakery, ordering products for bakery and for for other areas of the store. The work culture was very stressful. The hardest part of working at target was the upper management, you didn't know who was running the store, high turnover. The most enjoyable part of working at Target was being the highest volume bakery."
bad,"This was just not a fun place to work, it is a lot of work for little pay and on benefits. I am happy that this experience is over. Managers weren't good nor was the overall culture of the place."
bad,"Culture is not the same, is all about money now, if you want to work part time this job is perfect for you but, be prepared  to work a lot under a lot of pressure."
bad,many people I worked with were very rude and disrespectful. It made it hard to want to go to work in a place where I feel well compensated for my needs.
bad,we were expected to just learn everything on our own with no real instruction so it was like going to work blind and you felt like a dummy asking the workers every time you needed help
bad,"Not a fun place for me.  Worked to many weekends in a row. "
bad,"This is my first job after a day when i landed Dubai, first day of work is a little bit uncomfortable since I'm new in Dubai not used working with another nationality and thankful that my colleagues are so helpful to me."
bad,In assets protection at Target there is very limit room for growth. I was passed over many times for promotions. The work was exhilarating and challenging.
bad,"Work life balance was bad, and during the liquidation was one of the hardest places to work but they are gone now so the review does not really matter anyway"
bad,"dias ocupados,clientes mui amables, buenos descuentos y buenos beneficios"
bad,Target was my very first full time job coming out of school. The pay was not great but I did not have any bills back then. I was still living with my parents.
bad,I am grateful for target for giving me a job but i felt the management ruined what shoukd have been a great work place. The managers get all the hours but the ones actually working dont get enough hours to complete our tasks
bad,This was a good job and I wouldve liked to stay longer but I had to move on to do better and now looking into something else that I can use my new skills on
bad,"Back room employees are run ragged...no respect. its go, go, go all shift.  To much attitude with senior employees towards new employees who are learning."
bad,Target it has its goods and bads. the good is you can get experience in every department but the bad is that you have to have a college degree it make an advancement more difficult.
bad,"The only good thing was that I liked my coworkers. It was just a job to earn extra money. I actually enjoyed the job for the first few years, then it became steadily worse, especially over the christmas holidays. No matter how hard you worked, it was never enough. Not worth staying and missing out on weekends with my family."
bad,Target was a crazy place to work as a teenager where there was always an abundant amount of over head pressure from the boss who was over you to try and reach some magical number.
bad,"I was given the opportunity to give them my availability, yet every week when I would check my schedule I was put on hours where I was not available and I would contact them and they said it would be my fault and that I had already given them my hours and that I could not be switching around which really upset me because I have other responsibilities at home."
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with at Target but I do not think anyone there is being compensated fairly for the amount of work that is put in on a daily basis.
bad,This job was such a pain and I hated it the absolute most compared to fast food I rather work in fast food target is somewhere I'd never recommend someone to work because of how rude the staff can be and just the overall stricken place its unnecessary to be that way.  The dress code was super outrageous and un acceptable
bad,I was never given the opportunity to give input as to the hours I require to do my job. I have been in the same position for 14 years. My management has little idea what my position entails. I was consistently asked to help other departments when I needed help myself.
bad,It's an okay place to work if you don't need a lot of hours and don't mind being told to do twenty different things at once. Unrealistic time expectations daily.
bad,"It matters to them if you give amazing customer service to the guest, which is a key role in your job, but they do not reprimand the people who have been there longer and are breaking the rules, While as new team members they may question your way with interacting with the guests and they might correct you for doing something you know your doing right."
bad,"This job is extremely bittersweet, the pay is extraordinary and a lot of the work-force is agreeable, but the management is extremely impatient with new employees, to the point where I suspect that the management alone could be responsible for the high-turnover rate in logistics flow, there also seems to be a bit of a well-groomed, highly-competitive and hostile work-environment, in which employees are encouraged to micro-manage each other based on what they each individually consider to be methodically correct, it leaves a lot of room for potential discrimination, misconduct, and harassment in the workplace, this in combination with the extremely frivolous human resources department is really bad for workplace culture, and it shows at Target for sure."
bad,Had the worst time working for this company. No opportunities for advancement unless you knew someone high up in the company. Hours are never consistent even as a supervisor.
bad,The work was fine it was just the lack of hours that made paying for bills difficult. Even though it was the holiday season hours were cut and averagely got 12 hours a paychec
bad,I enjoyed working here in the beginning until I felt that I was not good enough because of the amount of red cards I was getting. Managers are constantly pushing you to get red cards to save their butts.
bad,Overall target is a great place to work at but it can also be stressful and they don’t really work with your school hours or give you as many hours as the promise
bad,"This was the most ridiculous job I ever had.  Went to an overly elaborate orientation and was given a folder of paperwork for a job that wouldn't even last a month.  That same night at midnight we were expected to start a midnight, third shift.  You were expected to locate online orders in a half-lit store in the middle of the night type scenerio.  The first week was 40 hrs. The next week was maybe 10 hrs and then the third week was maybe 10 hrs.  By the 4th. week there were no hours.  The manager left me a voice mail, letting me know they no longer needed me!?!"
bad,"I did not enjoy anything from the company, there was always drama as if we were in high school, and management was unprofessional. the employees didnt work together, they did their own thing, over staff, under paid, would hire more people then what they could pay for, which led to people only working  one time during the week at only 4 hours a shift!"
bad,"If you want a corporate retail job with inflexible and often unnecessary rules this is for you. Despite being a student I was required to work 3 weekday shifts and 2 weekend shifts (they consider Friday a weekend day).  I was once written up for missing a shift that was added to the work calendar in the break room, even though I was never notified of the change. I enjoyed the fact that I could cross train in multiple areas of the store and took full advantage of that to break up the monotony. Most of my job duties included facing shelves, stocking, and providing guest support. One perk of the job was strictly scheduled breaks (they would yell at employees over walkees to take their breaks at specific intervals).  Pay was decent for a retail job, but don't ask for a raise or they'll threaten you with firing."
bad,"forklift driver meeting new people work four days a week cold in the winter hot in the summerworked in two departments tugger ,reach truck,tripple,clamp and slipe."
bad,"The company has a good vision on where they want to be, but lacks the management talent to carry it out. The employees are pretty friendly however management can be a little hard to deal get ahold of."
bad,"The TL and LODs give you a set of task where you need to be more than one person to complete everything. The abuse of power is an understatement, they’ve yelled at us in front of “guests”. They treat us with no respect and talk down to us. They take advantage of new members and make them do their work for them, claiming it’s just a “favor” then get angry when you don’t have time to help them. I’ll give the store some cred and it’s the team members, but of course it’s like high school and it’s like a soap opera everyday. When I had first started I would have 30 some hours and now I only get 12-15 hours. Which eventually got me a depressing looking check!! I barely got trained in my area. And then they threw me on the register to bare it out myself. Overall the store itself sucks, but the team members is what makes me stay. I honestly hope they get things straightened up around there for everyone’s sake."
bad,Great place to work and everyone is willing to help so the company can grow and projects are completed on timely manner. Company provide resources for the job to be done.
bad,I go home upset most shifts because of my leaders. They are passive aggressive and have favorites. It is NOT a good working environment. We keep getting more and more work placed on us and are expected to perform ridiculous amounts of tasks.
bad,Working fast passed at the receiving end of the warehouse had multiple times of merchandise stocking. Fun staff but lacked leadership and sometimes frustrating hours.
bad,worked at Target retail store for about 3 years and never gave the option for Full time. Rare chance for advancement position to open or become available.
bad,"I dont really have much to say, it was a nice getting my experience there after finishing school for Pharmaacy Technician in 2010 but they closed soon after i started."
bad,Advancement is limited and unlikely. They are more likely to string you along at a lower position for sometime before offering you a promotion. Seniority means nothing.
bad,I was not impressed with the management; some employees did just about nothing they were responsible for when others had to double up on work to catch up
bad,understaffed and overworked always helping out in other areas and the district managers did not know what was really going on.  The team worked hard together but are never able to complete anything
bad,I along with several other team member contacted Corporate after going to our HR about the racists and unethical things going on only to be written up or terminated
bad,I hired on as full time associate but seldom got full time hours only around the holidays. Management was not good very little training a learn as you go philosophy. Managers do not listen to problems or tell you to deal with what you have. Raises are long in coming and they do not honor their promises as the management changes constantly
bad,Target has a generally relaxed environment. If they get their staffing together then it would be perfect. They expect too much from a one single person.
bad,"My experience in Target was really short, 6 months. it is just a temporary job because the pay is really low. Nice experience dough. Electronic Desk is so entertaining an d interaction with customers the best experience"
bad,"horrible communication, didnt know when i worked half the time and didnt even know i was laid off because no one ever told me i showed up to work one day and they were like youre not working here anymore."
bad,They throw a hundred tasks at you & your under staffed team to do within our 5 hour shifts WHILE serving customers. The lines never stop & they still expect us to get THEIR tasks done. They never help us out even when we’re begging for them to do simple stuff. Ex: “Hey we open in 2 minutes & I have to finish this task real fast. Can you put down the chairs for me?” WE GET IGNORED AND TREATED LIKE DIRT.
bad,I loved interacting with customers I got a lot of  networking but the management was horrible I didn't like the I was treated being minority I was uncomfortable the pay could have been a little higher for the position .
bad,"Target is a good part time job for collage students,  The hours an benefits an be good but it can difficult depending on your store. One positive is there are usually some fun people to work with which can make the job tolerable."
bad,"Target expects you to work yr behind off for very little pay. They make you work til 2am, even though you were scheduled to work til 10p.m. You are also sometimes required to fix half the store alone!"
bad,Good job just the task that you have to do sometimes doesn’t add up with the pay rate but overall the staff was very nice and kind and the pay checks were good
bad,"There was one month training For managers at target. I trained in all areas of customer service, operations, overall store management, and logistics. Retail wasn’t my fit"
bad,"The Managers wanted to much of you. There are multiple LOD'S or basically boss'es throughout the day and they all tell you to do seperate things through the day and stack it on you and if you cant get it dine they chew you out so hard. These tasks they make you do are the most time consuming tasks too, it's just too much"
bad,Target was not a great experience for me the management treated me poorly and although I was compensated fairly with pay it was not worth it. They were not flexible with my school schedule and would often schedule me at inconvenient times which I discussed prior with them. I would not recommend target to anyone.
bad,It will pay the bills and the only reason I left was because I got hurt on the job. That is the part they did not do well in because I felt as if they were more concerned about me quickly getting back to work rather than my wellnes
bad,this job was always stressful cause there was no organization in this store everyday i was in a different department and most of the time i couldnt help the customers find what they needed
bad,"Target has a generally open and accepting hiring process for those looking to get their first job but I would not recommend it for any sort of long term employment."
bad,I worked inbound. I unloaded semi trailers by hand or by forklift. I worked the night shift. 12 hour shifts on Saturday night Sunday night and Monday night.
bad,Management does not care about the growth of its employees or listen to suggestions. They hire more people during slow seasons instead of giving hours to employees already there and asking for more hours.
bad,Target is a decent place to work at but they pay new employees more than employees who have been there for years get paid and the management is very disrespectful to their employees.
bad,"typical day...ER issues, scheduling, etc"
bad,Prefer not to review. Not interested in relating my experiences within Target Australia. Very negative relationship with management and employees imported from the US.
bad,"My time at Target was very hard. A lot of fast paced work was done in 8 hours during my time there, at first it was manageable, but as time passed it physically wore me down."
bad,Target was somewhat professional. A lot of inner worker dramas and management was horrible. There was always a scheduling conflict and a lot of the managers power trip.
bad,"fast paced    have to  get items out fast "
bad,"overall poor management with a very poor job culture where profits come first over wellness of employees, and creates a work enviroment that treats you poorly. Job Security is not confirmed even if you have been there for 12 months or 12 years."
bad,"The reason I did not work longer at Target was because of the poor communication from my superiors. I asked for reduced hours due to me having exams that semester, and they said yes. One week later, it turned out they did not reduce my hours, and I had to confront them about it to find out."
bad,"There were 3 Team Leaders and they never communicated with one another. I called out sick ahead of time to give them enough time to find a replacement and spoke to one of the Team Leaders, however for some reason they said I was a no call/no show and released me from work."
bad,At my time at Target was kinda rough. We went through a new manager who didn't know how to run the store. It was very difficult because there was no one who can really help you with anything. They'd make you figure it out on your own.
bad,the manager only care about their family member that they hired in anybody else they dog out or took hours from or made work harder while they and family member took long breaks
bad,"I worked for Target for a very short time. Was hired on as full time and never saw full time hours. The manager was extremely hard on us, and if you were asked to stay past scheduled time and informed him you were unavailable, he would tell us we were not team players and that you needed to reconsider your employment choice."
bad,Management gets worse and worse every year. Bosses don't listen to employees and just don't care about anything. Upper management is completely clueless and don't care to hear the truth. Everyone that speaks truthfully is labeled a problem. Good people and workers are forced out or to just stop caring.
bad,Bad management that makes bad decisions. Hours are cut or relocated on the regular. Vindictive supervisors. The only thing worth it is the people you work with.
bad,"Typical retail work, so nothing new or exiting.  This job will take advantage of you in anyway they can.  Like all retail, they will ask you to stay late, work odd hours, and pressure you to help them when they need it.  They will not return the favor. Every day will be 'an emergency', there will always be some new crisis and management will cut corners and take a 'someone else's problem' approach.  They will ask you to follow impossible time frames, do the work of three people, and will directly focus on making sure you aren't enjoying yourself too much.  They will always have time to ensure you aren't moving too slow, but they themselves will always be so behind and need favors.  The only upside to this job is that it at least pays slightly better than most low tier jobs of it's nature- though still not nearly enough to live.  So. Ya know, typical working class hero junk I guess.  Get ready to get a second job."
bad,"My first management made working for Target one of the greatest and most fulfilling things that I have done since leaving uniformed services. However, when the entire management shifted, so did the culture, and morale of the entire organization. If you fit their mold of Yes Man/Woman and are young and attractive, you will do just fine. But if you follow the rules, abide by state and company regulations, you will be ostracized and made a scapegoat for management's inept ability."
bad,"Store management would send workers home that were scheduled to work 6-8 hours after 2 hours to save payroll, not thinking about employee need to make a living or work needing to get product out to sales floor."
bad,"Culture lacks in professionalism. Leadership changes every day so there is a lack of consistency, this also hinders advancement opportunities since each leader (LOD) works with someone different each shift. There is some concern of favortism and lack of HR support."
bad,Unrealistic expectations of employees based on the amount of people scheduled each day to unload the truck. They expected a new employee to already know the process and wouldn't take the time to teach adequately for the employee to adapt to the new experience. Terrible management.
bad,Target is not what it seems. The management makes the job harder than it really is. Team members are overworked and underpaid. You will meet good people that may help the stressful days go by a little easier.
bad,"You need to apply for sainthood if you can do the job of Cashier at Target well.  ""Guests"" are verbally abusive often, and the management team will turn on you and throw you under the bus if they feel it suits their needs.  Unless you're a manager, the supposed ""benefits"" are nil.  They state that you need to work a certain amount of hours, and then the scheduler(s) make sure you don't get the required amount of hours.  You are standing the whole time, you are not allowed to have anything to drink - not even water - at your station, despite the fact that you're talking 98% of the time.  They will force you to do a sales pitch of the store credit card with each and every customer.  During the holiday season, if you actually get a blessed day to yourself, they will call you in to come and do more work.  Sounds great at first, because hey!  You need the money!  But then when it comes to getting extra hours on the original schedule, that's just tough on you.  My best advice is take this job only if there's nothing else available.  In California, the 10% discount just barely covers the sales tax.  That and the minimum wage hourly pay is not worth the verbal abuse and constant harassment you get from the ""guests""."
bad,I truthfully wasn’t a fan of working here managers were kind of mean and made it hard to work. Customers were very impatient and rude. Coworkers were also pretty rude.
bad,It wasn't trained in how to do the job I was expected to do and too fast paced and I found the job very frustrating to do and the bosses were not helpful
bad,"Target typically hires its executives externally straight from college, resulting in inexperienced managers making decisions for long-term store employees. They are moved between positions they aren't trained for and between stores so often that no location can ever have a cohesive management team long enough to make effective change. Then they quit and move on to a better company because Target is not a great work environment for millenials. There are practically no perks that come with this job. If you want to take a weekend off you have to work an extra one. Long hours to complete some random set of tasks a district manager wants done by the end of the week, then there is no followup from them. Anyone who made it long enough is then managed out so they can hire a college intern to take the job for less pay. Not to mention they will dangle the prospect of a promotion in front of you for years to keep you motivated, while expecting you to repeatedly train the replacement for your manager who keeps quitting."
bad,Target is a very fun place to work. Managers are very easy to work for as well as co-workers. We recently received a raise which was good but it is not enough to live on. I also think that we should get paid on a weekly basis instead of biweekly. Our employee discount is only 10% which I think should be more.
bad,"walked around picking up trash, straightening out department shelves, stock items. Assisted customers finding items. Worked nights was going to college classes during the day"
bad,"I had to leave for a death in my family i communicated that i was leaving and they told me to call when i returned. i called two weeks later, a day after i returned, and was told i was terminated due to them putting my absence as “no call no show.” Over the phone the person raised their voice at me and told me information that was untruthful. Im very upset with this company."
bad,"The pay rate is high, but the hours are inconsistent, so while the dollar/hr is raised, most team members are only getting 2-3 days. Store management is like a sorority and gives more hours to team members that don't even know what kind of towels Target sells. Only a means to an end until the entire store management team is disrupted. The CEO and upper corporate management seem cool. The CEO Brian Cornell gave all team members raises."
bad,The target I worked at was great until we had gotten a new manager. She was best friends with a team member and gave so much slack to the people doing no work at all. But me doing everyone else job was being pushed even easy un loading the truck and being in the backroom it was bad.
bad,logged in  went to warehouse part where you removed boxes from conveyer belt placed on pallets took pallets out to floor opened boxes and put merchandise on shelves before store opened.
bad,When i worked for Target i didnt like it. I had got hurt and they didnt want to pay for my physical therapy and my hip is still not well and they never paid me back from the meds they were supposed to pay for
bad,"As a Hardlines Team Member, you were never appreciated no matter how well you worked. All of the team members that I worked with had negative attitudes and pessimistic tones, making it hard to retain a positive attitude around them. Managers there had specific team members they liked to work with and weren't comfortable picking other people, making it difficult to advance in my career."
bad,i Left this cleaning job many years ago to look after my elderly mother . Target cleaning company no longer exists. I looked after my mother for fifteen years.
bad,"great company  to work for , management treat associate fair benefits are great vacation pay too ... but they do cut hours bad and don't like to give over tme out"
bad,over night in general is the worst shift to work. my co workers made the job more fun. target is a good company to work for. i liked the flexibitly .m
bad,"Target offers very competitive hourly wages, but in my time working for them my weekly hours barely rose above 14 hours a week, even with fully open availability. Since schedules were posted such we had to give 2 weeks notice for time off, I rarely got to take personal time or go on unpaid vacation."
bad,the work place was anti social. The management had there favorites. There was no room for improvement the management was very negative. The only good thing was the discounts
bad,Great advancement opportunities only if you look a certain way. Lack of fairness among peers and very cliquie feels like highschool. Company only offers 10% discount which is nothing let alone having 30 min lunches. Overall if you love to work and get taking advantage of your hard work and by management adding a whole lot other things other than your job description then this is the right place for you. It is a good opportunity for those that are starting work such as college or highschool students other than that it’s just a JOB.
bad,"It sucked and it still sucks. Management is poor, the hours are not enough and the pay is not enough to live. They keep firing team members and cutting hours/treating their staff like garbage."
bad,I didn't work at Target long. It was a temp job. I didn't enjoy it. Kind of uncomfortable at times. Wouldn't work there again. Not too friend with their employees.
bad,"Management is awful, employees are rude, pay is bad, they do not care about their employees but more about the customers. Pushed the stupid Red Card thing too much"
bad,Paid to do management jobs and 6 other jobs all at once . Management sucks. Treated like idiots. Not enough hours to get work done. Consistently understaffed and underworked
bad,"Managers do not care about safety. Repeatedly asked for months to have simple safety violations fixed. Constantly scheduled against availability. Constantly understaffed, especially on truck unloads. Managers preferred people not filing injury reports, and taking unofficial light duty. Horrible place to work."
bad,"This job was really too much for me. The management doesn’t care about anything or anybody but themselves. They’ll cut your hours if you’re honest. The ETL of softlines is a condescending, rude, childish, and mean person and I don’t understand how she is apart of management!"
bad,"Management is pretty terrible, and they schedule you at weird times. Bad scheduling isnt the best when it comes to looking for a good job, and even though the management has a nice face when it comes down to it they can be rude and have higher expectations then you think you can meet."
bad,"Little to no chance of advancement from within - new policy of outside hires with no experience. Have to quit and reapply after 6 months if you want a managerial position but no guarantee. If there is internal advancement, people are chosen based on favoritism. Enough hours are not given for employees to survive, even with $12/hr base pay. Because of this, schedules are created based on how much 1 person can juggle 3-4 different jobs at a time with little to no help. Workplace culture is extremely tense due to lack of communication from managers to employees despite constant changes within the company. Work schedules change without permission or notice. There is no training. There are no meetings to resolve issues. Management does not take responsibility for their actions, nor their team's. Leadership ignores grievances entirely. Airing grievances might also result in fewer hours given or gossiping among management. Target does not create a healthy or happy culture for their employees which makes room for rumors, stress, passive aggressive behavior, and ultimately quitting."
bad,"Their slogan says it all "" Expect more pay less"" Although I loved working with the public and the employees, if you did not conform to their environment, you had no chance to advance."
bad,Target is a good place to work for young high school or college kids. The enjoyable part of the job was making friends at the workplace. i would recommend Target as a good place to work.
bad,"good pay and benefits, but you will more than earn every cent. Little or no opportunity for advancement or growth . Has become a very stressful place to work. Co-workers are still great though."
bad,It's a job
bad,"Don't expect to get 40 hours a week, you most likely will get only 12-20. Unless you have a college degree and/or interned with the company you will not move up."
bad,"Just another Retail Store where you come in early in the morning, instructed to re-stock 20 shopping carts of returns than you have until 10:00am to complete a 100% inventory of the store, in between the mandatory huddles (meetings), which really eat into your productive time needed to accomplish everything before 10:00."
bad,"Working at target was rewarding because I Increased my salary quickly by being promoted from a checker to working in the cash office, dealing with numbers and money was what i was used to doing."
bad,its not that bad sometime i get less hours but i want a better job i have ben in target since 2009 i transferred to a new store because of me and a bo
bad,"There is a lot of labor that had to be done that was expected in 4 hour shifts. Hard to find a manger to be positive, friendly, and understanding in the environment."
bad,Horrible pay but expected to do way more than required. Management always undermines you. Never sticks to policies. only good for hs kids looking for spending money
bad,The managers force you to sell credit cards and threaten to end your employment if your credit card sales are not up to par. I would never work for this company again.
bad,Being forced to type a review on a company i have no interest in promoting is a silly tactic for this site to you. you end up with weird responses like this one.
bad,"I didn't even know my manager and we give these promotional $5 gift cards to people that earn them and with the lack of training I had, I checked out a family member and she earned one and later we used it with my team discount number and they thought I stole it so they asked me to resign and my remaining paycheck upfront."
bad,Managers have favoritism. They force you to sale REDcards. Which is impossible nearly because of the breech. This was the case at the Target I work for. All though I heard from other team members from other stores same story.
bad,problema de administração na empresa esse é o único problema
bad,come into work ready to get the day started. we mostly work independently without having to have our manager giving us direct orders on what needs to be done.
bad,"it was an alright company to work with. i don't think they work as a team as much as they say that they do, i didn't like how they management were not working enough with workers to make sure their needs were met."
bad,"Fitting Room Agent:"
bad,i would never reccomend working at target to anyone. yes the pay is good but the management sucks and they don't treat their team members like adults. mcdonalds would be a more professional environment
bad,Target was my first real job so I didn't really know what to expect. It was fast-paced and busy. The hours sucked but you got the chance to work overtime hours and make more so that was good.
bad,I worked as a cashier and I have not very much remembering. I do not remember much of the pass employer so as the time I worked there just briefly and quickly just temporarily not good job and not a permanent job as all I remembered.
bad,Lots of work for very little pay. extremely high work expectations for their workers with very little recognition and you might not even get an annual pay raise.
bad,Provided great first impressions and customer service Performed cashier duties including mobile systems Assembled and dismantled displays according to promotions
bad,"Working for target was okay until the last ear with them. I had 2 different positions, managers would consistently schedule me to work 6-10pm and then 4-9am  the next day"
bad,Target needs to give their employees more hours also more opportunity and I feel its a good place to work it's just not making enough money to live on and take care of the family.
bad,"Fun coworkers and management, nice place to work you see/ meet many different people coming into the store , you get discounts on everything . its a nice place to work"
bad,"I worked at Target as senior team leader and they love to ""sell you the dream"" and when you are interviewing HR tells you to sell everyone the dream. Target is filled with revengeful management and they fully believe in getting rid of anyone they do not like. Target is all bout clicks the management is typically young kids fresh out of college with no real management experience just a degree, this creates a bunch of poor leaders for such a demanding company. They treat there high performers as slaves and will find a way to get rid of them . Target is about high turn over, harassment , and poor management save yourself and run."
bad,This is a great jo for a high school student to learn about corporate America. The are flexible with hours so if you need a part time job this is the place to be.
bad,"Not a friendly or family like atmosphere. If you work an 8hr day you only receive a half lunch and maybe two 15min breaks if you are allowed to take the two 15min breaks. You have to have really tough skin and be able to control your stress levels. Which is very challenging at best. Management seems to be told that they should treat the employees poorly. The workplace culture is not,i repeat is not a team. They really don't appreciate their employees enough. And it shows with the very low pennies on the dollar pay raises/reviews. The hardest part of the job is dreading coming into work and thinking can it be any worse than the day before. The most enjoyable part of the job is some of the friendships you make with your coworkers."
bad,Worked early morning as a logistics associate. Worked for 5 hours about 4 times a week. We stocked the shelves with the merchandise we got from the truck.
bad,"You are treated like a cog in their machine, despite their many, many meetings proclaiming otherwise"
bad,it was fun a few years back when people use to have no problems coming to work. Things have changed for the worst the bosses don't know how to interact with their employees its just a lot of things going on in there.
bad,Overwork and under played but you'll have a team coworker workforce who becomes family. Overworked and under played. OVERWORKED AND UNDER PAYED. and you sometimes get free food? I guess that's cool.
bad,"While the job may seem enjoyable at first, you will quickly learn that unless you fit in with the desired ""culture"" of Target's staff, you will quickly fall behind. I was talked about behind my back and treated like a lesser person."
bad,"Horrible management, they expect you to perform unrealistic expactations, they mess up payroll and don't pay any employees what they really should be getting. I could go on..."
bad,"I was hired for the Christmas season and busted my butt for them, always came in when they were short staffed on my days off.  When the season ended I wanted to stay on as a regular employee and they gave me the excuse of “our payroll budget won’t allow it”.  They kept on only the employees that were butt kissers and they play favorites!! Doesn’t matter if you bust your butt for them or not"
bad,"When I work at target it was very hard to feel like i fit in. My manager was rude and would never have a positive attitude. She was very unprofessional, she would tell other employees my business. I was always to work earlier then I needed to be and always on time."
bad,"It was stressful and  some of the LOD's were very rude... "
bad,"A typical work day consisted of quick unloading and fast and effective customer service. I learned how to treat customers and how to work more swiftly. Management expected a lot from me but accepted me when I didn't fulfill to there expectations, considering they were unreal expectations. Workplace culture was friendly and caring, and the hardest part of the job for me was trying to reach my managers expectations while keeping my sanity. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job it self where i got to stock and assist customers."
bad,"I enjoyed working with good people but I couldn't get enough hours during the week to work. I requested to work but was given mostly weekends. I wasn't able to grow with the company although I was persistent. I enjoyed working the cash registers however, I needed to change it up and wasn't"
bad,"They're the only place still open on Christmas eve which was super bogas. Also, the management at my particular Target was not very friendly or organized AT ALL. I didn't even know I was laid off at first, I kind of just had to guess. And you have to use their red card or cash in order to get the discount, you can't use your normal debit or credit, which is mega lame. And when I started I said I wanted 15-20 hrs a week, they scheduled me for 40. They *might* treat the regular staff better, but I wouldn't know.  For what I could tell it really was a matter of the management of the Target was working for. Someone who had transferred from out of state said they were surprised how awful our store was."
bad,"Good starting job, very regimented, I would not want to work there after high school. There is almost no room for error and I find myself impossibly bored while working. Customers can be mean."
bad,Team leaders seem to have a lack of knowledge of the position they have. As well as a more than common tendency to overlook experienced workers for advancement opportunity. Hours are next to none and split between several different shifts in a week. Overall I definitely do not recommend seeking employment at Target.
bad,"the biggest issue that comes to mind is the company policy."
bad,"I was young when I first started at Target. It was the best thing ever, but then, as I grew older, the work became more and more menial. Going into work put me in a depressed mood."
bad,"Boring as can be, the LOD’s never leave you along and make working there depressing, but most of the other team members are awesome people and I’ve had a lot of fun working with them."
bad,"I was part of target real estate company for one year "
bad,"Monitored parking lot, collected shopping carts and returned them to the store entrance, assisted disabled and elderly customers with heavy items, stocked shelves, cleaned bathrooms, and did back room work"
bad,the management was the worst thing. The upper management was never on the same page and always had their workers doing different things rather than working as a team. Its very stressful when the store leader seem clueless about the day to day work. The compensation was good. They paid me 12.50/h which seemed really good since I was just seasonal help but it frustrated me that people who had work 3 or 4 years were making either less or the exact same as me. In any case it seemed like the management lacked connection to its sales floor staff. The best part about the job was the people. Ive made some good relations with people that even carried over into the real world after the seasonal help was terminated.
bad,"They do not promote from within. You get what you are hired for. I worked unloading trucks and stocking floors in the early, early, early, morning. The raise system works every 6 months with your pay raise ranging from 0-0.25. Its whatever the store needs or wants when it comes to your schedule. Its usually hard to get hours but it is a starter job."
bad,"never enough help, always being called from specific work area to help in another area...chaotic and stressful environment, very high expectations, very little encouragement"
bad,Target is a place you have to experience for  yourself. Everything is about profits without any other considerations. If you enjoy working at a place where you are strictly a tool then Target is for you.
bad,"Not only was I scheduled when I had school even though they said I wouldn’t have to worry they would also schedule me until midnight and then to be back in at 4 am, and when I brought it up they basically told me to pound sand."
bad,"Used to be a fun place to work, but management really don't care about their employees...they care about that bottom line and getting red cards...overworked and underpaid!"
bad,"Management was a big problem in an otherwise fine, if at times hectic, retail experience.  There tends to be a lot of micromanagement that effects work effectiveness.  Not the worst place to work, but bad management took a toll."
bad,To much drama it felt like high school all over again. I would set either outside or next to the door at night for 8 hours i would never have anybody call or check on me i couldn't use the bathroom .
bad,The environment the job itself and the managers where all lackluster at best and failure to meet my requirements as a job slandered overall as a tempo job its good but do not try and make it a career
bad,On a typical day I would start by locating all shopping carts around the outside of store. I also did jobs like helping stocking merchandise and sometime help check out.
bad,"Lack of Leadership from team leader in charge of seasonal employees.  All other seasonal employees received a termination letter, yet I was not given on.  According to current work schedule I was schedule to work, yet my supervisor stated I was not on his schedule to work. Had a problem with a younger full time employee that had a habit of talking more than doing his job and making unnecessary comments. An when reported nothing was done about it."
bad,"I was there for only a month. Tbh I could write a whole page on how I knew this place was horrible and I had a bad feeling from the start about how they were unorganized as a company to all of their disrespectful ways but I won’t. What I will do is say I helped the most beautiful guests(customers) in the world! Every person I meet was very lovely and sweet, my job wasn’t hard and my co workers were dope! Hardest part was standing for 8 hrs sometimes 4 straight without a break. The part that was really horrible to me was Management, but it is what it is. To me it was nothing but another experience and opportunity."
bad,"The managers had ""friends"" they would give the most hours to, or cross train. I was trained to work in food service, as a cashier, or at the customer service desk, yet they rarely moved me from cashier and knew I disliked the position and preferred the customer service desk. even when we were understaffed for the desk, I would work as a cashier and after a certin manager went home I was aloud to work the desk, because and I quote ""I don't want you there."""
bad,"Do more with less. Push as hard as you can, but you never get caught up. Constant battle to make payroll and get the store priorities completed. A few really good people, and a couple horrible leaders at the district and group levels."
bad,"I had to work the cash register, stock merchandise on the floor and zone the aisles each night up midnight and beyond until finished. I did not like it at all."
bad,Very stressful low pay and if you are seasonal even with a dr note call offs are not allowed and the time to get tasks done is not enough to do the job right
bad,I had moved around in job positions--started in logistics from making pulls to stock the floor--moved to domestics --moved to HBA--moved to grocery and softlines then final move was customer service on the front end-- cashier supervisor.  Management was too many chiefs and all not on the same page.  Hardest job was the logistics but I had fun with back stocking and setting plan-o-grams (modulars).
bad,"The shipping and receiving clerk position verifies and keeps records on incoming and outgoing shipments and prepares items for shipment by performing the following duties to quality and productivity standards. Operates lift trucks or hand trucks to convey, move or hoist materials to proper departments or areas."
bad,It’s was an okay job lack of help with management they pretty much Did nothing but talk to other mangers and walked around the store . Schedules were always messed up
bad,Lack of great management which led to some employees resignation and hours were cut at different times but management made sure employees of seniority were given full schedules
bad,"I was hired as a Beauty Team Member, which the job was basically nothing. You are a glorified stock person. I barely had any training , and was made to work the whole weekend of my first week alone. After my training was up my scheduled hours was 13 paid hours, for a week. I was hired as full time."
bad,fast-paced.  expect to have people ask you questions that you aren't qualified to answer.  try to have deft hands.  they REALLY want you to push their credit cards and you'll be sternly talked to if you don't.
bad,"Target is actually a great company to work for. It will can be a very fun experience, especially if you work for a great manager.  If you receive a not so  good manager, it can be a problem."
bad,I been working for Target 7 years now. The management is horrible. They hire people just fresh out of college with no knowledge of the job. They allow these inexperience operation managers to come out with stupid ideas. They speak about safety but really dont care unless someone hurts themselves. They dont use there BEST PRACTICE RULES at all until the best prantice team comes in the building. There is  no growth in the company unless you have bachelors or masters. No matter the years you have with the company. Its a shame how this warehouse has gone down the drain. It was way better 3 years ago. They need to hire people from the floor with experience that can do the job of the operation manager since we are already doing there job everyday. While they just stand in different departments with Senior OMs talking and making jokes.
bad,The best thing about working at target are the customers if you are a people person who likes to help others.Working at target it's usually laid back other times it can be stressful.
bad,"You do your job, plus the job of others. Management is far with their forms of recognition, but are quick to coach you in any forms of your performance."
bad,hired as seasonal. worked really well. got strep throat or something of that nature where i ended up in the hospital.  had a note from the hospital. when i came back they said services were no longer needed...thanks target
bad,"I felt it was poorly ran by higher management, too many personal relationships. Poor hours just to keep poor benefits. felt no support from human resources."
bad,Target is a typical retail job. Constantly fighting to keep up with people messing up shelfs and keep the store presentable. Also management will never allow you to work a full eight hour shift to avoid giving paid breaks and will also normally cap your weekly work schedule to 29.9 hours or less a week.
bad,they never stuck to anything that they said. They were not good at keeping people up to date with things or on the same page as everyone else. They were changing schedules without prior authorization.
bad,"truth be told, I really don't remember my year at target. the only thing that stuck was the last 2 months where we were horribly understaffed so we got full-time hours without the benefits"
bad,Target is a good job when you first start off work like while in high school or a part time job. They work with your school schedule and is good as a part time job
bad,"Favoritism ran rampant in my store. When evaluation time came around I was informed that I had gotten a “needs improvement” on my evaluation when I had always gotten “meets” or “exceeds” expectations. This followed an argument with my manager and she informed me that she could only give one 50 cent raise and a “meets” expectations to one person in the department. Also, management is hired right out of college without any retail experience."
bad,It was just a starting job for me while I was in school. Target was very flexible with hours around my school schedule. Pay is very low and I don't feel like you get the recognition from managers that you should
bad,I loved the company for the most part but not working for it they over work all their workers and don't care about them as much as they should it's a huge company I get it but they should pay attention to each employees needs and concerns when having to work there.
bad,To many things to be done at once need at least two people in a area to get things done. The main reason I left was the (LOD) leader of the day were just not understanding that people can’t do 6 things at once
bad,Target would be a great place to work if senior management were helpful and willing to work with staff.  Management was often unavailable or unhelpful. Did not train employees and forced others to do their jobs.
bad,I enjoyed the experience for the most part but it drag a lot of time out of you and it is impossible to get along with. I think the management there is awesome and I would recommend this place to a high schooler.
bad,"Team members are overworked and underpaid. "
bad,I had an accomidation that required me to be sitting for some of the time during cashiering and they made me jump through hoops to get this acquired. They complained when I needed a restroom break and got angry when you were not able to fullfill somethings in a very timely manner. Cashiers were made to go to a different department and stock their items. Never got out on time
bad,"Customer service based. Assist with purchases/returns. Speak with guests on daily basis. Fill in for breaks at cafe or service desk. Answer questions, handle merchandise. Greet guests, ring up purchases. Maintain a positive demeanor."
bad,Very stressful place to work.  No room for advancement within the store you started in.  Nepotism.  All employees in same positions not required to do same tasks.
bad,This company should be sued for violations of labor laws pertaining to pregnancy. they will find a way to either force you to work outside the laws or they will find a legal way to push you out of a great job.
bad,I enjoyed working at Target.  Just a lack of communication with management but overall its was fun to work there.  I also learned a lot from my team lead.
bad,It has very poor management. Team members are push to work faster but with not adequate tools. Supervisor are horrible in all aspects. Team members are put at unsafe positions on a daily work schedule due to bad equipment keep up.
bad,"If you're looking for a full time job look somewhere else. The hours are constantly cut and because of that, the store never looks nice. They are getting rid of specialty positions, which is what I was in, and I lost PTO. One of the worst companies I worked for due to management. I worked here for a year and constantly had to ask for more hours. Even as a cashier they wouldn't give hours out."
bad,"Target did not meet its quota last year and therefore had to cut back on man-hours.  This brought about shift changes/cuts and results in employees doing more work in less hours. "
bad,Started at 6 am. Scanned boxes all day.Management always hounding you to do more even though you ran out of work. All ways on your feet. pay is great if you stay there long enough.
bad,"id recommend for quick money but nothing long term"
bad,"I enjoyed working at Target in the beginning, but quickly realized that I would have no opportunity to move up. I normally worked 5 days a week and never got 40 hours. Even if worked 6 days still not 40 hours. And there is never an opportunity for overtime. Its very fast paced, and somewhat overwhelming."
bad,"I was only there for the Christmas season so I don't really have much to say about them. I did however, really appreciate the fact that they had a parking lot."
bad,"Target is a typical big box retailer with low pay and a minimal compensation package.  Hard work is not rewarded, however knowing the right person is definitely beneficial."
bad,"High energy workplace, long hours and very few and short breaks, not many career advancement opportunities. Clean and organized workplace & efficient."
bad,"nice friendly place at times but I don't agree with pay hours not enough pay or hours an benefits for part time or seasonal positions"
bad,"Managers when I was there had favorites and made no secret about it. If you brought a problem with a supervisor to someone's attention, you got chewed out and your hours got cut. If you called in sick, you had to find a replacement, but they wouldn't give you names/number of people you could call. When I found a second job and gave them my new availability (second job was willing to give set schedule to make it easy), it got ""lost"" multiple times and I was scheduled when I was not available, and they were not willing to work with me. Called in sick, was told to call back in an hour if I wasn't feeling better. Called back, was told to call back close to scheduled time if I thought I would be able to be in - I wasn't. Got a call after my shift was scheduled to start. Told them I'd called in - twice - they checked to see what had been noted and told me that they were not accepting call-ins from me."
bad,"fast paced workplace, management most times is not happy even if tasks are completed on time, they want a lot more than what you are getting paid for."
bad,"I worked in a professional manner to complete the task at hand on a daily basic. I learn how to be more productive, how to cope with all my tasks, assure and account for my responsibilities within my assignment's and for the well-being for myself and follow employees"
bad,"A typical day was about 11-12 hours. After working a 12 hour shift, you would think that people would leave you alone for the few short hours you have at home, unfortunately such was not the case. ETL is an awful job."
bad,"A lot of cleaning to do for the store.  When going in for the day, they would make us do workouts for the day before our shift would begin.  Pay isn't that great.  Would go in at 7 PM and would not come out till 2 or 3 AM.  Managers wanted the store perfect before leaving for the day."
bad,"Fast paced environment. Hard day of work especially in the cold and snow or rain. Expected to help other people complete their tasks, while receiving little to no help yourself for your job tasks."
bad,"very clean and organized.the workers were very easy to work with. Managers were very polite and professional, I wish i was able to make it a permanent job but because it was temporary i had to find other work."
bad,"o	Directly managed sales floor operations "
bad,"Poor company to work for, this company is for college student or high school also can work long hours. You will learn on how to work the sales floor and help cashier."
bad,"This is retail so around the holidays it was busy and unpredictable. Moral was ok, management was ok. I would recommend this for a younger person. I met a lot of people and made a lot of friends."
bad,Good job for people looking to get their foot in the door to to make some money in their spare time. I would recommend this for a high schooler or as a second job.
bad,"-Hard working job"
bad,"Very laborious, this job is for college students or young people in general. The only way to make something close to a living wage is to stay with the company for 10+ yrs. Employees are friendly to guests but not necessarily other employees."
bad,"Target is a good place to work at if you just need a job, not a career. They dont treat their emoployees fairly. they promise and promise and they dont keep them"
bad,"Its a fun place to work at, great people. But its retail. Expect to work on Black Friday, sundays & holidays. When holiday season is over, expect hours to be cut."
bad,managers there where the hardest part of the job. it was nice to meet new people and gain new skills through this job. t just doesnt seem like the best fit for me
bad,"Managers suck. Few of them will listen to what sorts of things you need for your lifestyle and ""flexible schedules"" aren't really so flexible in the long term. I've had managers imply they'd fire me if I moved my hours out of closing. Overall, it is NOT a good place for me to work at all, but I can see how people could enjoy it."
bad,"started off as a sorter and moved my way up to a supervisor with hard work and determination, training other employees, always lending a helping hand when and where needed"
bad,"Target Distribution Center has many areas that could use improvements such as working conditions, better structure to help everyone do their jobs more efficiently, and better management communication."
bad,"It was ok. Was only working there for 3 months. Associates were nice, but customers were rude. I helped ring up customer purchases and it was the most stressful job I had to endure."
bad,Standard factory job.Long hours hard labor under compensated for time and energy spent.Managers show no leniency or sympathy for any issues you may have to miss work for .
bad,The coworkers are great. Unfortunately many come and go as target is just another minimum paying retail job that doesn't appreciate people in the grand scheme of things. Besides holidays you will get inconsistent hours and a low amount of hours unless you are in a high position. Luckily many people try to give away their shift away which gives room to fill up your hours for the week.
bad,"A typical day is a fast paced day, as it was mostly busy ringing up customers of their purchases, as well as answering their questions.  On my feet for long periods of time."
bad,working at target you had no freedom to be yourself. you needed to follow certain rules and dress codes. they can take advantage of you and show no appreciation.
bad,Cart Attendants here are treated as bottom of the barrel. Management generally doesn't seem to promote an open door policy. Pay is low for the amount of work you do.
bad,"Unless you work at the Starbucks or Food Ave., your job is always is hanging by a thread if you don't sell Red Cards. They say they can't fire because of Red Cards but they get around it by saying something like ""Not being part of the team""."
bad,"The pay is not enough to survive on, you don't always get your breaks and you get punished if you work a minute into your lunch or overtime, despite being understaffed in your department. It's ok to work here for about a year or two maximum, then I would get out."
bad,"Too much focus on getting customers to get red cards, or target credit cards. I felt like we cared more about that, then the customers themselves. It was not the best job, but also not the worst."
bad,"overall i enjoyed but only for a short period of time. it was nice to get some experience at a retail store, i had fun, made friends and learnt to do a lot"
bad,"ETL's are not treated like executives at all. This company is all about the numbers and making more changes before mastering the ones they have already made. The hours you are expected to work are unrealisitc. Executives don't even get set schedules and you are unable to take any time off in November or December. Additionally, there is an unspoken rule that ETL's do not call out so if you are sick it is frowned upon if you call in. Target is a very difficult place to work if you are looking to have a routine or work-life balance."
bad,"I absolutely hated working here! As a soft lines associate I had to work too many departments and had no help. I love shopping here, but I will never work for another Target ever again."
bad,"You are overworked. Sure, you get a raise every April/May, but you are completely overworked. They train you in multiple areas and don't expect you to want a pay increase. Absolutely terrible management."
bad,"It seems that the new people hired in always get more hours than the people who have been with the company for a long time. They expect us older team members to preform as always and the new ones coming in get by with just doing the basics (if that) and are paid right at about the same as the longer term team members. Once your ninety days are up, it is harder for them to let you go, thus your job is a little more secure. Communications are poor in the store that I am currently in. Kind of like the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing."
bad,"In the beginning it is a very nice place to work. Perfect job for those fresh out of high school..but if you want to make money for rent and other things..don't apply. Management is terrible. Staff is nice. Customers are usually very nice. You cannot accept tips. They try to get away with not giving breaks. Strict. Poor management communication. Poor job scheduling. You do more work than what they describe to you, and do not get paid for your extra work. CHECK EVERY PAY CHECK, they have try to skimp me put of money. Good starter job, but that is all."
bad,"I worked a 2 different Target stores one in St. Louis and one in Springfield, STL was a fun and friendly environment great managers. Springfield store is cut throat with terrible managers like the hardliners manager, and d-bag of a store manager with a superiority complex. Now Target has some trashy benefits that don't come till 90 day after hire. and employ as few people as possible so closing time can be a rush especially in busy times, and there's no pity from the management."
bad,"part time and not a good start as manager left, HRD and RX management lack of communication and training, on call for sickness and not having a good experience"
bad,"I was told my position was full time, turns out i was only given 10 hours a week. Plus the management was not helpful at all in supplying more hours. I just wish they were more upfront with me."
bad,There is opportunity for growth if you can stick it out; however you better be good looking and plan on getting a degree at some point.  Management plays favorites and HR is useless.  Depending upon the Store Team Lead they may not even respect their own corporate rules so don't depend upon established policy.  Their goal numbers for the logistics department is entirely made up and based on fantasy; management just uses it as a stick to hit you with.  LGBT friendliness is dependent upon the region you're working in; remember HR is a joke.
bad,Let me say that if people wanted a card they would ask. I don't like the management pushing staff to get them and penalizing those who do not by cutting their work hours
bad,target made some bad decisions and now current employees are paying for it. each employee is wearing multiple hats to keep the job and work life balance.
bad,"After nearly 4 years of work I didn't see anyone from the store ever make the transition from a wage to salary position.Some working for more than a decade and never surpassing the role of ""Team Leader""."
bad,not the best of jobs if your seasonal they really tend to force you to sell red cards and base your job on it if your a cashier other than that its a ok job lots of people go through your line making the day go by quite quickly
bad,many changes every week. managers don't understand the workers need to make work flow easy. The always short staff and expect  job to be done on time.
bad,Not a good place to work.  Can't trust what management tells you.  Changing procedures even if things are working well even at the expense of productivity.  Unreliable and lazy employees get promoted while hard-working employees get all the junk work dumped on them.
bad,To show customer service skills and help stock the store at night as well as transferring to daytime cashier positions and showing up to work to give a hundred percent service to the customer.
bad,be a punching bag for customers who need to vent. pay is average for retail job. its just like any other retail job. if you need a job put in application.
bad,Very challenging business where you will learn a ton and grow..  Constantly changing environment.  It is extremely difficult to navigate the store culture.  Can sometimes have information overload and give too much feedback.  Hard to strike a good work/life balance
bad,"I am a team leader at Target and as a member of management I regret saying that its unfortunate how target culture and higher management has depleted. The executives are over entitled, uninformed people who lack the maturity and organizational skills needed to run a successful, well balanced store. "
bad,"The best part of the job is the coworkers, but that gets drowned out by the lack of recognition, and managers who are unfamiliar with the different responsibilities of each work center. It is a job, and with that, it is a good place to find your self in between jobs, but do not apply here thinking that you are guaranteed a fulfilling career. I feel like changes need to be made to give team members better benefits, and improve the morale of the workers who work hard to make sure guests have an enjoyable visit, and one that would make them visit again."
bad,"The hours were never stable.. Could have ten hours one week and thirty the following week...availability for advancement, but not a good pay increase with position."
bad,"Fun and friendly environment but not good management."
bad,"I worked for Target a total of three times in my life.  In the beginning (2001Holiday season) the atmosphere was great!  Customer service was key and excellent.  (2004) still doing well with atmosphere but customer service slipped  a little.   (2010)  No focus on customer service it was sales, sales, sales.  the atmosphere of employees was low moral and no appreciation from management.  very poor place to work for a career or in hopes of advancement.  "
bad,"There is no positive workplace culture.  "
bad,"A typical day at Target for me was interacting with customers, fixing my lane, and smiling to create a better environment for my co worker and customers."
bad,"You meet great employees at the job, lifetime friends to be exact. Target has the worst management system there is. Their team members are overworked, and they're constantly changing policy to ""improve performance"" but don't do enough to recognize their team members in a real substantial way. Often you will go unnoticed and unappreciated for the work you do at Target."
bad,"Work was could be tedious and repetitive at times without much of a sense of accomplishment. There is a good strong emphasis on customer-centricity, but Target does not really do much to assist its employees."
bad,"Target talks a lot about changing their culture and growth, but over the 2.5 years that I've been here I've actually seen very little of that. They move so slow even relative to other monolithic competitors. They really need to pick it up and change to stay relavent."
bad,"Good for high school kids, not a career move for an adult. Great for part time or in between job while trying to find something better. Overall cool staff but pay need to be better."
bad,Company had good progress for few years but after some time due to lack good management and vision it's fall down and faces financial crunch and also stage to closer
bad,It was an okay place to work for. Very boring. Seemed like even the team leaders didn't take it seriously. Could be more organized. The food court was awesome.
bad,"What used to be a great culture to work in, is now a terrible, stressful environment where priorities and focuses are constantly changing.  Target used to be the positive alternative to Wal-Mart.  Now its just a sad, stressful place to be."
bad,There were problems were they wouldn't hire enough people for the holidays and we would end up short staffed and end up working 12 hour shifts when we should have only been there 6 hours to unload the truck and then stock the shelves.
bad,"A typical work day at Target was very fast pace, I started off coming in at 10:00p.m to unload the truck with all of target's merchandise on it which was around 2,000 boxes which had to be completed in 45mins, next take a pallet jack with products on it to the sales floor to be stocked until the remainder of the work day."
bad,I worked for Target part time and the job was tough and fast paced. The store was always a mess and there was a lot to do for little pay. Maybe a good job for a teenager starting out but definitely not for someone trying to raise a family
bad,"I didn't have that many hours, but I didn't want that many hours at the time. It was more money than my previous job so I ha e no complaints about pay. Job Advancement is a slow and complicated process and job security is poor. Management goes by the book and treats everyone the same."
bad,You always had to watch your back. Management always relied on the more productive people to make the quota. If you didn't get the numbers they expected they rode your back.
bad,"My coworkers who were not my superiors were friendly and welcoming.  However, my managers and leaders on duty were rude, disrespectful, difficult to approach, and unfair.  Frankly, they sat around all day while myself and my fellow sales floor and cashier team members worked endlessly in a physically and mentally stressful situation.  Breaks were too short given a long work day and management did not adhere to my weekly availability.  For example, if I said that I could not work on Thursdays, I would still be put on for Thursdays and I would have to call out.  And when I called out, it was used against me.  I eventually needed to take a leave of absence, and during my leave of absence, they terminated my employment without calling me or informing me that they were doing so.  Overall, I am unhappy with my experience and would not recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"I have worked in the Target warehouse for almost two years. The work itself is easy, but the upper management can be a problem sometimes; specifically, with work scheduling as well as high expectations for a minimum wage job."
bad,"Retail, some people love it. It wasn't for me. They always had food in the breakroom. They had all employees on walk i.e. Talkies which was cool. Lots of friendly people"
bad,"Cart attendant. In summer it is really hot. Understaffed, I worked by myself. My supervisor was not there for us. No opportunity to advance.I also cashiered but they did not train me fully, so I had to learn as I went."
bad,you have to almost kill yourself to get moved up and if you're not friends with management then forget it. Schedule not reliable never she same sift hours or days makes it impossible to work 2 jobs if needed.
bad,I really didn't like my experience there. Management really looks down on the staff and doesn't care about the balance of work and personal life. My store had a habit of combing several jobs and severely understaffing to save money. My coworkers were all very unhappy with Target as well.
bad,The people are very friendly.. some management is very rude and demanding.. the expect a lot but give out a little.. Always hiring new employees when they don't have hours to give their current employees
bad,"Fast paced retail environment. Good company and benefits, however store level management left alot to be desired. Management can be rude and unprofessional."
bad,mostly  a lot of cleaning learned to keep myself constantly learniing and willing to explore differnent tools and have to travel to differnet locations
bad,the work work easy and i enjoyed meeting people everyday. I would recommend this job to someone seeking employment to help better themselves.I had the ability to work close to home and make good money for that reason.
bad,"greedy company, managers are not supportive, this company just wants the most out of their employees with the least amount of pay, they push amazing leaders out of the company with no remorse. its a great bs college student job."
bad,I didn't like working there they didn't pay enough money for the work you do. I didn't like management because they didn't know who was in charge. I hate target
bad,I liked it at first but it was a lot of work for so little people they needed more people the area i worked in was always a mess theu are always putting new product out but dont have enough room for it all so its very hard for customers to even get through the aisles with there carts.
bad,Could have been trained better.  When I would do something extra for the customer I was told I was in the wrong. Since I was seasonal worker I was offered another job before I was actually let go they it made it hard until I left.
bad,Target is an okay place to work. The team is okay. The guest usually gives a hard time. I had to leave this job not my cup of tea. The pay is okay for retail
bad,"Success at this job requires a fake, extroverted personality.  Skill and hard work are not rewarded.  Dishonest management ensures you cannot trust even agreements made.  Do not work here unless you are a millennial or not planning to stick around for more than a month."
bad,"great friendly place to work, as far as the customers go the employees how ever were rude and not so friendly lots of teenage drama. great seasonal job"
bad,"I started on the remodel team and absolutely loved it.Then I was moved to backroom stock and loved it even more.Once I was moved to sales floor it was okay."
bad,I worked for this company for 10 years and never hand a chance at advancement. Management does not care for employees only about the numbers. I hated it.
bad,Always busy to work here. I enjoyed the discounts but i did not learn anything new. No great benefits besides employee discoints. I would not go back to this place.
bad,you will never become a manager without a degree simple. you never stop working. Your always on your feet. i learned how to be a team player amd to never give up
bad,this work place was rushing everyone to get their job done. all of our leads just stood around making us do extra work so their bosses don't yell at them.
bad,Working cashier is tiring. You have to stand on your feet for a long period of time. Got to stay by your cash register. I just don't like it there and plus its uncomfortable.
bad,Like most large Corporations they talk a big game and the companies standards look great on paper.  When it comes down to an individual store level its completely dependent on the managers and supervisors and how they do things which varies from store to store.
bad,"This job was extremely fun at the beginning, then the company fired all the managers and replaced them with people that don't care about their employees. It's been many years since i've worked there, so I hope things have changed."
bad,"Cash out products that customers intend to purchase"
bad,"I cant say much for the Company as a whole, but at my store most employees are miserable.  Lack of hours and low wages are the main problem.  The job is simple, unload the truck, stock the sales floor and stock overflow in the backroom.  But there is to many mid managers and not enough people who can see the problem, assess the problem and fix it.  So it is hard on the employees.  We're understaffed everynight, yet nobody is scheduled 40 hours."
bad,This store has went through a lot over the last couple of years communication needs to be fixed. There is no confidentiality. This is a major concern to me. There is no team work at this location.
bad,Not a good experience poor work ethic just not a good working enviroment. Poor management skills and poor team work the only good about the job was the two 30 min breaks
bad,"this job is very difficult, late hours and little to no personal time, the people are cranky making it hard to enjoy work, i do not recommend working the overnight shifts."
bad,"I came into Target as an Electronics Team Member so I don't really know about the other shifts but the few times I worked them they were more freeing. With the exception of cashiers, the sales floor members get to decided on what time to take their break and lunch. I can't say much since I've only worked one or two of those shifts."
bad,Excelente equipo de trabajo y horas al trabajar para tener expericenci del trabajo
bad,If you're willing to stay for years there's opportunity for advancement. Teaches good selling techniques. Great for learning customer service skills.
bad,"*Very Rigorous work"
bad,"Delivery to floor, overnight tasking. Fast paced and attritional on the management level. The most challenging part of the job was making the operation work with an ever changing associate absentee rate."
bad,My overall experience with Target was productive. I've learned quickly and adapted as well . Majority of co-workers were great people as well as the supervisos.
bad,Hard work went unnoticed. Management only cared about themselves. Found better opportunities at Big Y working in Dairy/Frozen food department.
bad,Sold electronics. Spoke with customers and help them by preforming excellent customers service. Stock whole shift if slow/ clean
bad,"They need to work on hiring their reliable, more dependable workers. More organized, more better benefits. They should reward their employees, give raises every 3 months"
bad,"Target is great place to work, only if you work with great management. Recently management changed and has diminished a strong and efficient team we had. The only reason I still work here is because i love working with the people around me. Theirs no benefits, you have to kiss a** to get hours and if you get on managements bad side your pretty much get sucky hours."
bad,"It's a good paying job but not very rewarding. It was very boring and it was the same things everyday, I hated it but it was a decent first job. I wouldn't recommend working there."
bad,.not so bad to work doe minus some managers i liked the people i worked with and waited on.overall it wasnt a bad place to work for  i would go back. Thanks for the few years i was there.
bad,"Target Mobile by Marketsource is only in it for themselves. The commission rate is really low, and the hourly pay is hardly enough for a full time position."
bad,"Management is poor. They talk the talk, but don't walk the walk. They need to set employees up for success. There is not enough equipment or tools to complete the job. So much time is wasted walking around trying to find a supervisor or equipment to function on the job."
bad,"Upper management is maniacally obsessed with opening new Red Card accounts, only criteria used to evaluate employee performance. No regard for real customer service and very little regard for needs of the employees."
bad,"Capitalism at its finest. They do not care about their employees. They just want to make money. Overworked, underpaid, they don't care that you're sick. They don't care that you want to spend time with your family at the holidays. They don't care that a fellow employee hit your car in employee parking and now your car has a big dent in it and they won't let you know who hit you so that you can file a claim with your insurance company, or sue the person who hit you so that you can get your car fixed. They just care about lining their pockets."
bad,"First of all, cart attendant is possibly one of the worst jobs you could get. Leaders On Duty (LOD) are the managers that work there. Most of them treat us like garbage. They see us standing there for one minute and assume we aren't working. Everyday we get screwed with calls for carry outs, spills, bathrooms, and trash. They under staff us daily and give us orders that we aren't responsible for. We work a hard physical job and are not appreciated for it. The most enjoyable part of the job is the other cool cart attendants you get to meet, some you could live without but most are pretty chill."
bad,Management gives unrealistic tasks and expectations. Work life balance is non-existent. They expect you to work every weekend and every holiday. You meet a lot of good people there but management will drive you out of there fast. There is also virtually no way to advance unless you know the right people.
bad,"terrible rude staff that steals merchandise, drug addicts are rampant in the area and they are truly terrible to the woman who go there and need clothing and furniture."
bad,"Favourtism"
bad,INothing really to say at target think they need better management and need to know how to work with there employees the hours are not fair and when we come to them about problems they don't address the issue
bad,I enjoyed cashiering. As a seasonal employee it was very difficult to schedule hours around my full-time job. I was often unable to fulfill the scheduled hours and several times had to address availability with the supervisor.
bad,"I did not like the hours."
bad,"Target UDC 3840 is a corrupt place. They try so hard to make it seem like they care about you but trust me, they DO NOT. I just quit because management sucks, they hire college kids straight out of school as managers because you must have a degree to be one with NO experience and they power trip and think they're God and have no business managing people. Managers don't know jack either, they will tell you one thing and policy is the complete opposite. HR is completely useless, if you have a concern they will blame it all on you and protect management. The pay is great and benefits are decent but it's not worth the BS. The work is pretty easy but Target's management is absolutely terrible. They have extremely unfair policies and most are undefined so they can do whatever THEY want, P.S. they are NOT flexible with scheduling I promise you, they don't care what you need to do, you CAN NOT get a day off unless you have vacation time. Be warned, the great pay and peppy attitudes may make it seem great at first but you'll soon learn the ugly truth about Target. Please don't waste your time and work here."
bad,"I've worked at Target for 3 years, and in the beginning I absolutely loved working there. As time passed however, I noticed that the supervisors or ETL's and TL's had their favorites and that they would get treated 10 times better than everyone else. They would get more hours, and special treatment that infuriated me. Often times I would ask to be cross trained, so that I could pick up shifts when there weren't any available in my department, and constantly got brushed aside. They would tell me that they'd permanently move me when they hired more cashiers, but it just never happened. Cashiers were hired, but I was never moved to another department. Most of the people that get hired end up quitting because they realize that working there is pretty awful. Plus you get paid so little for doing, and putting up with so much."
bad,"Horrible if you want a real security job then go for it, otherwise don't bother with this one. Good thing I switched departments until I can find myself a proper security job with great benefits and something I can actually achieve more knowledge of."
bad,"was a job to get through when money was needed while going to school full time for automotive technology."
bad,"⦁	Cashed people out"
bad,it was ok to work at.  Not the best.  But not the worst.  Break room was chill.  Everything else sucked.  Didn't really work long there so I dont have much to say.
bad,"Due to the location, the customers were snotty and the employees did not make it any better. The employees had nasty attitudes and would cause conflict mostly among themselves, but sometimes with the guest. The managers would take as many breaks as they wanted  leaving their teammates to face things alone at extremely busy time periods . Employees were paid too little to do the jobs they were ""expected"" to carry out, such as leaving the cashier line to clean the out disgusting bathrooms due to the janitors being too inebriated to come into work.Also when managers were upset, they would put lower ranking employees through the ringer and laugh about it later. Do not work there it is terrible."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of lack of communication. Some of the managers are very unprofessional and unfriendly. A lot of people that are promoted are lazy, and don't do there job, whereas those that actually work hard, are not rewarded in any way."
bad,"store management at this Target store were evil selfish people. "
bad,"Always worked alone, hard to get breaks, poor support from management, free samples on Sundays, team trained poorly, hard to get supplies"
bad,"management was not the best, the pay was good, overall the work experience was okay not the best but not the worst. We did get some free lunch but that  was when we were trying our hardest and it was Christmas which was the toughest part of the season"
bad,"stocking shelfs, help costumers on the floor, cover cash register when needed and called, keep shelfs organized and clean I have learned new skills on salesteam the management was poor, the hardest part of the job was collecting all the carts in the parking lot in freezing weather, I enjoy learning sales"
bad,"Every day I would stand at a cash register and ring out customer after customer, attempting to sell them a Target RedCard. Overall, this job was not a negative experience - I liked my coworkers, I didn't mind management, and the only difficult part of the job was doing it for a long shift. Whenever I would open or close I typically just got to hang out with my fellow employees because we wouldn't be very busy."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is straight forword, I deal with returns at guest service mostly all day.  I have learned alot about returns while working at target.  The management at target is not good at all, there is lack of communication amongst employees. I love my co workers, they make the day go by. Hardest part of the job is when you have a out rude guest, but that is part of the job at target.  My most enjoyable part of the job is when I can help a guest find something that they were really hoping to buy or either at my target store or another target store and also opening redcards and hearing my name over the speaker."
bad,"Too much unecessary hard labor due to inexperienced and new facility.  Poor management; not enough equipment; inconsistent freight; inconsistent leadership character among Group Leaders.  Military experience from both workers and managers at potential expense but not genuinely respected for its proper and applicable  flexibility.  Very young facility, lacking potential vision and true management sincerity.  Obviously poor leadership screening for most managerial positions; almost no consideration for boots on the ground input.  Most enjoyable part was shared motivations from hard working peers; hardest part is dealing with ""experienced"" new managers that did not show true interest in relative work environment.  What I learned: current new job (a different company) showed much easier management and emphasis on majority work based off equipment use than manual labor.  Young workers/rising generation of workers: they need communication and rational reasoning and cooperation from managers, not false obviously responses to carry through the day and brush off concerns.  Beware of new leadership competition that ruins systems already in place with shift management."
bad,"A typical day is simply providing fun, fast, and friendly checkout service. I handled money, refunds, and guest exchanges. We had to constantly work on selling REDcards which was very much annoying. Other than that the job was alright."
bad,Very stressful work environment always in your face telling you to push red cards up and down constantly with your hours always having to pick up others work because people are lazy and dont do their job
bad,"The job was busy and hectic. On the bright side, the co-workers were understanding and helpful. The down side... The supervisors would call you in if you did not get enough red card applications and say you are ""in the red"" and they can't keep you on if you are. I worked all kinds of hours on any given day. My half-shifts were frequently extended to full shifts. It took them forever to get to my register when I paged supervisors."
bad,"Overall, there it is not a bad place to work especially if you're young, mobile, and without a family. The schedule there unless you're working days only. Weekend nights is the worst and the senior team rarely accommodates their schedule to fit the weekend schedule. Routine meetings on off-days and a very negative culture when it comes to documenting and advancement."
bad,"Up early to stock shelves. Real early.Great job for high schoolers or college students.Not that great of pay, but it is good 1st job."
bad,"Employees are allowed to harass new employees. Management acted as though they were not aware that a problem existed, when third party had brought it to their attention."
bad,"I learned how to do pricing in a retail store as well as planograms"
bad,I got this job in order to work something other than food and I enjoyed my time there even though they decided not to keep past the holiday season.
bad,The leadership lacked the most basic of abilities.  The people that were praised were the ones that could not complete a task
bad,"Working at Target was decent. I would say it's more for high schoolers or people that are just trying to have a job for a short amount of time. I would not build my life around working at this place, but the people were very friendly."
bad,I enjoyed working for them it was a nice company to work for. All in all they treated their workers with respect and listened to our needs. It was a great experience to learn new and different fields within the comapny
bad,"you work one of 4 shifts and they are either 3 12 hour shifts over the weekends or 4 10 hour shifts during the week.  management is all about numbers how many boxes you move in an hour without taking into consideration, equipment breaking the automated line backing up or the inability to place product due to the back up of pallets. you got 2 20 minutes breaks all day.  it was very numbers focused.  you were never treated as a person but rather as a robot."
bad,"They expect you to be knowledgeable in everything and not pay you more yet, you can run 4 different departments and 2 of them aren't even yours. They say you can advance but when u fill out the app to change spots or go to a higher position they tell you no because they ""need you"" where you're at."
bad,There are too many team leaders and only 1-2 of them actually work. The rest stand around like they can't pitch in. They do start moving though when the big boss comes around. Retail isn't my thing at all but the other employees were nice.
bad,none of the managers are qualified to do their jobs. I worked at the warehouse for 8 years and had over 20 different managers and only about 3 of them were decent people who knew what they were doing. the turn over rate for the managers is higher than the employee turn over per cap. The senior managers could care less about anything other than production numbers. With the attitude that starts from the top it is horrible place to work.
bad,they it was ok  it  was  just a seasonal job they let me go after the season was over  but  it  was   fun working  there it  was very busy   and hard work i was a cashier
bad,While working at Target I have realized how most of the team members are friendly and most ignore or hide from our guests and don't like to help with their job they just hide in the store until it is time for them to leave. The LOD's like to talk about team members behind their backs to other team members and don't cut any slack to newbies. They make all of the new people do all of everyone else's work while everyone else gets to hang out and don't let us leave unless we are close to a meal violation.
bad,very low pay and no overtime nice people to be around. good job to have until you something else. nothing else to say abut that
bad,"I applied for the seasonal sales position, soft lines. This job was supposed to be from November to January. First you have orientation which is just you sitting around doing nothing while someone gets you paperwork to fill out and then some videos to watch. They explain a few things and release you. You get a single schedule with one day of training on it and your trainers name. "
bad,Did not really have too much fun working. Managers were hard on your for communicating on the job. Had a good time with the work and helping people
bad,Worked with good people. Early morning shift was fun and fast-paced. Few hours available. No benefits to employees working less than 40 hours per week. Poor upper level management. Declining store culture.
bad,"Then something happened...management stopped caring about anything but RedCards.  The customers are allowed to walk all over the employees and the company - they rather lose money and make a guest happy, then stand behind their own policies."
bad,"The start-out pay for Target is very good, considering it is a basic retail position. However, the management does not try to make it easy to work there. As a college student, I need more flexible scheduling than Target could provide me. The work is steady and the benefits are okay, though."
bad,"Management was some what stuck up and the workflow was slow, No room for advancement. This company lacks compassion for their employees, I do not recommend a job here."
bad,As a sales floor team member you are required to zone your area. Do your reshop and CAFS for hardlines. If back up is called you are to respond asap so you can go and help guest waiting in line. This can be crazy if you have a lot of stuff to do on the floor and if you are assigned two areas. Which happens a lot.
bad,The company has its pros and cons it about what you are looking to gain from the company. I learned a lot about costumer relationships and how those relationships can make or break a company.
bad,"Target provides jobs for many individuals and sells a wide variety of products. They try to create a team mentality and environment however, their financial compensation for their store workers is barely above minimum wage. Even the best effort results in the bare minimum raise."
bad,i just didn't like is tam handled situation and i feel like they gave favoritism. They didn't pay any attention to other people who were around talking on the phone
bad,Initially it was a good experience than it deteriorated eventually as the management was not friendly. No further opportunities in the field.
bad,"Being on flow team is extremely stressful at times. LOD will constantly be yelling at you even though you are doing your job correctly and quickly. Extreme physical stress. Work starts at 6am to 11am and 4am to 9am constantly have to change sleep schedule. On most work days I average 3-5 hours of sleep. I have asked a couple work friends how much sleep they get, they often say about 2-5 hours or no sleep at all, so I know its not just me."
bad,An Pleasant place to work no room to grow been their almost two years promise the hour will get better  never dose hire an lot of people  bad turn over with employees its a job just to stay active or for  someone in school   if store don't make money  employee hour are cut
bad,"not a good job."
bad,"I worked in the café and as a cashier. There is high turnover and never enough coverage. Starting pay in the café is fair but the amount of work well exceeds the pay. There is no healthcare options because the company makes sure no employee gets 40 hours. Co-workers are cool because we are all in it together. Management is ok, though childish and unprofessional at times with the immature attitudes. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to go home."
bad,"Target is a place that can be fast, fun and friendly but without order, it can be a hard place to work. The work load is heavy and the time you have to complete the job is not enough. Management has their good day. Unfortunately, when the work to do is heavy, the night doesn't end well. Which means whatever is left from the previous night has to be worked on along with the new products coming in to the store. "
bad,Target promises the moon and the stars and that is just not going to happen. Management believes they are higher than any team member and will treat you as such. They will challenge you to do their work and act like it is a gift.
bad,"Started out as a fun place to work.  The people you work with are pretty great as Target strives to hire friendly people.  They talk a lot about being a Team and everyone works together but that just means that if someone doesnt come in, or if hours are cut, you're expected to do their job too."
bad,Interesting company to work for. Have had good and bad management experiences. Overall I've been here almost 6 years so I am fairly happy.
bad,"I was a cashier, maintained a clean working environment, organized gift cards and bags, dealt with different customers mean and nice, had to obtain a goal of a certain amount of red cards"
bad,"Most of the coworkers were super sweet and looked out for each other.... Mainly because management was going to screw you."
bad,"The work you have to do at Target isn't that difficult and you get paid a pretty decent wage for what you do, but the Leaders and Management aren't the greatest. Other employees are usually fine for the most part, it's just once you get into the higher ups. They are willing to make false promises and blatantly lie to achieve their goals. Also, multiple times, I ended up having to deal with more than what I was scheduled for, such as working multiple departments at once, and then having them expecting mine to be flawless when I was ordered by them to waste time watching over another one They also see you as expendable and will cut your hours without a care, even if you're an upstanding employee.  If a problem is brought up with HR, they will offer a very shortsighted, temporary fix and hope you forget about it or drop it. Also, customers, as in all retail, tend to suck."
bad,New management came into the store and there is no quarantee of anyone's position anymore.  There is favortism among other team members and after 11 years of dedication there is no guarantee of a 40 work week with the hiring of a huge staff.
bad,"•	Payment transactions processing - cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
bad,"You need to understand the root of a performance problem before you can fully address it. Ability and motivation go together to impact performance, and the most successful performance improvement efforts combine strategies for improving each. This creates a positive environment where people feel supported to reach their performance potential; and feel valued, knowing that the organization wants to find a good fit for their abilities this company's management does not seem to understand this."
bad,didn't like working there much although the managers had their favorites unfair treating of their employees but I learned a lot about the working environment most people were friendly with me. I loved meeting new people.
bad,"A typical day was repetitive. You would ring up guests, strike up a conversation with them, occasionally sign someone up for a red card, and repeat the cycle over. I learned new ways of how to promote products, such as the redcard. The management was not very flexible and did not use constructive criticism to help their employees. The management used more of a fear technique on their employees and customers. My coworkers were very friendly and great to work with. The hardest part of the job was getting customers to sign up for a redcard. The most enjoyable part of the job was conversing with customers and coworkers."
bad,I would work the registers. If it was slow i would then go organize the front end or i would organize the one spot. In order to advance you have to be friends with management outside of work
bad,as a pharamcy tech you have to do all the work but you get paid less when u work harder than the pharamcist and this place sucks! long line all the time and so frustarting
bad,A job that was quite labor intensive. You had to work multiple departments and didn't get adequate pay for it. The pay is minimum wage unless you were in food department.
bad,"I started at Target as a seasonal employee and actually loved it. I loved the fact that it was fast-paced, I loved the people I worked with, I loved that I got to train in different areas and learn different things."
bad,"Working at Target on the sales floor was the least rewarding job I ever had. Mainly because, it was a low skill job, and the company knew they could replace you with a snap of their fingers. Sales floor on a typical day will help customers with any questions they might have, stock the sales floor, clean, and what ever other duties managers might have. Management was always changing, so it was difficult to gain any type of working relationship. The hardest part of the job was dealing with challenging customers, managers while receiving a low wage. Most enjoyable part of the job was some of the friendships you make while working at the store."
bad,"Stocking items"
bad,"Your coworkers are extremely helpful and kind, but the management will not help you succeed.  Hours constantly changing and never have a real set time frame to guarantee off days."
bad,company is ok. company is very clean and organized. pay is very low and maganment are hard to get a hold of. otherwise company was good
bad,"working in a team environment , friendly , trend , fashion , sales and time management . problem solving . Balance a number of customer in a busy environment ."
bad,just work for target parttime and left because lack of hours nice people to work for just needed more hours and benfits would say its a nice place to work
bad,"Ho lavorato per Target per piu di un anno come Merchandiser. gli aspetti positivi sono il team operativo sempre presente e disponibile. Stipendio puntuale e assunzione con contratto. Il lavoro è autogestibile e questo aiuta ad avere del tempo libero."
bad,I did not like working at target because they don't work with you. They did work around the last bus schedule I explained to them multiple times and they told me if I kept leaving early which my supervisor already said it was fine but my manager said they were going to fire me so I left
bad,"Fast paced environment, go through transactions quick, one thing i liked about target was they rotate their employees to different stations"
bad,"Target's shtick is to hire way too many people and give everyone 15-25 hours. It is almost mandatory to work a second job and Target is very demanding of flexibility. They have a relatively vague attendance policy for show, but the management regularly made indirect statements implying I should work even if I'm sick."
bad,"Unorganized, management team does not follow their own policy, no raises, only gives workers 4hr shifts, no opportunity for overtime, no raises, ineffective ""open door"" policy, overall bad place to work"
bad,i can't wait to find another job this staff here only cares to see you fail they already have a group of employees they like and no matter how hard you work to make it to the top they try their hardest to make you fail.i would recommend anyone to employ here its by far the worst experience I've had
bad,"First thing we unloaded the truck, and sorted out the merchandise with minimal supervision from the management. Then we dragged the merchandise to the floor of the store. Then we placed it on shelves and cleaned the store for opening."
bad,"Working here wasn't an enjoyable job. A lot of people that work here get over worked with only a few hours. Costumers would always come in and complain about things that the workers can't control. The people I worked with, I loved working with."
bad,"Target preaches a fast fun and friendly culture. In order to advance with the company you have to be willing to do some serious brown nosing. I advanced quickly until this miserable woman was transferred to our store as my direct manager. She was lazy, spent most of her time in the office, and was very unethical. I stuck with it for two years while I finished school, but I was soooo done with her and Target by the end of my time there."
bad,Not sure what to say here. Wasn't one of my most up-lifting points in my life. Was a job that I had to do to keep some what as far as keeping the bills half paid.
bad,A typical day at Target will consist of greeting your guest(s) as soon as they approach your line. Always have conversation with your guests and offer them the Target redcard (credit card). I learned how to handle the guests in certain situations. Always take care of your guest the best way possible if your supervisor is not around. Always count the money back to your guest so there is no confusion. The management system was not very understanding of personal matters.The hardest part was trying to convince the guest redcards were a smart decision. The most enjoyable part is seeing your guest leaving satisfied.
bad,"While the company does provide great opportunity for training and development, the culture within the corporate building is just not within normal guidelines. Unless you are willing to come in early and leave later majority of the time, they are not pleased with your work ethic. In addition, the ensure you are working in excess of your full potential, they continuously give you additional tasks until you are stretched so thin that working before/after normal working hours is your only way of getting all of your tasks done. It also is not very minority friendly. While there are some minorities in corporate positions, they are few and far between making it very easy to as if you do not fit in. While not all teams are like this, most of the teams I have encountered have been like this. While I am currently employed there, I am actively seeking employment in a more diverse organization."
bad,start to finish is very demanding. the management is of poor quality. the co-workers do nothing but complain about the job and conditions we work in. the most enjoyment of a shift worked is hitting the time clock at the end of the shift. no advancement. cold in the winter and hot in the summer. dusty and dirty.
bad,fairly easy work with nice staff but little benefits with rarely any perks. A lot is demanded of you with little reward.
bad,Productive and fun for a short period until looking for advancement. Hours can become stressful and management is in a constant state of fluctuation.
bad,"Short, poor training from management, friendly and supportive co-workers."
bad,"High expectations and almost impossible-to-meet standards from upper management.  Very little work life balance- this job becomes your life.  Pay is good, but after a while it is not worth it."
bad,"Always had fun themes during the week for the employees for breaktimes and meals, fun place to work for"
bad,"did not care for tem lead "
bad,I learned how to train new employers and I learned confidence.
bad,"I greeted guests promoted debit and red card, worked on the floor. Worked in food avenue where I was in charge of cooking cleaning serving guests and inventory, as well as stocking the freezers"
bad,"Target is a typical corporate giant that doesn't much care about the little guy. The turnover rate here is high, so they have no quarrels with firing you at the smallest mistake. The pay is competitive for such an unskilled position, but they expect you to work hard for it on their terms. The work is very routine and repetitive, so be ready for lots of the same thing. The management is a little shaky because managers seem to undermine each other. Most people that work here are really lazy and don't much care about their job. The hardest part of the job was getting up at 3:30AM to go to work."
bad,"culture not as friendly as advertised, management uses teammates against one another."
bad,"customer service, cashier, folding tables, help people, team work, fast, fun friendly."
bad,it was just basically stocking and providing customer service.
bad,i did stocking i was trained to work at the customer service desk i worked in women  apparel
bad,My co-workers are great. You never know how many hours they will give you each week.
bad,"Lots of really good people, with lots of different things to do everyday"
bad,"Target Corporate couldn't care less about their employees. They just recently stripped everyone's benefits if you didn't work 40 hours per week, even though they don't let you work 40 hours or you get in trouble. They are also very good at stretching you so thin that it's almost impossible not to hit your breaking point. Once you get really good at meeting their expectations they increase them even though you're already working as hard as you can to meet the last ones. They're impossible to please, the only time you hear from them is when you aren't doing 100% what they ask for and I mean 100%, 99% isn't good enough. They keep increasing their goals for you yet somehow you don't get compensated any more for doing twice the work you were doing. They also like to implement new ""tools"" that are supposed to make things easier for you but end up making things take 10x longer than they used too."
bad,"Target overall is a great place to shop and has a good model for their employees to follow being a part of the Target ""culture.""  But, I had a very hard time with the way things were run at the particular Target I was at.  The managers never seemed to be available for guests when I would call them to my register for help; there were many times that there were never enough cashiers to help during the day; prices were always questioned by guests and I couldn't help them with many of their concerns because it was in my area of working or jurisdiction to do so, and the list goes on.  Most of the fellow associates I was with were great, but the managers had weird attitudes and weird authority complexes that seemed a bit out of control to me personally.  "
bad,"I worked at Target from the beginning, a month prior to opening and a year and a bit after. I had no security, no reliable hours, and my singular raise occurred because minimum wage was bumped. Overall an awful experience, I would not work there again."
bad,"Target and I Have a love hate relationship but I would not wish it upon anyone. Work is a constant day of politics; those who know how to play the game survive or thrive. "
bad,Inventory of whole store everyday with hand held computer (PDA) Management very much out for there self's. Amazing co-workers. Scheduling was random. Miss my co-workers not the job nor Management.
bad,"The Target store where I previously worked was small compared to the other Target stores in the area. While the store was relatively small for a Target, it was very much understaffed, and it broadened my job descriptions from doing one job to various others, while getting paid $8.75/hr (the minimum wage at the time). Friendly environment, but pretty harsh work conditions."
bad,"a typical day at work was okay, nice people who are there to mind there own business and work."
bad,"They are not the company they say, good pay but that's about it, they constantly drive you physically everyday, they let you know that they are the only company that's going to pay you as much as they do, they say they care but really don't. 75% of Management does not care about people they only care about numbers and their bonus, and they come in with no management experience."
bad,"While Target does a lot of good in the eyes of the public, after working in the trenches at two different locations for almost six years and the overnight shift at both locations and working with two different teams I can honestly say that both store had their positives and negatives with the negatives winning out. Day side team members didn't work half as hard as an overnight person. The people I worked with had their cliques and negative remarks about coworkers and management behind their backs. In store work, we would fall behind at the end of every shift and until recently dayside finally would put some of our left over merchandise from the previous nights workaway. Almost every night we get a truck full of merchandise to put away onto the sales floor or back room. By the time it was time to leave for the day we would have pallets, and pallets, and pallets, thousands and thousands of merchandise that would just sit there until we would come back that night and by the time we would go home the next day, we would be even more behind. No sense of accomplishment whatsoever. I would completely dread having to come into work every night. Despite missing 0 days of work from the time I started at my new store and being late twice from oversleeping and twice because of legit car problems until my 1st review the company decided my raise would be an extra .28 an hour. In this economy while the company I work for goes on about giving tens of millions of dollars to the local community's, I'm living lean as it is and an extra $11.20 a week if I do work 40 hours on the button isn't going"
bad,dont really have good things. cant work enough hours. even with experience they wont give you a raise.
bad,"The day would start with a meeting, then we'd stock shelves.  One quickly learned how to manage time and move quickly.  Most of the co-workers were young or retired.  This was part-time for everyone.  The most difficult part of the job was being part-time.  However, the co-workers and I got along well."
bad,"Easy job. Typical sales associate job. Helped people, stocked shelves."
bad,"At target I was responisble for soft lines, which was working on the sales floor with the clothes, I was to help the guest around the store and make thier shopping experience at target better, i also did back up cashiering when needed at the front and the food court too."
bad,Nice job for the first time job looker.  Nice way to get out and meet people in the community
bad,"I worked for Target for 8 years. I started as a cashier, was promoted to softlines specialist, then after the company took away specialist positions, I moved to the presentation department.  I was fully trained for cashier, guest service, sales floor, backroom, price change, and presentation - I could work anywhere in the store except the café, and pharmacy.  Even with all of my training, I could not be promoted to any team lead, or other management position, because I did not have a B A Degree or better, and was not currently going to school to get one.  The pay is horrible, they offer great benefits, but you can't afford them.  I would recommend this job for a high school student that's looking for basic work experience, but if you have any real financial obligations, this is not the job for you."
bad,"This is a retail company and everything that you can expect with that is true. Low pay, few hours, no advancement opportunities."
bad,"not willing to work with school schedule and work"
bad,"Low pay, with high expectations.  Management should take personal communication classes."
bad,"At target working the graveyard shift as a stocker took a lot of energy. This was overall fun and exciting but never would make a career out of it. I learned how to stock, take inventory and how to pull pallets. The hardest part was keeping up the endurance to work graveyard and keep the strength to lift boxes up a ladder and pull pallets. The most enjoyable part is the fast paced environment and the employees who strive to keep it up beat for us all."
bad,The work start by unloading a truck and getting product to the floor .The hardest part of the job is fast paced work .The short work schedule and short hours make this job better as a second job.
bad,"at first target was the best retail store to work and then about 6 month ago everything just started going bad, cutting hours, keep hiring a new people and not given an opportunity for elder team members to work more then schedule."
bad,"after working for several weeks and told several times that i was a great employee by one manager i was constantly told i was ""not working hard enough""  by the manager that seemed to have employees that she treated differently. this caused a hostile working environment for me and forced me to resign my position"
bad,Clean work environment with helpful employees and management.
bad,Nice 15% discount on all merchandise for all employees. Its a nice company for those who need just an extra bit of income.
bad,"Would get into work at 2am unload trailers pull pallets onto floors, open boxes with co-workers. Do pets and auto."
bad,"diverse work environment"
bad,"A typical day is a tiring one as it drags along. Throughout the years of working here, I must say I have learned a lot about dealing with people and have grown as a person. My communication skills have excelled since working at Target. The hardest part of the job I would say is the pay since is is more or less minimum wage. The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture and ability to talk to others such as guests and team members."
bad,"I applied for the overnight shift because I wanted to make extra money- since overnight is usually $9.00/hr instead of $8/hr . However after a couple of months they cut my hours so I was only making the regular $8.00/hr. Since there was no real point to be working late shift without the pay benefits of that time frame, I asked to be moved to a morning shift instead- which i at the time knew they were hiring for anyway, they refused."
bad,"Working at Target was not too bad as retail work goes, but the management at my store was fairly disorganized and had a lot of trouble maintaining a consistent culture. This was largely due to frequency of management changes and reassignment at the store and district levels."
bad,"Long hours shifts, 12 hour 3 days a week and 4 ten hour shifts. If you don't mind being on your feet for hours on end with breaks spread out this is an ok job. Most positions are seasonal and temporary. You must clear multiple forms of security to enter though."
bad,This job is designed for young people. Lot of late nights. The management is not very friendly.
bad,"daily cash and credit transaction ,customer service stock and shipment food and bev prep"
bad,even though i was hired while still in school it was a nice job to work for and the managers where helpful during training
bad,Hard company to move forward with. The managers are somewhat difficult to work with
bad,"Worked at Target HQ for 10 years. Target used to be a great place to work, but not anymore:"
bad,"Overall, Target was a great place to work my first two and a half years! In your best interest, record all ""coachings"" & conversations on digital audio."
bad,Poor management means poor development. Staff was very immature and the supervisor knew nothing about productivity and spent his time criticizing team mates.
bad,This company takes their employees for granted. They pay is not good. Management is not professional.
bad,"I worked night typically, most of my management staff were pushy when it came to attachment sales, which appeared to be the only thing they cared about... Consistent with a mind set of caring less about the customer experience and more about meeting regional quotas. Management wasn't bad, though a few team leaders and and executive team leaders that left a lot to be desired of a boss. Overall our ""guests"" we're okay, from time to time you get a real problem, but that's just what happens in retail and service industries. Most of my coworkers were great, a few we're lazy or neglectful, but most worked hard for terrible treatment and sub-standard pay. Only part I ever enjoyed was getting people a product that they came back and thanked me for."
bad,5 years ago was a great place to work.Since has gotten to be a place where team members pay for the mistakes or overspending of corporate. They have implemented programs with little to no value to what we do daily. Every year they have team surveys that says our opinion counts. That couldn't be further from the truth.. Our opinions count for Nothing
bad,Getting the aisles ready for set up. getting to see all the new stuff before it was put out for customers to buy.
bad,"Target can be a fun place to work, I have learned a lot from the different areas I have worked in the store. My favorite was price change and comparison shopper. I have learned to deal with all sorts of personalities. Learning something new everyday is a great way to improve yourself and in these positions I did."
bad,"I only worked for Target for about 3 months. I was hired right after Thanksgiving. I learned that Target is the last company I would ever want to work for again. They ignored my work experience and paid me low wages, but because I was laid off and it was the first job offer I got, I took it until I found something better. Some of my coworkers were fun to work with, but management was a headache. The hardest part of the job was having to promote the Target store card. It was an unrealistic expectation that only benefited upper management."
bad,The work place was fast-paced and enjoyable. The managers were really nice and compassionate.
bad,"time fly's when working in the back "
bad,"Target was a great start off job, you learn alot of different skills. They did expect me to do the job of a team lead while still being paid at a lower salary. Co-workers were great. Work enviroment was hazardous at times."
bad,"Guest service. Lead team to keep store brand. Work out merchandise from the stockroom or truck. "
bad,A typical day at work was long and often times exhausting... Co-Workers were easy to get along with for the most part. Management was often heard but not seen.. The hardest part of the job for me was the many hours I worked that kept me away from my family
bad,"The work itself is not hard, just tedious. But it gets hard when you have team leads and managers rushing you and calling you from one area to another to do something simple that they can do themselves. For the most part I enjoy the hours and physical demands of the job, but I have little to no respect for the people who are over us that simply don't do anything but stand around and watch us work. Not sure if it's just my particular store, but I've heard of similar behavior from other stores as well."
bad,"A typical work day is very busy in retail. "
bad,i really didn't like working at target because management let the employees with seniority order other employees around.
bad,"The people that you will be working with really do feel like family, however management needs to improve."
bad,"It's retail.  It's what you expect.  Poor pay, good co-workers, mostly bad bosses, there are a few good ones that actually care about everyone, non-existent benefits, can only move up if you're extremely overqualified or suck up a lot."
bad,"on a typical morning opened as team leader, guest service associate, and cashier"
bad,"Working overnight has it own draw backs which are never really unexpected but when pay is so low you cant pay bills it is a hard job to have,"
bad,"Being honest, the job itself isn't difficult at all. Working on the flow team was once a pleasant experience. But when it comes to compensation, things become depressing. The flow team is not for people who have families or intend to use the positions as a sole income source. Its a stepping stone until a better opportunity presents itself; or for teenagers or college students with no major life responsibilities."
bad,easy work place moves fast & you have a deadline for every assignment
bad,"This job was very boring, management stunk"
bad,"-Didn't really get along with co-workers"
bad,"A typical day at work is tiresome and stressful but i always complete work. I learned how to read labels to stock sales floor as well as backroom. The management is not good at all. They don't get work did fairly and correctly, they ask your opinion to make things better but they don't use it, they wait for the day of or before a visit to try to clean and do everything and they let people leave when they want before completing it expecting others to do it. My co-workers are fun to work with some are lazy and don't care about leaving thier work but others do. the hardest part of the job is doing my job and then going to complete others job and the most enjoyable part is working my area ."
bad,"hard work hard labor, little or no pay, short breaks, no hours"
bad,"The idea of having a cellphone kiosk in Target isn't a bad idea, but there are a few things they need to work on at least in my district to make it work."
bad,"they have 85 employees in your dept but spread it out to about 15 hours per week per person, makes for a lovely paycheck"
bad,"Although Target seems like a fun, fast-paced, friendly workplace, it is unorganized and confusing. A typical day at work involves about five to ten different tasks being given to you by so many different managers, it is difficult to keep up. Management is pretty bad. There are too many managers setting responsibilities. Even now, I don't know who is my direct manager. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing customers leave satisfied, especially after helping them myself."
bad,It was an ok place to work. They do a lot of good charity work in the community.
bad,"I was the receptionist I would answer calls, deliver mail, interview potential employees etc..... My coworkers were very disrespectful and barely worked.  The hardest part was be able to do my work because most of my coworkers were always up front bothering me.  I enjoyed learning some skills on the job that I did not know before I starting working there."
bad,"Compensation is very low for the work expected, especially now that they raised the quota for how many customers you get to sign up for a red card. "
bad,"A typical day at work would be managing a team of 5 or less at time because the shift manager made an error with the schedule for the day. Doing the best of my ability to accomplish in clearing the system and accomplishing to do some backstocking. When everyone was there it was much easier to clean up the system and the floor. Because I would be able to separate the groups into two: the first group would in charge to clear the system from any request and then go back to continue backstocking the merchandise in their right groups. The other would just be backstocking and clearing the pallets. It would also included clearing the trash, securing the doors, truck(s), cleaning up the bathrooms, and office. Also entering forms to fixed any clocking errors for my coworkers. Coaching team members that were not following the company culture or having persistent absents/tardiness. We all did our best get along and have fun with our work. Also we all try to be fair to each other and listen to their concerns. As well tried to be a counselor in there time of need. One of the most difficult time was the managers fighting among each other and then trying to get the rest of team leaders and team members involved in their situation. "
bad,There wasn't ever really a typical day at work as the needs of our guests changed everyday.
bad,This job is a good job if your in school and looking for something part time. If your like me single parent than this is the worse job for. The pay sucks and the hour suck too. I don't feel like an equal here. I don't make enough money to pay bills and live on my own. One week you could have 35 hours and the next have on 15 hours. 
bad,cashering money handling ive learned how to assist customer my co-worker were pretty helpful
bad,I was responsible for recovering the sales floor and back-up cashiering
bad,A typical day would begin by clocking in and going to my assigned area to unload the delivery truck. after unloading the delivery truck I am responsible for stocking product to assigned areas.
bad,"Maintained stockrooms, unloaed the truck and got merchandise to floor, learned alot about Jewelry."
bad,"This was an extremely physical job, that required well developed interpersonal skills."
bad,customer service is hard work with everything i deal with but also rewarding. the management is horrible. like co-workers. like being around people. pay is horrible. feel like i work with a ten year old store manager
bad,"fun place , great customer service, fast paced. great experience"
bad,"Weekdays are easy and weekends are very busy and they understaff the store if sales goals are not being met.  A lot of my co-workers are friends of mine and that helps a lot.  Management is hit or miss, some are really nice and some are just cold."
bad,"Company is more concerned with profit than customer service.   Employee hours are determined based on store sales compared with projected sales.  If the store brings in less money than expected, your hours will be reduced in future schedules.  Cashiers are primarily judged on productivity and credit card sales."
bad,"stressful , expectations are too high. Sometimes belittling."
bad,Over the years I have seen countless hard workers pushed onto the back burner instead of being promoted. The hours are constantly being cut back and the pay is not a proper compensation for the work expected of you.
bad,Target Corporation has no Full time positions They are barely even even have enough hours to be part time how is someone supposed to live off of 9 hours a week
bad,"Answer the phone. Most of the time it consists of guests asking for a refill on a medication, or a refill on medications that have refills. Taking in prescription, make sure we have the drug, give a wait time. Type the prescription up with correct medication, quantity, directions, refills and correct doctor. Fill the medication. assist the pharmacist in anything they need. Be a team with my co-workers and help in any way I can when they need it. I love helping people. Especially when they cant afford a medication I take the initiative to either call the doctor to change to a cheaper medication or provide a valid discount to help them."
bad,Retail is a tough place to work for an extended period of time.
bad,Management sucks. They use the handbook to their avantage and not consistant with all team members
bad,"An okay place to work but daily workload and goals are typically lofty and unrealistic. Inconsistent scheduled hours and little chance for advancement cause a steady turnover. Flexible shifts for students or part time employees, but not a good place for someone with a family and normal amount of bills to pay."
bad,work late hours
bad,"The job itself isn't bad, But the LOD's are very condescending towards lower level workers. They're unrealistic with what's to be done and do not work as a proper functioning team should."
bad,"* I doing my work so fast and producible, because the time clock is running,Have to many years experience in this job, I start and finish at time."
bad,"I cant say enough about how one store manager can ruin your life, your career and your dreams. Target recruited me out of college and I came in as an intern and just loved everything about the company. I was a high potential marked by the DM and was moving up fast, all until I got put in a very bad crisis store that I was there to fix EVERYTHING it seemed. I had to work with a co manager to fix her messes which was not normal. I ended up working 90-110 hours a week because my store manager never thought anything I did was good enough, I would be schedule a 10 hour shift to be the manager on duty and then I would have spend another 10 hours in all my departments. There is no work life balance and being a 21 single person I have no idea how people with families or a spouse survived. Target offers you a lot but they want a lot in return so be ready to earn every bit of that amazing salary."
bad,I opened the store and also all the cash registers. Was in charge of all front store plan o grams and all cashiers breaks. I also worked the guest service desk for all returns and exchanges. my title was gstl guest service team lead.
bad,i learned quite a bit about different things while working here. gave me good knowledge of things.
bad,"I started working at Target in October of last year and it was okay. I work as a cashier/ cart attendant/ guest services on occasion. The things i like from the job is the pay is actually not that bad. When you get the hours you want, everything is just splendid. I work hard when I'm there so my hours are fine, It's just the people i work with that makes the job unbearable. Rude cashiers, sometimes rude LODs and just a very hostile environment. I mean i understand that it's just retail but come on people, it's not that hard to be nice. They also yell at you if you don't get enough Redcards. It is not MY fault no one wants YOUR stupid cards. It also sucks when it's a slow day because the cashiers just stand there not being able to do anything. I also hate the guests but that's a given. I would rather be a night stocker or backroom but they tell me I'm too reliable for the front end and won't let me cross train into anything else."
bad,very quick to cut someone down. shady treatment of employees
bad,I get along with co-worker's we work as a team to accomplish stores ratings and I enjoy helping guest in getting what they need.
bad,The work was often fast pace and did not pay well . Maybe a good starter for teenagers .
bad,"no complaints, i dont really have anything to say about target other then i love shopping there but not so much working there"
bad,I can work with anyone. I do alot of the inventory. and assisitng the pharmicist with any problems that might occur.
bad,Work with Target on the early morning or overnight crew is always the same. Higher management either never or rarely sees or interacts with you and your own managers will often either not provide you with training or leave all of your training to another team member who wasn't trained properly to begin with.
bad,. Management needs to be more global and not just focussed on there own needs.
bad,My experienced at target was fair.i did my job the best everytime i came to work.only thing i enjoy was free food. management was tough on me
bad,"Work hard for no advancements. In order to get one, you have to be a manager's favorite. Learned how to push carts which is very easy. Managment does not know how to properly run the store. Makes sure they have their bonuses instead of fix things that need to be fixed such as broken checkstands. Co-Workers were great and made the enviroment better since your days there are boring and dull without them. Hardest part like I said was working hard for them to tell you to do better even if you did the job perfect. Most enjoyable part was clocking out for the day."
bad,"From the start of shift you are expected to work and you are held accountable for your productivity while on breaks and at meetings. For a person to be promoted you would have to kiss everyones in managements backside, all to notice they hired someone straight out of college for the management position. The building is always super hot until someone from the corporate office comes to visit and that is when all of the fans and vents are open to cool the building down. The one thing that I found out is that they run every DC differently but making it everyday at one of the worst, is not easy."
bad,"This was my first job. As a cashier it was ok except that we were always short staff. The hours weren't as great because i closed every day even though i had told them that i couldn't stay that late. Worked about 40 hours a week, management isn't that great as well, not flexible at all with my schedule and the pay could had been a little better."
bad,managers were rude and treated employees with disrespect
bad,"I was a sales floor team member at Target for two years. The job is quite easy to learn: all we do is place merchandise from stockroom, replace returned merchandise, and make sure merchandise is where it is supposed to be. We also must double as cashiers when lines become too long."
bad,Handle responsibilities of greeting and identifying the requirements of customers
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job with Target ( I worked in the food court) was getting to know the customers and having them return and want to be in the food court when I was on shift. I had my loyal customer base and fellow employees who made the job a lot more enjoyable. The job was fairly easy, just had to remember policies about food storage and handling."
bad,did not enjoy it co-workers gossip a lot
bad,"Worked as a flow coordinator they rush you to unload trucks, once unloaded they bring skids of merchandise out & in the grocery area we are literally throwing items down the isles they belong in until the skid is empty, then you proceed to put the items away until the next skid comes out then you do it again. More things get broken then you could imagine. Target is wasteful as they come throwing items out because of a damaged box rather then selling at a discount to workers or donating the item to a local rescue mission. $150 desk trashed because the box was torn??? Yup a daily event, ever wonder why things are in the wrong places constantly, you are rushed and if you come across items wrong you are told ""we'll get to it later"" which they never do.....Just sloppy work maybe because they don't pay well & all the workers are PT and just don't care. It's almost impossible to get in fulltime & the ones there seem to just be passing the time"
bad,"Store opens and the guest come in to shop and return items, team members are keeping the counters clean and helping the guest. Team members go and help when called into different areas."
bad,"This job was very demanding for flexibility. I was part of Soft Lines which is the sales floor. My job was to fold and straighten everything in the men's and baby department. Facing shelves and stocking merchandise. Excellent customer service, and registrar service. I enjoyed the customers, and being able to help them find what they needed!"
bad,No benefits offered unless you are in management.
bad,I worked at T1544 since 2004 store opening to 2011. I gave a lot to that company only to see that they do not value employees that are dedicated to insure its success. I have seen great employess treated unfairly. In exampel. I witnessed a manger tell an employee that he would rather fire them instead of working with them to solve a schedule issue. Thats not professional to me and I feel that personal feelings of that nature should never reflect in the work place. Everyone should get a fair shake. Other then that the bennifits and hours are good. But they need more development in there management field.
bad,We get our schedule 2 weeks in advance which is a nice thing because our hours are all over the place. One day you work 8 to 1 and the next might be 545 to 10 and the next might be a 7 hour day.
bad,"I did not like target as much as my other positions because of how the management treated their employees, it always seemed as though they did not care about their employees, only about their customers. I noticed that management would give new hires more hrs than employees with tenure, no matter how well a person performed in their department."
bad,very friendly and goal oriented environment. Big on team work. It is part-time with no guarantee on a minimum amount of hours in a week. One week you work 30hrs and the next week only 5hrs scheduled because of payroll issues.
bad,"Though Target is labeled as a high rated, community based cooperation it does lack what it is perceived to be. The management ladder is good as far as people skills, but in the way the store is operated I find it a complete mess. Upper management clash in their objectives with major departments such as Appliances, Toys and Electronics, and Grocery departments."
bad,Tired
bad,Everybody worked with each other and they helped you on whatever you need help with.
bad,I sucks and you cant really move up in the industry. They value the ppl which is fine and they have your back when it comes to customer complaints but at the end of the day its a a constant battle with them
bad,"Managers treated me differently because I was a student, workers were given different levels of responsibility without adequate compensation for hard work"
bad,"Poor management, revolving door of STL, ETL, and team leaders."
bad,"You’re easily replaceable, never forget it. Not a joke, if you are ever made to feel like something with this company, it’s just to get an extra 5-10 boxes an hour out of you. Production is the pure goal of your managers. Every smile you get from them is not symbolic of your growth as a person and a worker, but as growth of their yearly bonus."
bad,"Being a fulfillment specialist at Target was more stressful than anticipated. It helped my communication skills but was too competitive and I lost hours quickly. The culture at the Dublin Target is friendly, but it is difficult to find help when you get stuck."
bad,"Im not saying all targets are bad but i worked seasonal at Montclair CA Location t1423 and it was nightmare. They are not organized in the backroom. is a disaster back there. I worked the SFS department and also GM, when i was working SFS most of the time i could never find the items i needed to grab and my Supervisor would just tell me to keep searching to the point where i'd run out of time on my order. My co workers in my department weren't the nicest people but i could understand that they themselves were stressed out. My ETL and the store manager were the nicest people you could ever meet. I did enjoy working at target but i'd probably never again work at t1423."
bad,"The company, from my perspective, is really great for consumers but not great for staff. With big box retail, there is very little work/life balance, all of the responsibility but very little control over the outcome. The culture is lacking and morale was very poor."
bad,I did not feel I was being short changed in my job as I did what I needed to meet my daily goals. Management was sort of on the very biased side by preferring to work with the young women at my store much more often and gave them more hours despite their ability to do their job well.
bad,"Not organized, not a fun place there always so busy so every time you try and organize it just gets ruined, hard to talk with management if you have any concerns"
bad,"The pay is well enough to live on from paycheck to paycheck. Yet management is not good about communicating amongst themselves or the teammates. There is some good leadership that encourages good work, but most leadership seems to treat teammates as objects instead of people."
bad,"I worked in the Starbucks, and Target management didn't really care about us, just the Target employees. We would find ourselves out of stock of various products needed to make drinks and would have to tell customers that we were unable to make many drinks due to a shipment not being ordered on time. I am a full time student, and was drawn in by talk of being flexible and understanding of student schedules. I was proven wrong on my FIRST DAY being officially hired when my proof of eligibility to work wasn't put in my file and my schedule was put into the system incorrectly. I tried to talk to management multiple times to get it fixed and submitted 3 separate schedule change requests, which were ignored and auto-denied because of this (why I ended up leaving after only 2 months working there). I found out during one of these attempts that I was set to be terminated because of my information proving I'm eligible to work wasn't on file and I wasn't told about it other than ""We absolutely need it before *certain date* so you'll have to find a way to bring it in"" (difficult to do because I live on campus and what I needed was at my actual home). Other than those issues, I loved my coworkers and had fun making drinks and interacting with customers. It's definitely a fast paced job! I initially worked with 2 other people but after my two week ""training"" period I was quickly led to work on my own despite not having been taught all of drinks and duties expected of working alone. You get these super thick flip books in store to reference for drinks, but you can't really do that if you're"
bad,"I was only Seasonal there but from my short time there I learned a lot. First off, training is fairly easy, just a lot of information to remember. Lockers were first come first serve as well as putting food in the refrigerator. Super long hours, especially if you only worked part-time. No one picked up the phone (especially HR) if you had an emergency. Team leaders were almost always never around when needed help at registers, also sometimes bad attitudes. Some team members were very judgmental. Their meal policies were just ridiculous and almost always disorganized. Even if you follow instructions by managers, you always get called out for something you never knew about. Overall, it was okay for the time being but would not return."
bad,When I started they working I said a learning great things after a month that's when things  Started to change  His attitude I  think he just didnt like me 2 more months I got fired With no explanation
bad,"I had a pretty rough experience as a Seasonal Fulfillment Expert, mainly due to the incompetence of my Team Leader. She had an abrasive attitude, didn't put in much effort to train me, and stopped scheduling me 3 weeks before I was told the season would end. There is a policy in place for notifying seasonal employees of the end of their employment and she did not follow it. I found encouragement from other team members and Leaders, but she made me feel unwanted"
bad,"This job was probably my least favorite place I ever worked at. I always felt alone at work. There were people I talked to,but I was never truly happy working here because the overall environment was depressing. I felt like the bosses didn't care if you came or went, they didn't tell you what you needed to know and I ended up learning important information for other coworkers, and they were just plain emotionless when you talked to them."
bad,"Target is not a good place if you’re looking for a full time job to move up and succeed at. Management was blindly picked and it shows, unfortunately. Benefit was only in compensation"
bad,"this was very easy job, i was hired to work seasonal with potential to remain full time. after the first month i knew despite being offered the full time position i would not be staying simply because of the catty atmosphere presented by the management team."
bad,"All team members / co-workers are great and super friendly people who would all agree that since the big changes happen in 2018, it's been all downhill due to unrealistic deadlines and expectations."
bad,I was very unhappy there when I worked there. Management was very clique and I felt secluded but im overly sensitive. I left because I was unhappy working there and felt that i could find something better.
bad,"It was unlike any place I've ever worked, and probably unlike any place I'll ever work again. It started off as a really fun, innovative place to work. They had neat events that made work fun and catered to employees while upping morale so all your team mates were a lot of fun to be around and work with. "
bad,"Target used to be a good place to work, had teamwork and people used to care about their work. The last couple of years its felt overwhelmingly negative from management down. Still some good people that work there but a lot of them just don't seem to know or care about there jobs anymore. The people who did care had to much put on them and the stress started to sky rocket. The working conditions at the one I worked at were awful down right unsafe at times. Fun and Friendly it isn't."
bad,"Nice job, it was ok very fast paced a lot of people working with you. Nice lunchroom area, very relaxing at times .. lunch breaks are short . Pizza in lunchroom"
bad,"New reorganization puts too much workload on the Team Members and not enough time to get it done. Management was constantly contradicting itself in its quest to compete with  Amazon. Target has lost its identity, Is it a Discount store, a boutique, an online destination?"
bad,"Great for part time work, but if you're looking for a fulltime job/career look elsewhere. Management expects high turnover and over hire. Every morning they ask half the staff to go home. 3/4 through the day they ask the rest of the staff to go home."
bad,"The place is horrible to work at, but you end up staying past your limits because of the co workers whom you bond with in your misery. Everyone was unhappy and complaining daily about management and the lack of truthfulness. Especially if you're in a high traffic position like guest services, you will be bombarded by rude, demanding, entitled guests who push you to the brink of wanting to walk off the floor and no one in management will have your back, everything was always our fault"
bad,"If this is not going to be your first job, I wouldn't bother. The lies that you hear on the daily basis from management about advancement and opportunity make the day a lot longer.  Get your experience & go. It's not enough to make a living for the amount of hours that you work and the most you can expect to get in return is an index card with a star."
bad,They cut your hrs and change stuff and dont teach you info in shift you got. Csnt get really extra hrs in less your back up cashier or cart pusher. My hrs went 3 to 4 days to one or two days a week  both weekly pay. Took month just get prove I didn't work there
bad,"Target is great if you are looking for some extra cash during the holidays. Other than that, they tend to mass hire and dont typically give out more than 20 hours a week."
bad,"Working for Target as an hourly employee was great. The work was not difficult. The more promotions you receive, the more responsibility. Work/life balance is not great."
bad,"Target is, and always has been, a godsend for people looking for their first jobs. While the work is fast-paced, it teaches you valuable skills that can be applied to any number of employment opportunities"
bad,Working at target has its ups and downs . They have great benefits when I had my baby early i was able to go right into maternity leave I was at home comfortably . But management is at an all time low
bad,"If you need the money, go for it. If you intend to stay past Christmas, you'll be more stressed than you were during the holidays. You may find some great people who you work with, but management will try to end that if they see you having fun!"
bad,Managers pick and choose who they want to harass and make follow certain rules. Everyday is a different unnecessary change in daily tasks. When you have kids or other things outside of Target they give you a hard time and cut your hours if you have to take off for whatever reason.
bad,"While I enjoyed working at Target, I did not enjoy being unknowingly fired while on vacation. I had briefly mentioned to management that once school was back in session I’d be going full time. I was told they’d talk about it and get back to me. In short they never got back to me and when my name did not appear on the schedule 3 weeks out I had to ask why. They played dumb as if they hadn’t known that I wasn’t told of my letting go. If you work here you better be free all the time..."
bad,"Target team members perform a variety of job duties throughout department store locations. Typical work days include greeting customers, stocking shelves, organizing displays, taking inventory, and assisting in sales. Many crew members with Target serve as cashiers, as well."
bad,Bad place unless you have no life or kid great for high school or younger people that just need a few extra dollars ....:.:.:...::::::...................
bad,I don't like the changes. I'm here 8 years and now making the same hourly rate has someone that just started. The older associates work harder/do more then those just coming in which is nothing.
bad,I was a cashier and typically would help out with carts and reshop. Individually I hate busy work so standing at a register was tough but their breaks were adequate and made the work day go quicker. The hardest part of the job was staying motivated to doing the busy work I hated and I enjoyed the other employees.
bad,"I was very excited to begin my new job at target but about a month or two in I began to realize this was not what I wanted. Management gossips with staff, they cut hours when you do not kiss up to them, unrealistic expectations."
bad,It’s a decent place to work. It pays the bills. The guest and their happiness is the ONLY thing that matters. If they’re satisfied then you will be fine.
bad,"As is the business with all jobs, bad management can ruin any good job. Hopefully you end up with a Lead that you get along with. Because if you don't, then they can find any number of reasons to write you up and put you through the wringer until you're constantly worried about getting fired over any little thing. People are rough. But, with a good Lead, it's a good paying job that isn't too hard."
bad,"Every shift was another problem with a new customer (oh excuse me, GUEST.) took me three weeks to get through orientation because they had my phone number written down incorrectly. I even showed up to be told orientation was cancelled. There’s a lot to learn in a very short time span. Very little guidance. My schedule was terrible. I had a gap of ten days without  shift for crying out loud. They like to tell you cross training wiill get you more hours, but good luck getting trained in another department. Wouldn’t recommend. Can’t stand all the entitled people thinking I can give them whatever they want. Left that job after getting a way better one, and the store manager screamed at me over the phone. Fun times."
bad,The management at this store was poor. They barely got us our breaks and lunches on time. Poor form. One of the supervisors was very petty but the other four were pleasant to work with.
bad,It was ok but it could really need some improvements like communication and actually teamwork. But lucky I had some experience in retail and knew what I was doing.
bad,I have been at target for about 3 years now.  The only constant I have noticed is that changes are coming.  They change something that is working just to change it back.
bad,"Target is a great place to work, if you have absolutely no family or anything you like to do outside of work. The worst work/life balance I have ever seen. Was almost forced to call out for my dying grandpa's 80th birthday because they wouldn't let me have the day off. "
bad,"Too many changes within the last year, not for the better. Hiring managers from the outside instead of within the company. Work life balance sucks, most employees are scheduled mid day shifts, not allowing you to spend time with your family or children."
bad,"Specific leaders at my store are disrespectful, rude and unsafe to work around. Because of these things I am looking for a more positive place to grow."
bad,"Employees and customers were great and the job itself (checking out guests) was good. Raises on front are mainly dependant on your ability to sell their red cards, if you can do that you will be fine."
bad,The hardest part of working at target is the expectations they have.. They go way to overboard expecting the unexpected an it makes working for them treacherous
bad,it was a stable job while in in college then i had to leave because i was also a college football player at time so i didnt have a choice but i enjoyed my time there
bad,"Benefits were pretty decent. Had stock, 401k, health, etc. Discount was 10%, with bonuses on buying healthy food/certain brands. Decent vacation accrual. Corporate, however, made the decision to protect salary managers over hourly team members, and if a conflict arose between both, the company would find a way to fire the hourly. (Confirmed by an inside source.) Management would regularly pick favorites and if they felt threatened by a team member, would harass them until they left. Team members staffing went from fair to impossible. Shelves are left bare because all the stock is in the back, because they chose to staff for the bare minimum and expect all workers to do the job of 3-4 good team members. Disabled team members were driven out of the company because they could not keep pace."
bad,"I started part time , was promoted offered full time and all that goes with that  . When I got to my new store I was not given any of the things that had been promised . I got few hours and was quite disappointed."
bad,Decent place but no job security. Management at certain locations lack empathy. They increased our hourly salary but cut employees hours. It is unrealistic to expect employees to do 8 hours of work load In a 4 hour shift.
bad,"Scheduling manager hates everybody, puts them on worst shifts possible. You get in trouble for going over 40 hours, even if they ask you to do so. Super boring work and customers were sometimes incredibly rude."
bad,Just no. not for me. Maybe it was just the location. Other departments would tell us how to do our job when they weren't doing theirs right and making everyones job in my department harder than it is.
bad,In the beginning it was fine. I thought it was a typical customer service job. Over the years management changed. With all those management changes. So did the store changes. We’re asked to do the jobs of 3 people. For little or no pay. Trying to move up in placement is almost near to impossible too.
bad,Target was a great place to work when I started with the company but it just went downhill. I was never given the opportunity to move up even though I knew the job the best they rather bring in outside help and hire as a team lead and when they start the work they don't stay because  you are left to work by yourself and it is overwhelming and they cant handle it so they don't last. I was a full time employee who go my 40 hours but then new management comes in and they cut hours and cut me down to 25 to 30 hours. You would think they would take care of their employees that have been there for a long time first before the new hires but that's not what they do there.
bad,"Target can be an okay place to work if you're in the right department and have a manager that actually cares. I worked as a Cart Attendant for a year and by the time I left, we had a total of 5 resignations within just the Cart Attendants. "
bad,"They promise hours and do not deliver. Target wants you take ownership of your work area/duties but will have you work on something in another area so you area is neglected. Then ask why nothing is complete.  Do not take a vacation they are terrible about inputting your vacation hours, this seems to be resolved by escalating to a corporate level. So you will have a short check because the hours will be on another."
bad,Just too much work that needed to be done. Always adding something that needed to be done but never took anything off your plate. Asset protection leader was responsible for the protection of the store but there was so many task that needed to be done made it impossible to focus on lifters.
bad,"You go in, work yourself into a sweat while unloading, then everyone disperses and stocks shelves until it's time to leave."
bad,The schedule was subject to frequent changes throughout the year. One week you might work 12 hours and the next week 48. Start times also changed frequently and could be difficult for anyone with sleeping difficulties working the early morning shift. Perhaps upper management pays more appropriately and has better benefits but low-wage labor is stuck earning near minimum wage with a constantly changing schedule.
bad,Starting this job was a dream. As each week went on it became obvious that the upper management was more concerned about getting their bonus than properly staffing the store. I worked in the Starbucks cafe and we were subjected to 90 plus degree heat regularly even after explaining and complaining to the store manager. The entire store is constantly understaffed so each worker is expected to do the work of 2-3 people. Many days I am unable to take my breaks because there are not enough people working to cover my area. I've worked 8+ hour days with only a lunch break that is mandatory.
bad,"constantly bothered by upper managment, who were never on the same page. Low career oppurtunity advancement. unwilling to work around desired schedules."
bad,I worked here awhile it was a good place to work everyone was friendly I loved helping the customers the store was always clean. I learned alot about how the store was ran.
bad,"This particular target is not the place if your skin color isn't white. The atmosphere there was extremely uncomfortable not only because of racial differences,  but because it was highly cliquey. Seemed like some of us workers there couldn't even breathe without being watched. Tread lightly with this place."
bad,"Company as whole is pretty good and they promote from within. But the particular store i worked at, the management did jot know how to lead or speak with employees. One particular manager was demeaning to his subordinates and it was just accepted that that was how he acted."
bad,Work life balance is none excistent  Hr is terrible Leadership is bad pay is ok since yearly raise expectations are high but work level is higher than personnel given
bad,I was a seasonal I had very little training and no guidance. The next day after training I was starting work. Very fast paced and poor management. Poor staffing on the registers
bad,"I got hired at target as a full time worker. Things were great. You got to see the diversity and culture of the place. Until drama was going around like it was high school and little did I know, the hours that target has promised to give me and some coworker was giving us less and less hours. Keep in mind this was high season. AND WE WERE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE FULL TIME WORKERS! The pay was decent almost great actually, but it was not enough for the things we do and had to put up with. Another thing, the managers or LODs walk around the store with their Starbucks drinks like they’re from Mean Girls instead of actually doing their work. Like they’re some clique or something. They’re not even monitoring the customer or the workers around them. They literally don’t do anything. No matter how hard you worked, none of the things you’ll do will be recognized unless you’re really close to management. And this was not just happening at my target, it was also happening at another target near downtown. I hear things from my friend and some workers  there as well when I visit and ask how things are going. Things are just not going good for these two locations... and corporate doesn’t see it."
bad,Most of the managers are cool but the workload is ridiculous. They got rid of overnight and backroom to save money but now everyone has to do their jobs too with no pay raise. Minimum pay for maximum workload. Definitely not worth the pay.
bad,"They never hire managers from outside even though they advertise due to EEO Policy."
bad,"After a while the work seems never ending. The management seem fairly unequipped. The main ""store director"" came in as an ETL  and does not understand what it means to be a Team Member amd how things do not always work just because she wants them to. She is very egotistical and only worries about the business and not her team members. Even the new employees lost their effort to work in less than 6 months. She stresses everyone. Do yourself a favor don't work at a small format store."
bad,"I started working there 4 years ago.  I loved my job and couldn't wait to come to work.  They now have changed everything and how your job is and it is terrible.   The have people in apparel now running electronics so good luck if you have a question.   Probably the worst thing though is how they have forced employees to change their hours.  In the store I work at they even tried to force a team lead to cancel a approved trip because the new store manager tried to say it wasn't her weekend off.  It's just awful, stay away!  Maybe a decent PT job but don't make it a career.   They screw you over every time they can and make you work holidays.  I've been in retail for over 25 years and this is probably the worst place I have been."
bad,Work here at your own peril.  Expect to do the work of 3 people to be told your not working hard enough because you are not doing the work of 4 people
bad,"The management was not good, the leaders were never ever on the same page and they never took what I had to say into consideration and just write me off and would ask me to work in other areas in the store that would take me away from my daily tasks."
bad,"Experienced a lack of understanding from management. Witnessed extremely qualified and loyal employees be past up for promotions. There was no respect for employees, in fact it was a complete disregard for them as people in general."
bad,The pay was good and some of the managers were cool. That being said some were huge dicks one day I wore a black shirt cause I saw other people wearing one. And then I get yelled at and I was never told the floor team couldn’t wear these shirts.
bad,Over the years things have drastically changed. New management over the front end decided to cut everyone to 4hr shifts! I am a single mother! How can I possibly support my 2 kids with 20-24 hrs a week! Obviously was forced to put in a 2 weeks!  It’s sad to have a manager care more about cutting out lunches than their hard working team members! I hope Target gets back to caring about team members. Seasoned team members make the stores better. Take care of them they take care of the stores!
bad,"As I’m writing this I’m working overnight for my store’s remodel and when I get back I’ll be presentation TM but even now I’m seeing changes for our dayside team. Just judging now our store and I bet the company are less focus on guest and more about selling all the stock we have in our OVERSTOCK backrooms, which we can’t even move or push because are store used to have team members everywhere but hours have been cut so bad that guest tell me and overnight people that they barely see anyone. Honestly at this store we’ve lost more then half the time and I was wish I was joking but I’m not, even our etls have quit or have spoke their mind of the companies change. I stayed for this remodel because of two reason, the 40hours I was promised and my friend who needed people he could trust to do the work. After this remodel I plan on leaving very soon after a much needed vacation. Also many people who’ve worked and busted our butts gain no real pay raise but new people coming in with more pay and less responsibilities. That’s a BIG middle finger for those who are trying to make a career in the company."
bad,"You will put out your own merchandise for whatever department you work in. (Unless your a cashier) You will be pushed to your limits many days and the ""Team Leaders"" are not leaders at all!! They are just there to push you harder so that you make them look good for management. Very little training. Everybody complains to each other about how big their work load is. You will also be a backup cashier"
bad,"I liked working for Target in the beginning but they've been increasingly micromanaging their employees in completely unnecessary ways. For reference, we have to fill out a sheet of paper every day that tracks our sales and guest interactions. The work is monotonous and there is NO opportunity for growth beyond your position if you aren't already in an upper position. "
bad,Working over night unloading trucks and  distributing packages through the store for employees to start restocking the store So when we get done were go back and help restock the store.
bad,"I was trying to go to school at he time and and they would not accommodate around my schedule,  one day working overnights couple days later day shifts."
bad,"There is no ""full-time"" at Target, you could be scheduled 40 hours and at the end of the week you will end up with 30. I worked there for 4 years and never got a raise. The schedule is never a sure thing, i was asked to come in early, take this day off, come in that day, and leave early other days."
bad,It was an ok job to have once moving to texas but hours arent good so pay isnt that good either alot of college students work there and fresh out of highschool as well so a little immature.
bad,"It really all depends on what it is they have you working on. Personally, I basically did a lot. At least it felt like a lot compared to what I started out doing. Originally I had just showed up and pushed freight as it was my first job. Slowly I began to pick up more work around the store which I was okay with, except I was constantly rushed daily to work faster and I felt that I didn't get as much help as I should have received. At times, I felt like I couldn't go to anyone for help or else I might be seen as not reliable to get the job done. I did learn a lot from the right people honestly. I did feel confident working and doing my job. I had an idea and I was set on getting it done. I was confident training other people to do my job and so on. For me, a typical day wasn't so stressful as I had remembered it until the short period where I had owned a part of the store which honestly was the most stressful part about my first tenure with the company. The hardest part of my job, like I said, was owning a part of the store and not getting the proper help when needed or even when explained to higher-ups. The most enjoyable part of my job was basically everything else outside of management. I loved my co-workers and still do. I loved helping out the guests and explaining things throughout the store. Whenever I got help doing something, I really did appreciate it as it made my day that much easier and better. Do I miss working there? To an extent, yes. What I don't miss is the management and some of the higher-ups as I felt that they mistreated some people from time to time. Overall,"
bad,"When I first started working there, I loved it. I stayed busy and everyone was very nice. They often had snacks and beverages in the break room, just to boost morale and show appreciation. But as time went on, it was hard not to notice how poorly this place is managed and run. Management will not just let you work and get the job done, they are constantly on your back and coming up with new policies. They are severely understaffed, and often cut the hours of the staff that they do have, which leads to the team being over worked and stretched too thin. They are implementing policies to put the work of 3 people on one person, so they don’t have to pay multiple people, but then they don’t want to give you the hours to get the extra duties done. By far the worst place I’ve ever worked."
bad,My job in the produce and meat departments was very physically demanding with a lot of walking around and helping customers. There was a huge attention to helping customers at the cashiering lanes so I was not always able to get my job done properly.
bad,It was enjoyable at first but then you realize how backstabbing they are because they dont care how hard you worked for them. The manage ment was great until things started to change and people without any sense of leadership started to ruin people’s life with lies and false accusations
bad,"Job requirements are there when you first apply then your immediate managers and upper management leads give you other tasks while you're still trying to do your daily required activities.If you complain about something because it is extremely flawed or frustrating, nothing usually is resolved or fixed."
bad,"Nobody wanted to take responsibility for any inconsistencies throughout the work environment. We, many times, found our hours getting cut because they wanted to hire more. There were some amazing learning experiences from Target, however most people were severely bullied out of their job by higher up management in the store."
bad,When the most recent STL took over things changed. And not for the better. She is too immature for this position. This made for a poor change to morale. A lot of people are leaving this store. I worked there for 10 years and have never seen a change like this. And even when the higher ups came to visit nothing changed.
bad,"Very long hours, poor management, corporate is very political and recognition was scarce. There was potential for it to be great for me but with my poor managers it, unfortunately, was not."
bad,Woking at target wa stressful. They were unfair with providing hurts they played favoritism. Made it difficult to move up in your career and none of the managers were on he same page. The work environment was always so hostile. The guesy behave better than the stafff.
bad,"The job paid well (12.50 and hour) however, management for softlines was rude and constantly took advantage of leadership status. Nothing the employees did was ever good enough and management styles were not compatible. Expectations changed dramatically depending on who was supervising that day. Therefore, for a new hire it was incredibly difficult to know what tasks to prioritize on any given day. Hours were not flexible."
bad,A great place just needs new management. When my aunt passed away they weren’t very supportive and would get upset if I switched my schedule. I felt as if I didn’t not have support from management at all
bad,Everyone is restricted to work part time unless management asks you to stay over same day. Schedule is inconsistent. Pay isn't worth everything you have to do. They tend to put too much on one person or if an employee confronts them about an issue involving how they have no help nothing gets done about it they simply expect you to do everything yourself. And discounts aren't worth it.
bad,There is no career advancement here if your manager doesn’t like you. I had a jealous manager who never got any credit for all of my accomplishments and treated everyone really bad.
bad,Not the best because people suck but good pay and okay staff so overall would recommend but be careful it might not be for you. If you don’t like people it’s not the job for you.
bad,"Working for target in the beginning was great. After working there for over a year, management was really unprofessional, and my team lead was spreading rumors about me and talking about me to other co workers. The LOD, STL and HR proceeded to do nothing when multiple team members brought this to their attention."
bad,"I worked at the Super Target in Woodstock, GA for a couple months shy of three years. In that time I saw my fellow team members grow more and more disenchanted as time went by. I believe that a lot of Targets are managed as franchise businesses are. Meaning that some stores are not as poorly managed as others. The Target I worked at has been in operation nearly twenty years. In that time sales have mostly dwindled and substantial hours have become more difficult to have. I worked in Produce my whole time there and for the first two years was given two hours each morning to cull before the store opened. Now team members are given only an hour to do a job that used to take almost the entirety of two. All while being expected to be just as thorough as before. Add to that the increased workload of daily trucks, orders, and being solely responsible for the department's auto-fills. The Woodstock, GA Super Target also isn't the type of employer that provides much training. I could go on and on, but won't. Take my advice and look for employment elsewhere."
bad,theres a lot of politics involved with promotions.  And management does not care about the employees.   employees often dont get enough hours to get a livable wage
bad,Unfortunately they have shifted their focus to the profit and not the team. This has created a more negative vibe throughout and a lack of positive recognition as I saw when I first started my career at target. Lots of micro managing happens now and  not much trust in the leadership to run the team and produce results.
bad,"Helped with unloading the trucks, restocking shelves and also making sure guests were taken care of. Learned about retail and how it works. It was difficult to get work done in a timely manner when having to assist guests but I did get to meet a few good people while working their."
bad,You hardly get any hours what so ever. You only get about 16 hours within 2 weeks that definitely isn’t fair and your check is only about two hundred dollars. That’s not enough
bad,I was bullied by the then Starbucks Team Lead Flora. She told her team members not to talk to me or help me when i needed help. She was the only reason why i quit. she LITERALLY bullied me.
bad,"Great pay. Our store starts at $12/hr. I got hired for seasonal help. As with any job in retail around the Holidays it was no problem getting 40 hours a week. In my honest opinion my position could be a lot more organized. There seems to be only a handful of managers that really care."
bad,I would only work here temporarily and I wouldn’t do it as a seasonal thing it’s not fair or worthwhile for the things you do. I get to do everyone else’s job when I have a million things to do already enough
bad,Target has its positives and negatives. The management at target is poor and they only care about themselves and not their employees. They put their own work in front of others.
bad,"I applied to work at Target and got hired as a seasonal associate. First of all I applied for two departments and they did not place me where i applied to work in the store, management worked me in grocery department where it was to heavy for me and a dangerous situation because I am a 50 year old woman, for example I would have to climb way up on a ladder, pull stock, load it on a cart, haul it out on the sales floor to find it did not even fit, I would have to haul it back, climb back up the ladder with heavy boxes and re back stock it..I found this Corporation to be both dishonest and counter productive, I was also lied to a couple of times. I was told if I had perfect attendance and I did a good job that I could continue after the holiday, and I did just that, then the Corporation lied and reduced my hours after I had quit my job I had for 14 years to work there to stop commuting out of state for employment. I moved from California to Arizona due to the housing crisis and i needed a local job to support myself. I would never recommend working at this Corp. to anyone."
bad,"One person being pulled in multiple directions. Not flexible with schedules, especially with students. Upper management is not on the same page about how the store is to be run."
bad,Target culture makes it hard to work your way up. You are promised the world but then they never deliver. They are going through massive changes at the moment and at this point there is a lot of unknowns as to what their leadership structure is going to look like.
bad,"The first 6-8 months with Target were as magical as retail allows itself to be. Not even a year into Target the culture, the extremely high and almost unrealistic expectations, have become unbearable. I've met numerous associates within the Target world, that when I first got hired. They bled the Target colors and backed that logo up 100%. Just a little over 3.5 years into the company, those same people are as miserable as I have ever seen an employee within any company. It's truly sad, and I'm not quite sure why the all of a sudden change. I've been successful at every single job I've ever had, and this one makes me feel like I am beyond worthless. I work hard, I know I'm intelligent, and I've been showed what being valued is all about. I will be happy the day that I no longer say that I am employed with Target."
bad,This is a review I wish not to give. Although when I began working for target I loved loved loved the team. After 2 injuries outside the job it became difficult for me to stand long hours or lift heavy items. I couldn't handle it anymore. This is where compassion was not felt.
bad,Unless you are on placed on the toy team you will be treated terribly in this store. The Buford location is full of people that are not ready to truly train people and then they fully expect you to know how to do the job.
bad,Great as a first time job or 2nd part time. Logistic Team member  can be expected to be scheduled on truck days for as least 4 hours.Your work hours can vary weekly due to budget and payroll. You can be given opportunity to train in other departments so that you can pick up more hours if it is available. Majority of the employees at the store are part-timer. Corporate sets expectation of the time frame when workload should be complete and the forecast sale that the store is expect to meet each day.
bad,"In the past 4 years that I have worked for target it has gone down tremdously. Management is getting worse, hours get cut, more and more people stop showing up everyday."
bad,Nothing to talk about target . its was lame an not working good place to work at all wanna fine somthing better to provide a good job i can acount on.
bad,"Constantly changing procedures. No recognition program for employees. Very little job security. Payroll cuts are devastating with standards that are not achievable. Management is told they are not allowed to use payroll as an ""excuse"" for not making goals."
bad,"I worked at target for over two years and the process we would go about the unload, stocking, and customer service would change weekly. The management never communicated with each other or employees so there was constant confusion. They would never have enough hours for the amount of staff they had so no one was allowed to work over four hours a day which led to less than 12 hours a week for most. Managers were extremely sexist and would say things along the lines of girls are only allowed to work in makeup since they are not mentally or physically capable to work in other areas. The Target company is extremely selfish and will only allow employees that are compliant and will not listen to any complaints. HR deducts pay without telling anyone so be careful and always check your paychecks through EHR."
bad,"got a taste of some real work before the store went under"
bad,"High stress, go go go job , not enough hours, bad hours and low paid , lots of heavy lifting, they wouldn’t give me enough hours to get bentwood support my family."
bad,"I was always miserable during work. Most of the managers are some what rude. My colleges were nice, but our breaks are short and everybody at work was also always miserable. I had to call and go in MANY times before they'd look at my resume and every time they'd give me an excuse why they hadn't yet. Horrible communication skills."
bad,"It's really an easy-ish job, but I rarely get shifts longer than 4 hours and management can be difficult. It really depends on location. I have worked at two different Targets and at my first Target I had a really great experience, but when I transferred after moving it was very difficult and the work environment was very different."
bad,district leadership has no balances to prevent them from being abusive and HR does not take action against this environment. It does pay well however.
bad,this wasn't the worst place in the world to work but i felt under appreciated by management and felt that nobody was going anywhere it was okay for a while but would not want to work there again
bad,The normal team members make it fun to work there but management is just awful. They want you to do their job for them while they sit around just drinking Starbucks. There is also no communication with each other so if one tells you to do something someone else will tell you the complete opposite. The worse though is if one of them is having a bad day they take it out on the whole store. It’s really stressful. They also will only promote people who are just as lazy as they are so they can sit around and talk with them. If you are a hard worker they keep you in your position and make you do your job plus their job for minimum pay.
bad,"Mandatory 56+ hours per week for at least 6 months out of the year."
bad,"Target is a waste of time to me. The pay may be decent and if you need to you can pick up some shifts, but overall being here does nothing but suck the life out of you. You’ll walk inside the building drained and depressed. If you feel like you’d enjoy it then by all means knock yourself out."
bad,The grocery department is run all wrong.I believe the system that was set up was designed by a college graduate who never actually worked in retail and their concepts sounded good on paper.I have worked for other major chains and they do things completely differently and backwards.The automated ordering system sucks.Backrooms are set up terribly with items weighing more than 35-50 lbs stacked almost to the roof on high shelves that you have to climb up a ladder to reach.There is poor rotation all over the department.No cleaning program and dairy/meat sections were filthy.No organization to complete work.High turnover and veteran employees seem to be going through motions not wanting to improve and just collect paychecks.Unless they improve how they do things they won’t be able to attract seasoned talent to improve how this department is operated
bad,I don't really have a review because I was there for the Christmas season and left due to a miscarriage so it was unfortunate. Im not sure if I could go back but I don't even think it's worth trying.
bad,Of all the paces i have worked at in my life Target's management system was the worst and i just felt like they didn't care about us and we did a lot of work that was not part of our duties but for the same pay
bad,the most important job that all team members have is to make the store leader look good on reports and in district manager visits.  corners are cut.  numbers are fudged.  lies are told.  nothing else matters.  nothing.
bad,"Target offers decent health benefits, but has a fairly toxic work environment. Employees are expendable, and treated as such, since it's typically easier to maintain a high turnover rate than it is to give out raises or any form of performance bonus outside of the occasional stuffed Target dog or $20 gift certificate, though even those are rare."
bad,The best thing about working here was getting a discount at the store. The store was poorly managed and the employees were very disgruntled. The customers always make the job harder and sometimes give you a very bad attitude.
bad,"Felt just exactly like a number, they preached and preached safety but it was a daily happening of having 150-200% of your expected daily workload to be crammed down your throat.  Management was very disconnected from the labor force."
bad,"Hard to move up from store level. They always ""expect more"" out of you with no new compensation ""pay less"". The people are fun but aren't worth the poor compensation or schedule."
bad,The job is good for high school kids flexible hours and understanding managers lot of times you won't get a 40 hour week it will not let you get more than 40 hours a week the only thing you get is a discount car two weeks after working with them the boss's was okay but a little bit difficult
bad,Management is constantly changing. There is no job security.  The pay is extremely low compared to the expectations. They limit the amount of leads and give too much responsibilities to team members.
bad,"Bad management, no potential for raises. Constantly always busy, sometimes not paid on time. Pay was always low and they treated employees bad once new people were hired. Treated just like a number once they met there quota for hiring new people."
bad,"I would not recommend applying for Flow Team at the Rancho Cordova, CA Target. The whole entire store is a complete mess but other work centers aren't as stressful as Flow. The job itself is very easy it's just stocking freight onto shelves. The worst part is dealing with management. ETLs lack common sense and incredulously oblivious to how logistics work, especially the current Logistics ETL. This situation recently got MUCH worse after they started a new process that completely changed everything. Sometimes, they'll even time you with their phones and annoy you over the walkie until your finished. This job gives you very little hours outside the holidays. Management says they have no payroll but will consistently hire new people who always quit a month later. Flow Team is constantly understaffed. No future here and things will get worse as time progresses if they don't get rid of the current ETLs. The only good thing about this job is that people on Flow Team are very nice and helpful."
bad,"Management needs improvement. At first it seemed like an amazing place to work, after awhile people showed their true colors and now there are days I dred going to work."
bad,"Worst management I have ever seen in my 20+years in maintenance field.  Target only cares about safety if it doesn't cost them any money or if it doesn't cost them downtime.  They have absolutely ZERO budget for training!!!  Very mind numbing job!!"
bad,"I work in receiving quick pace teamwork rotation work environment hands on scan of boxers make sure they go in the right area of the right truck , the company was okay need a better career with more money"
bad,My specific role has the requirements of the position above but not the pay. I am held accountable for the same responsibilities as my direct boss but am not compensated properly for it.
bad,Management creates toxic workplace for employees by treating workers with unfair temper and attitude. Unnecessary tasks are asked to be done due to laziness of managers and store managers.
bad,"The work isnt hard but theres always too much to get done. between juggling customers, stocking shelves, zoning shelves, blah blah blah blah word count blah blah"
bad,"It's a corporate environment, management is always trying something new but it's not an efficient machine. It seems under staff in certain areas which could benefit in those areas."
bad,"it was a very fast paced job, bur it was not fun. i would rather work for mcdonald than target; although the pay was awesome the managers were the worst."
bad,"Work environment is only about performance and not about realistic goals, metrics or the team. If you love not having a life and the life you do have is full of stress, then working at Target is for you!"
bad,"IT department has undergone radical changes in the last four years and is no longer the dedicated, professional organization it once was. While changes were needed the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of open source."
bad,They treat you good at the start but over time it seems like newer team members get treated better than ones who had been there for longer. The benefits are alright but its hard to meet the hour requirement to even receive them.
bad,works hours were inconsistent once workload was done you were sent home and wasnt able to see full hours not reliable if you have to pay real bills only food money lol
bad,"Every day feels the same.  Everything is based on the amount of time you've worked for Target.  There is really no incentive to go above and beyond work.  If you enjoy doing repetitive tasks and exceeding the quota only to be told you need to be faster than this is the job for you.  Also, Target is a corporation obviously, so everything is geared toward safety.  One could say maybe too much.  They will claim no such thing but when the safety rules inhibit your ability to meet quotas.  They don't understand why new rules make it hard for you to meet those quotas.  Management is meh.  They don't really hire managers from within if you don't have a suitable degree.  This job can also be extremely taxing on your body depending on which position you are put in for the day.  Sometimes you could be moving for 12 hours with only 15 minute breaks every couple of hours."
bad,"Change is a culture, and that is the culture at Target. Just when you think you are leading your team to success, priorities change. That's understandable in a dying industry (brick and mortar retail), but it's a drain on employees. Overall, Target compensates well, but you earn it."
bad,"Some of the biggest issues from my experience are; the lack of work hours while work task remains excessive for the allotted time frame, terrible management, a disregard for employee safety, negligence towards OSHA regulations and a lack of self-efficiency."
bad,"Managers obviously picked favorites and would make you feel like an outcast if you were not one of them. They promised to work with your scheduling availability, then scheduled the exact opposite from what you requested. It seemed like there was no way for myself or my coworkers to move up in the company, even in a long-term sense."
bad,"Good fit for people who are in school, high school or college. They may be willing to work with your schedule. You have to be open to help customers no matter what the problem may be. Patience is very important. No matter what position you are hired for you will also have to help at the register."
bad,"little team got to know my coworkers. As a team member, there was a lot of responsibility, and this job required great leadership skills. I would help guests and make sure the sales floor looked clean at all times. The guest was always right and with that policy, I delivered the best customer service at the guests’ request. I also had to train new employees in my department."
bad,"managers are very young and were not serious about training. we had certain goals to reach each night but with all the unsafe picking locations and warehouse issues, it was hard to reach your goals each night. sometimes you come in for your regular 10 hr shift and 2 hrs before you get off they will come tell you that they decided to do mandatory 2 extra hrs. good paying tho"
bad,"Working at Target gets very annoying. Customers arrive like they just woke up, feeling like they should be rude to everyone they see, especially the cashier. People are rude and Target's rules are, "" customers/guests are always right"". Working there was boring and not worth the pay you receive."
bad,"I had a hard time moving around because of their 90 day rule, so I hated coming to work but they moved someone who started the same time as me into another department and that wasn't fair."
bad,at target you would walk in a just get depressed knowing in some way shape or form you were most likely going to get harassed by at least one person in upper management and ridiculously micro-managed.
bad,A typical sweat shop. They over work everybody with quotas that are nearly impossible to meet. There is no benefit to working here besides a paycheck but for a young person that wants a decent check and 4 days off a week its not bad.
bad,"Target is a great entry level job that teaches you different departments and how to better your people skills. It's biggest issues are the lack of career advancement within the company, the lack of hours and the unrealistic goal expectations put on teamembers in the time they are given. Some jobs are worse than others both in hours distributed but also in the workload expected. If you do plan on working here you need to have the mindset that you will be working and not goofing around or they will not keep you."
bad,"The management was the worst part of working for target other than that the job itself was not all that bad, at times the environment would get stressful and hectic when the cashiers were swamped. The most enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers the relations between coworkers were very good. I learned how to use the cashier system and gained experience in customer service. The management often would give conflicting instructions."
bad,"It might have just been me but everyone i worked with had an attitude and acted like they hated their job which gave a negative vibe in the air. I was new to the whole retail thing and it was my first job so I was already scared bc I have social anxiety and I was trying to get over it but co workers had attitudes towards me for no reason and I barely talked to anyone. They may have been like that because I was new but it still sucked and I felt like I wasn't really part of the team and I always got sad when I went into work. Dont get me wrong there were nice co workers, but the rude ones outweighed the nice ones. I was only there for around 3 months so I never got a really big picture of everything and the people so i can't really say i truly know the people and the job extremely well."
bad,"Leader said she'd fire me for not talking to guests, though it's most of what I do every day & she cares more about meeting sales goals than employees"
bad,"a lot of confusion was had with my scheduling"
bad,"I worked in hardlines, but I was unaware that I was working 3-5 jobs at once. I was given carts full of random items and expected to put back each and every item in its respected area from day one. Not only was that difficult due to the faulty devices we were given, we were expected to clear cart after cart (the workload was increased if a team member didn't pick up the slack and gets off work early). It would be even worse if it's a busy day and team members are mandated to help every customer that we run into. Some days are slow and some days are awful. I mean yeah, the easiest work day was still incredibly stressful due to the management (Leader on duty) constantly breathing down your neck and judging every single thing you do, but hey at least my coworkers were pretty nice so there's that."
bad,"i worked for Target of 6 years the first 4 were really good great management then in 2016 when the new management came in it became about who you knew and the alliances that were made along with the friendships. Unless you were good with management you got the hours and the chance to move app in your work. I knew every area, worked every area yet i was denied new jobs and to move up because i had kids and a set schedule. the management made life hard unless you were friends with them trouble was created over little things like your work ethic. Target has become like a high school all about popularity and who you know. definitely love the company but my target not the best target. t-7055"
bad,"You go to work unload, stock and backstock trucks. Pull orders for online purchases. Customers service.  Every department thinks you work for them only and there is no communications between departments.  Management does not support their workers.  People who don't show up for work get no recourse no matter how many times they don't show up."
bad,"When I began years ago it was more relaxed. High turnover not just for employees, but management as well. I've watched many LODs come and go over almost 7 years. Corporate has gone overboard in the last year trying to implement new ways of doing things. They are currently trying to push sales goals and a more boutique atmosphere that almost all softlines employees are not comfortable with. If you LOVE sales and like to push people into buying as many things as possible without commission, then you may enjoy this job and thrive. It's descent pay for what you do, bou must really enjoy retail. Management is stressed out by corporate and tend to micromanage the employees."
bad,"You will continuously be looked over for advancement unless you become friends with the store manager. Raises are level with Target increasing starting wages which is great for people starting there, but it means that you can work there for 5 years and be making the same as someone hired yesterday. Management generally doesn't solve problems, expect to solve them yourself and if you're a good worker, expect to be asked to do other people's jobs for them. It's not a bad job temporarily, but I wouldn't advise working there long term"
bad,If you have responsibilities Target is not the way to go. They hire a lot of employees so that they can only pay as little as possible and you only get about 10/15 hours a week. They have very high expectations with such poor management. For target to be such a huge million dollar company they are very cheap when it comes to taking care of their employees.
bad,"Management is horrible, team leads, store lead, and general leaders all expect you to complete different tasks at the same time. Very little communication with the higher ups. The pay is great, but the stress levels are questionable."
bad,"Shockingly, I expected the atmosphere to be more upbeat but the management level truly ruined these expectations. I also expected training, but that is severely lacking as well. Most of my work is figuring things out on my own and trying to take bits and pieces from observing others and tailoring each shift to whoever is the lead manager that night. With no consistency in expectations for what is expected of me and management that is critical but does not take the time to actually train you= very disappointed and not looking forward to staying with the company long term."
bad,"I worked in a Starbucks inside of a Target and we were treated as completely different employees from the rest of the store. All of the ETLs just sit around, watching videos on their phones, tv in the break room, and gossiping, while complaining about your productivity. They have no clue what is done at starbucks because they're only knowledgeable about Target, yet occasionally would try to direct you on how to do your job. Communication is EXTREMELY poor. We would have call-offs and never be told. Constantly have to rearrange your schedule because of their poor planning. Also, extremely clique-y. Poor work was rewarded and higher standards were set for better workers. Good pay for the job, but the environment is toxic and I definitely would not recommend."
bad,"Target is a typical retail job with below than average management. Target corporation tries to implement fun ideas and incentives for their employees but hires fresh college graduates with no experience as upper management who typically have no idea what they are doing, thus promotes a toxic workplace culture. I was able to strengthen my costumer service skills and have tougher skin towards people that are rude. I would recommend this job to young people who still need to gain work experience or need the pay check while they are working towards advancing their careers."
bad,"If you need a job that's temporary def apply to target, that management is that is going to make this company fall. Everyone who i started with got fed up and left or straight just walked out."
bad,I worked at a not so busy Target in the produce department. We would on the weekly throw away tons of food because the food bank we used to donate to closed. we were told to order what was needed to fill the shelves and even that would go bad and we'd have to throw it out. These big box retailers do not pay living wages. I started at 10 an hour with 3 years of managerial experience in retail stores. I would recommend only taking this job if you're hard up for cash because the pay is pathetic.
bad,"I gave 3 years of my life to this place and in the end they never cared, worked my butt off for them and i ended up just being a number. Pay is great, but not worth it in the long term."
bad,"I loved it there in the very beginning. Good atmosphere, and good opportunities to get more hours. As of recent they are cutting hours yet expecting the same amount of work to get done with less time to do it. It is a stressful climate for many at this moment."
bad,busy work day
bad,"Again another work place that doesn't seem to care about their employees at least on the night shift crew. Always fast pace, and yet little to no reprieve against work load."
bad,Work it self was not hard the hours were hard to do went in at 4am left at 12 in the after noon all ways busy changing holiday themes constantly and new displays going up daily
bad,I was Okay. always working on weekends. Casual atmosphere  and black Friday was getting earlier and earlier. Expensive health insurance. Not sure I would return to work there
bad,As a merchandise flow team member my day typical consists of unloading the days truck of in coming products and stocking shelves. Management in the store i worked in was completely opaque about the direction the company was headed and the reasoning behind many of the policy changes that directly effected employees. They were also infamous for casting aspersions toward employees in conversation. There was strong camaraderie between low level employees but management was seldom discrete about whom they favored. the hardest part of the job was the gradual decline in time and man power given to complete identical tasks over my years of employment. The most enjoyable part was the friends I made working there
bad,We would throw the truck then take out the pallets to the floor and stock the shelves. have a small meeting before we started and they would tell us how we were doing usually just okay.
bad,"The current management in the store I worked was dishonest, more of a high school atmosphere among them as well.  The management had a high turn over rate in less than 5 years out of 12 leadership postions there were over 50 people in these postions who are no longer with the company which made doing your job very difficult."
bad,New experience was ok meet new people love their quality of clothes & shoes but didn’t like management or store CEO really poor lack of communication & favoritism
bad,at the beginning of my days working at target it was good but 6 months in was not what i imagined my management did not want to see me grow i never felt comfortable to talk to my management i loved working with everyone else
bad,"I honestly thought that target would be a great place to work at. I love the store, I love shopping at it, but working there? That was an entirely different story. Don't get me wrong, the other associates in my department were amazing and one of my LODs were great! But the other LODs? they could care less about you. The environment was super stressful and you would be put on projects but if you weren't part of the Hardlines sales floor then you weren't really recognized for what you did. I was basically working Full-Time hours but getting Part-Time pay & benefits. The discount is 10%, which sucks by the way, and if you aren't paying with cash then the discount doesnt work. The only positive thing about the job was the people in my department. everything else basically sucked."
bad,It was no room for advancement i worked for Target for 14years and was never allowed to advance. I was a great worker and always got my work done on time. They wanted to keep me on the team I was on because i was one of the best workers on my team i even worked while i was pregnant completing difficult tasks a pregnant women shouldnt be doing I just got tired of feeling unappreciated.
bad,Lack of knowledge from the team leader made it easy for constant confusion and chaos when present. Besides that fun environment when dealing with the Starbucks aspect of the job. Being able to use your own creativity with drinks was a cool experience.
bad,"As an Executive Team Lead, you are overworked to unhealthy measures. All Managers either could not stop gaining weight or could not stop losing weight, due to stress reactions."
bad,"Target was a decent place to begin my work experience in terms of what I was tasked to do, however the hours were very unfriendly especially for someone who has never had a job. I would often be asked to work from 4PM-2AM, only to then resume working the next day from 9AM-4PM. This took a large toll on my mental health."
bad,Ok workplace management was kind of bad but good place to work for if u hit something u had to report it but that was understandable and had a high quality production
bad,"Its hard when someone wants to grow... Yet you feel your not able to.I would do it to have a pay check to pay bills. But that's it."
bad,There seemed to be enough people to get everything done on my shift. Always had several people calling out then the company would limit the hours and send people home.
bad,"It's a great place to work in spring, summer and early fall. 40 hours a week and the work pace is not overly fast. Late fall and winter (holiday season) it's terrible. Will find yourself working up to 72 hours a week for mandatory overtime. For some reason, they refuse to hire a decent amount of seasonal workers and just add insane amount of hours to their regular employees. I worked 4p-2am Tues-Fri normally, which was great, but during mandatory overtime season they added on extended shifts (staying till 4a instead of 2a on my normal shifts) and also adding up to two weekend overtime shifts from 6p-6a. No work/life balance whatsoever. Management expects you to process and pack up to 4000 items, depending what zone you are working. You will be questioned if you are not meeting your numbers during peak seasons, even if the freight you are getting is huge, bulky, awkward, etc. Physically draining, very little time to sleep. You are not informed if you will be working mandatory overtime shifts until about 20 hours beforehand, which makes it very hard to make plans because you do not know if you will be working or not. Only get two 20 minute breaks on 10 hour shifts, 12 hour shifts you get one half hour break and one 25 minute break. The good news is these breaks are paid. Management will not explain company policies to you when you are hired (like the fact that there will be mandatory overtime during peak season) and then you will get written up if you point out that policies weren't explained properly. When you start, everything is confusing and you have to ask coworkers questions"
bad,"I would not recommend Target to anyone that is looking for a good full-time or even part-time work. They are horrible with hours and will not give you the hours you need, and that is the reason I will be leaving."
bad,"You are required to clean restrooms, trash cans, front end of the sales floor, and clean spills. You need to deliver carry out's, keep carts full because management will yell at you for having 2 or less packed rows of carts, carry salvage and CRC to the back of the store, take out cardboard, keep carts in clean condition."
bad,The work day was always stressful and management doesn't offer much support. You are left to figure things out on your own and communication with higher ups leaves much to be desired.
bad,"Not enough pay for the expectations and amount of work, no room for advancement, lousy pay raises and no recognition. Uneven work loads. Not enough opportunities."
bad,Clock in and race to the back to unload and organizes the boxes from the trailer onto separate plates and take them to their location and unbox in under 1 mins per box and stock them.
bad,"At first, working at Target was great...but now it has gotten way too stressful and full of unnecessary drama. Hours are not what i was promised and nothing ever gets settled when I have an issue."
bad,"They hire management only with a four year degree and it doesn't even have to do with warehousing.  So management has no idea what they are doing and make-up thing as they go, constantly changing processes and procedures."
bad,There are alot of great people but the mangement in the building is bad. they are younger than me and have no idea what is going on. they have their favorites they do not push for you to succed they will set you up for failure.
bad,Group Vp's and DTL's demanded a constant back and forth between processes making it impossible to become an expert at your job. Always shifting focuses from sales and service to operations.
bad,"I worked in the mobile sales and electronic departments. a typical day is ringing up customer, some that just don't want to wait in line so they come to electronics to check out. Some are very rude. Hours during the holidays are terrible."
bad,Sadly I did not enjoy working at Target. They were very unfriendly to their employee's. No appreciation. Their push for red cards seemed to be more important  then the customer.
bad,"They'll drop you just short of ninety days, then let you reapply, rehire you immediately, and restart the ninety day trial period, so that they don't have to give you the insurance benefits."
bad,"Target has been an interesting work experience. I've worked at two different stores, and experienced vastly different working environments. Overall the company seemed burdened by corporate policies which tended to negatively affect the individual stores."
bad,"I worked there for 2 years and remained at the same level the whole time. I was often promised either promotions or raises for my hard work and dedication but was never met with any of those even though my reviews and accomplishments were highly satisfied by all the managers. The managers themselves always picked favorites and their favorites were always other managers. I would often come up with action plans that would increase productivity and once executed and proved successful, the managers would brag to their bosses that they devised that plan and would give no mention to me or anyone else that helped. Managers also would belittle their associates in a passive aggressive way."
bad,"expect you to be a robot, and always drama. management is poor and always changing. make you so much work that seem impossible or require more people since they are always need people."
bad,The pay needs to better especially if you’ve been with target for 3 years.  Definitely need to step up their management. We shouldn’t be harassed about red cards. If we don’t get them they shouldn’t be on our butts about it.
bad,"Got hired on as a GSTL, being told by my STL that I would be promoted to an ETL position within 18 months. I have approached them multiple times, and they gaff me off. Wages for GSTL compared to other TL's are a joke for the workload."
bad,"Work life balance does not exist for hourly staff while management takes every other weekend off. There are 8 managers and often oin weekends there are only 3 managers.  If you are hourly forget what weekends are---you are lucky to get either a Sat or Sunday off."
bad,Store operations is not viewed as problem solvers.  This is a high execution role and merits were not based on performance.  There is opportunity to change the culture at Target.
bad,In my facility the working environment was horrible.  Inexperienced senior leaders led to a tremendous amount of wasted time all in an effort to try and show our GM they were engaged.
bad,"I just didn't like working for Target. Bosses never reinforced strong work ethic, just unfairly criticized bad work ethic if you were new. I really wouldn't recommend them."
bad,"This was specific to the store I worked at, but I could not stand the managers. They hit on or hook up with employees and then save their butts whenever they get into trouble for stealing or not showing up. They were so unprofessional and made it impossible to advance yourself to help change the culture. Dead end job not worth the harassment from managers on top of the normal abuse you would take from guests shopping in the store."
bad,"I do like most of the people I work with. I also like the interaction with our guests. There dosen't seem to be a goal.  They don't work as a team.  Each manager has own goal. You go in thinking you'll do one thing but it changes, according to who the manager is.  There is no accountability for actions or work for anyone managers included."
bad,"Target has a poor set of management mixed with a large about of work expected to be done. On top of a large about of tasks to be done a day there is the added work of customer service. In my particular department I managed 2 separate departments and then asked to do even more despite asking for help. My job was not to manage these departments, but since nobody else could/would do it the tasks fell to me. When I asked for a promotion to the job I was already doing I was denied with no real reason as to why, but I did get asked to step up even more."
bad,It was a great paying job for a college kid it will take a toll on your body if your not in great shape walking 15 Miles day and picking boxes and placing them on a caddy and being able to work in -15 degrees.
bad,"When I first started the job it was great. Then as the years go by they treat you like a piece of trash. If hired don't expect for them do be a team player , but they want you to be a team player"
bad,"they do not treat you like you matter as a human being, rather you are simply a labor commodity to be traded and used until you leave by your own volition or mess up in some way such that they find an excuse to let you go, but that high turnover isn't news in retail."
bad,target is a good place just some of the people there never really did what they were suppose to do. they were lazy and some always depended on others to do their work
bad,"Target has slipped lately, taking sales people from the floor and not replacing them. Many members of management started in menial positions. Great opportunity for advancement, however since most management comes from the floor there is a lot of favoritism."
bad,"No comment As America's second-largest retailer, we stay ahead in today's ultra-competitive retail market by challenging ourselves to become more efficient and more intelligent, providing guests with the best shopping experience possible. The pace is fast, the atmosphere is fun and the people are friendly. Every team member is encouraged to innovate, contribute ideas and discover solutions as an important part of a world-class team."
bad,I worked for Target Corp for 7+ years and at no time did I find any room to grow into a leadership or higher compensation position from being part of the night crew.
bad,Not a great place for someone looking for a career.A company that has high expectations for way less than what they pay. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. The most enjoyable part was educating the guests on what they were purchasing in electronics.
bad,"Target overall is a high energy, vibrant, very welcoming kind of environment. There's a few things that I would change as far as management, they go missing so often that i feel it is hard for them to witness the progress and growth of their workers. Target isn't all bad though, I've learned a lot about sales and business schemes which will help me get much further in life,"
bad,"I always enjoyed shopping there, but then I worked there.  I would hope that gives you enough insight."
bad,"They put too much of a work load on you and the pay doesn't match. Growing in the company is also hard to do even though they tell you other wise. On the up side, during holidays and special events, they provide employees with food, snacks and plenty of decorations."
bad,"A typical day of work consists of standing in front of a register waiting for guests in order to ring up their items. I've learned how to handle money and become more confident in my social skills. The management has changed about 5 times in the course of the 2+ years I've worked there. I've had some positive experiences with managers as well as negative ones. Over the past week it has been more negative, with a new manager that seems to have no regard for team members' availability. My availability isn't honored at times and has become stressful and frustrating. But overall I enjoy the people that I work with and we've all become fairly close."
bad,"The people that work at Target are very personal, and friendly, and help you when you need it. The job itself was just not for me, but I learned many physical skills along with management skills."
bad,"Working in retail taught me a lot. A far as working with the people that was there I enjoyed them. Everthing wasn't well organize to me like it should have being, but I syated and made the best of it untill I found some better."
bad,"Not a great place to work. They're attempting a lot of change (e.g. distribution network changes, moving more business online, etc.) to better compete with Walmart/Amazon. While the ideas they have are decent on paper, they're being implemented 10 years too late, and they're being implemented terribly. "
bad,"Small pharmacy. One pharmacist. Two technicians with a small shift overlap for the technicians. Work hours were limited, averaging 25 hours weekly. Great place to work to learn the basics for entry level pharmacy technicians."
bad,"Target starts off as an awesome company to work for, but after your  90 days they start to become a different company. You go from having 40 hour work weeks and awesome management to 5 and a half hour work week and management who expects you to pick up the entire store in that time frame, by yourself, during peak sales period."
bad,"This job did not have the best management team to my opinion, it had good start but a very fast and it south really fast. People getting laid off with no explanation or being forced out,"
bad,"My experience at target was a love/hate relationship, I learned a lot in that time but the hours were inconsistent and I had problems within the employees that never got resolved. The leaders allowed a lot of disrespectful behavior, overall wasn't a good fit."
bad,"Target would like every one to believe that they are amazing. On the inside track of things you see a company that does not walk the talk. The are very clicky, Politically involved, and have a lack of integrity and ethics in the work place."
bad,"Management does a poor job of handling team member's concerns or issues, and a facade is put up of being your ""friend"", whilst talking badly about you behind your back. Work load expectations are unbearably high, and staffing is extremely short-handed."
bad,I work  at Target for 12 years and never made good money. Great people I work with and plenty of great customer. Always on time and I have a lot of vacation hours.
bad,they sale you a great package but after being there for little under a year they never really gave time off for school or accommodated my schedule. coworkers are great about the only reason to stay
bad,"i enjoyed working at target very flexible sschedules and super easy job , but they dont gave a chance to improve yourself and grow professionally, also i think some people working there are very Racist."
bad,The company itself is great to work for. A typical day at work just consist of a high flow of guest because our store is located next to a tourist attraction. ive learned how to handle very high and intense situations with guest complaints. Management out my specific location was very bad. The leaders only care about themselves. there were situations where we needed them at the front end and they wouldn't  show and i would walk back to the offices and they were are laughing and talking. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the craziest guest with there anger. The easiest part of the job is speaking about the store card that we have to every guest.
bad,"The job its self inst bad at all. The problems are under staffing, poor scheduling, and bad management. Priority is no longer put on the customer, its about getting redcards and doing the job of 2 or 3."
bad,Management was horrible and rude... They is no way to move forward in the company unless your friends with management. I don't know what else to say but horrible place to be employed.
bad,"During slow times of the year (Non-holiday times) hours can be cut. Short amount of time, especially during night shifts, to get everything done with an overwhelming amount to finish."
bad,"Everyone talked behind each others backs at my store. It was literally a hot spot for gossip. The managers claimed to be supportive of my mental illness, however they did not work with me when I needed time off."
bad,"shifting hours and life balance not the best but typical retail environment.  Fun people, fair management. easy job for the money. hard hours around the holidays."
bad,This job is meant for kids in college and just starting out in life. I is not meant for someone to provide a family nor life for themselves. Therefore it is not a recommendation for anyone that want to have something out of life.
bad,"Target has been very flexible when it comes to scheduling whenever I need time off for family, etc.  "
bad,"Target isn't a place you want to be forever, the raises are horrible 10-50 cents per year if your lucky, little to no recognition for your efforts, the managers are rude and talk trash about employees."
bad,"I just did seasonal work but they didn't train us efficiently"
bad,"Very physical, long commute, friendly coworkers that would give you a helping hand when you need it. learned how to operate different equipment. They were all about #s no matter what."
bad,"A great place to work if you have 0 responsibilities, great people work there unfortunately most aren't in management, you'll never get 40 hours a week."
bad,The job required more team member functions rather than managing. On a daily basis you will walk the store and gather the team (if payroll permits) to assist you to bring the store back to brand standards. Everyday the district manager would tell you what to do and you do it.
bad,"Long hours, Team leads are mean with nasty attitudes. Dark Gloomy place to work. The work is hard to keep up with, the breaks are short and I just didn't like it at all."
bad,"The job was very easy, structural, easy going. I was able to please every customer I had an encounter with, solved all their problems and answered all questions"
bad,I worked at Pizza Hut that was inside of Target. Pizza Hut was a new environment for me cause I never worked with food before and I love learning new things.
bad,The job itself is ok but the managers were terrible and the whole staff was very clique-y. Pay wasn't good for all the assignments you have to do. Was lied to by managers on more than one occasion.
bad,Didn't give me a chance to make a good impression...too much yelling at employees..wanted us to do 8 hours of work in 4 hours so that the salary employees could leave early and hourly employees are left with low paychecks
bad,"The actual work at Target is not bad at all.  It does get boring at times but there are also times where it's kind of fun to work when you are with others.  However, when it comes to the management, the job absolutely miserable to work at.  They all condensed on each other and when it comes to one's job duties.  They also make it very hard to advance in the store or changing positions that are more appropriate for workers.  They are also rude and talk behind people's back even when they are not at work or about nonwork-related issues and the younger the worker is, no matter how hard of a worker, the worse it is.  The biggest issue I have with the management is that they have unrealistic work requirements for the hardlines and backroom team members.  They give people projects that are near impossible to do within the time they want it done and when if a worker does not finish it to their expectations he or she will receive an ear full.  Luckily, there is one very nice manager who is much more flexible and understanding if we were not able to finish in time."
bad,Have to be able to work in a fast paced environment and be able to work under a ton of pressure. Being able to multitask is a must because management always has other things they want you to focus on top of the 9 hour workload they give you.
bad,"worked and managed various departments which included reviewing"
bad,Would get to work and we as a department would go over the goals for the day. Most days would get sent home early due to lack of work. The hardest part of the job was working 12 hour shifts.
bad,"I like my job and position, but the management is very poor. The morale in the work place is not very good. They don't staff it properly and therefore all departments suffer and it shows in the way the store is left every night."
bad,"I honestly have to say this is one of the worst Targets I've ever been to. It is highly unorganized for both guests and team members. I was never even really trained for my cashiering position; it was more of a ""learn-as-you-go"" situation. I had no notice when I was let go and I had a work injury."
bad,A typical a day at work sucks. You nere know what you will be doing. No matter what you do there is always some kind of numbers you gotta hit. Even if you hit those numbers every day its never good enough for them. It seems like they are never ever going to be happy with you.
bad,Okay job.  It is what it is.  Large corporation.  The smell of popcorn as you walk in every day.  After working at Target you figure out that every Target in the world is essentially the same place.  And you feel sorry for the workers.. at least the older ones.  The younger ones just working the registers or the floor still have time.
bad,"I would not recommend. Everyone has different experiences, but I found some members of management to show favoritism often."
bad,"Good thing about working in target is that they are very flexible with their schedule , coworkers were very nice ,managers were great , the only thing that sucked was having to deal with rude customers everyday. That's something i was able to handle and control everyday though"
bad,Hours are good and pay is great but the management is horrible and every review will say the same thing and I never believed until I worked there.  The management is not professional and knows less of the job than the regular employees.
bad,"Employees and management pretty much friendly.  "
bad,"Just stay focus, mind your business and get the work down. When you have co worker you can relate with the time goes faster. Yes there are rude customers but treat them how you would like to be treated"
bad,can be a god place to work if you can get into upper management. starting off it is unprdictable with your schedule and you are expected to do the job of multiple people.
bad,"- I'd have a typical day every time i came in. If i was scheduled as a cart attendant, i'd take care of all of my responsibilities then leave. Same thing for cashier shifts."
bad,"Management is always terrible. Always. When you get assigned somewhere, be prepared to be alone for your entire shift. They CALL themselves a team, but it's not really true."
bad,"Painting lines over and over "
bad,I have been working for them for sometime then I was traveling by bus so the travel time to and from was 4 hours due to the job being on other side. i enjoyed working there for the most part but it began to take a toll on me just retail in general. Its has its pros and cons but I was ready to move on and try something different.
bad,Stocking shelves and moving shelves to new locations. Making displays when needed. Help other employees out with what they were doing.
bad,"depending on the location, opportunity for growth is limited,the hours are not flexible and reseasonable for a young family.There is a high turn over because Target is not flexible. Their employee benefit is not great and comparable."
bad,"Everyone among management is quick to praise you when you do something right- which I loved. But disdaining and bitter when things don't go their way. Over promising, under delivering, condescending superiors."
bad,A typical day at work was quite stressful stressful not knowing where you would be throughout the store. I learn how to communicate effectively to customers. Management was very poor didn't really care to much about there employees and what they went through on a regular bases. My co-workers were very nice and seemed like very well rounded people. The hardest part of the job was when they got self checkout and cut everyone's hours so you went from working 4 days a week to maybe 2. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to put a smile on customers faces and building different relationships.
bad,"It was nice at first as Target had a lot of good things going for it.  My direct manager was a wonderful person who taught me a whole bunch, but those above them really didn't know what they were doing."
bad,Target's long term outlook is positive- the company will still be present in ten years.  It will not be any easier to work for though. Headcount reductions and cost cutting make a career in-store very challenging.
bad,"I am a current team member, my experience with target has been an a roller coaster of ups and downs, ups are flexible hours and good co workers, but you rarely get recognized for going the extra mile, our store is also terribly under staffed, a position has been open for at least 3 months but no interviews have been done for it yet it says its closed for applications  and I also put in an application for a full time position for the same store but not interviewed yet, cart attendants at this store are stretched incredibly thin and we have a high rate of cart attendants leaving within their first 90 days and are expected to do a large amount of work considering I am the lowest paid department in the store, I am often asked to do work that isn't even in my job description and hardly ever recognized for it"
bad,If you want to be overworked and treated poorly this is the place for you. I've worked there for over 7 years. 5 branch managers in 7 years. Had so many supervisors I couldn't name them all. You are just a number there and speaking of numbers that's all they care about. If you have no other place to get a job then work here until you find one. Trust me don't plan to stay here long. The morale in the building has been ruined and it's not getting better anytime soon. Good Luck your gonna need it.
bad,"A typical day at work is usually busy with checking out our guests.  When it is slow there is always something to do to keep me and my fellow cashiers occupied.  There is always grab and go items like gum, snacks, candy, and mints to restock.  To maintain a neat and orderly workstation we all take turn in collecting the hand baskets, hangers and DVD safe boxes.  "
bad,"i love working for target, it just not fulfilling enough for me. i need something a little more secure and with more pay. im looking for better opportunity to better myself and family."
bad,Company policy hurt morality and undermined the company objective both long term and short term. Now the employees and store managers are going to have make sacrifices in order to compensate for the mistakes of executives. This is not a policy I wish to represent.
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with more then any aspect of the job. It was not hard to learn or do. Any trained monkey could do It. What I didn't like was that every part of management was related (mother,daughter and daughters boyfriend), Even though I was told they didn't report to each other. That might be true but they do sit down at the dinner table together ever night. They also Sat down to make the schedule together. So if u upset one you didn't get any hours.  Also the other family tree was a grandmother, mother, daughter team. The mother was the grand mother's boss. Was she a fair boss yes for the most part but favoritism is always there. Who are u going to sick up for in the long run your mom or someone else... Seriously think about it. Also don't think u will ever make a good living there unless your ok with work 12 hrs a week. There are times u can work 32 hrs but they are few and far in between  ."
bad,"After 4 years, I didn't feel valued by the store leadership, so I left and I don't ever plan to go back. I don't know everything, but I know a lot and there were times that I trained new employees."
bad,"The management was poor, never took responsibility and never helped with any projects. My coworkers were relatively competent with a few exceptions, but difficult to talk to . I would not recommend working here."
bad,"Target has a lax approach to management contact with team members, middle management is not consistent with verbal directions and follow through with directions, I learned to watch what management does and protect my back, my co- workers were easy to get along with and customers were hard to assist in the Bay area"
bad,learning new apps and information on the mydevice - team leaders need improvement - co-workers some lazy others hard workers - enjoy seeing the friends I made
bad,"Target tends to show favoritism to those whom are deemed to be ""yes men"" versus those with an exceptional work ethic.  Growth and development tends to be more about if you are liked instead of being more qualified."
bad,At first the job was fun because i was in high school.Then shortly after graduating i realized that the pay wasn't great. Also Management wasn't mature enough to be management.
bad,"Don't learn much in any other departments besides your own. Long hours, low pay. Always busy, very repetitive. Made me never want to work retail again, had high turn around rate, employed longer than some managers."
bad,"The team members I worked with  were all great hard working people.  I worked early morning shifts and had to start pre-dawn hours with lots of perky people.  I enjoyed starting the day fresh so I was in charge of my personal work load.  I learned to use pda's, search on a specific computer system to find information, and work with different groups of people to complete tasks."
bad,every employee is very disposable after they need you for the season they just fire u with out any notification before hand when u go into work that day.
bad,I worked there while I was going to school. Best experience working during the holidays. It was pretty easy. very weird hours. Very little pay.
bad,Management here is either too strict and always on you or they arent around much. Coworkers are great though! Loved meeting all the different people and hearing their experience there. Hardest part is softlines had so much to do that we barely (if ever) finished! Management had poor organization and felt like they didnt know what they were doing!
bad,"Enjoy unloading the trucks and stocking merchandise on the shelves. Also working with blue prints setting new planograms such as Christmas, Valentines Day, Halloween. etc. Enjoying working with different team members."
bad,"I have worked at target for 5 years and have finally decided to leave because I can no longer work for people who continuously say one thing and do another. Management promises promotions to their team members but never promotes them but continues having them do the work of an assistant manager for free believing that they will eventually get promoted. I have seen this happen several times to co-workers who eventually realize what management is doing and are forced to quit because there is no room for growth. Also all the managers are males except for HR and the lead of the clothing area.The areas that get payed more are electronics, p fresh, backroom, and bike builders. All those jobs are offered to the male employees first and if they feel none of then are qualified then they ask the females. The claim its an equal opportunity work place but they don't give everyone a fair chance to apply. We don't know when openings are available and when there are they already have people in mind for them so there is no point."
bad,"i really did not enjoy working at target, management was bad and unprofessional, CO workers weren't really friendly, however it was something i was just doing temporary."
bad,Target has you come in whenever they feel like with an understaffed work team. Management is borderline incompetent and hypocritical in their criticism of entry level workers.
bad,"Target Distribution Center  Integrity Staffing  at Woodbury, MN is a good work place with easy job. However, there is no guarantee to get a 40 hours. I feel they hire people then would not consider the people expectation when they were told as before."
bad,Not much hours given. Slight opportunity for growth. Hardest part is the cleaning when working for food service department. No benefits less you are in management.
bad,"Didn't like it! You get hired full time. All that is said.  Then in orientation everything is explained about procedures, keeping up with your percentage.  Told us first mont was 50% expected, second month was 75% expected, then third month was 100% expected and proficient. Ok!  But when you go to do the work. On many occasions, the group leader would tell us we are expected to be at 100% by third week. Not third month.  Then he told us our full time status depended on if we get our percentage or not. Meaning lay off or fired if you didn't.  All this was not said in orientation or interview.  Ov time was advertised. Yea, sure, after 90 days and you have to sign up for it. Then it isn't guaranteed either.  No training on the RF Scanner. Taught how to log in and that was it.  The Stuart's draft, va target was not worth the $537 a week I made. I quit and went to where their was real money and better supervisors."
bad,The retail hours can be strenuous but there are great benefits. There is good opportunity to advance and grow within the company.
bad,"It's a good job but the management here weighs on you after a while. They live by their slogan ""expect more pay less"" even to their employees. :/"
bad,this job is based on having team members backs but from working there i didnt see no team work. i would request for help and nothing
bad,"Current situation is not good. Company is doing lot of layoff exercise "
bad,"A typical corporate giant with consistent events to help the community. The lack of follow-up, communication, and routines greatly limited effectiveness. But it's part time and this is typical American standard. If this was actually a part time job instead of my livelihood, I would not be quite so unhappy here."
bad,An ok work place with unsupportive management. ALL ABOUT THE NUMBERS and only about how you personally grow and develop if it is about the numbers. it would be better if there where more help and less stress.
bad,The culture of the store is changing to become overly stressful and less fun to work at stores. All leaders deal with stress while company goals increases and resources keep getting less. The teams and their well being is loosing steam.
bad,Fun people to work with. Management is terrible. No sympathy to others when time needed off. Very clique oriented. After 3 years only had a raise of $1.00. Don't plan on makin this anything more as a passing through job. The shoppers in the store are rude 80% of the time.
bad,"A lot of change happening, not a lot of empowerment, and limited promotional movement.  Workload has increased and still a lot of unknowns.  People are awesome!"
bad,"Decent compensation but you give up your soul. Career progression is based much more on politics than performance. As an ETL, you will work 50-60 hours on a good week so be prepared for that."
bad,"I have been at Target for 4 years and for the first 2 years it was a great job.  Hard work but the co workers were great, a real team mentality.  Management was supportive and engaged. Truly a great place to work and I looked forward to it every day.  Since the ""red card debacle"" it has gone steadily down hill.  Benefits cut, raises are a joke, really a joke.  Number of employees on each team cut drastically but the work load continues to increase by leaps and bounds.  Opportunities for advancement are almost non existent as Target is really only interested in people who are very young with no retail experience so they can be brainwashed into the Target way of doing things.  The only reason I have stayed as long as I have is the co works are some of the best people I have ever known. But the declining workings conditions have forced me to start looking elsewhere."
bad,"Most of the management didn't seem to care about you personally, but they did care about how you affected their bottom line.  They did not care about your paycheck amount.  They tried to get finish their work so, they could send you home early so, that they could get their bonuses."
bad,"I worked very hard at this company every day I worked. Management talks about staff being team members to help each other and work together, however they rarely send people help. You can expect to be talked down to."
bad,"The fellow team members were fun to work with, but management continuously burnt everybody out by forcing long and ridiculous hours at our already low pay. I had high hopes of advancing with this company, and was given false hope multiple times for various opportunities, for it to never come to fruition."
bad,"The people that you work with are great!!!! The management there is a joke!!!! There is no since of urgency and desire to get things done is almost nonexistent. Forget about getting 40 hours. It's more like 25 - 30 hours unless you are a team lead or management. benefits are a joke. Why? Because instead of getting the hours that you need to receive those benefits they keep you below 30 hours. They say that after you work there for a year you're entitled to paid vacation. Sure you do but you won't start earning that till after a year based on how many hours that you work. So for example, I worked there a year and checked to see how much vacation I had earned. Only earned a couple of hours of vacation at the fraction of my pay!!!"
bad,cake for your b day. easy task. big on speed score and pushing red cards that most don't want. only great for part time. long hours standing but you get 15 min break and 30 min lunch. not much advancement for cashiers
bad,"Your position isn't going to take you far in Target. Job is only good if management likes you. Even with a degree, it wont take you anywhere."
bad,Management is disorganized. If you ask the same question to 4 different leads you will get 4 different answers. The hours you get scheduled can decrease quickly without notice.
bad,I only worked there during the holiday season making nothing an hour. They could never get the hours I was able to work correct. When my boss went home for the day or wasn't there I sat in the bathroom or walked the mall.
bad,"You will learn how to work with a team on engaging, and selling. "
bad,they do NOT listen to suggestions from its employees and there are to many chiefs and not enough indians. Too early hrs and more people have quit from one person alone
bad,"Working for target is a nightmare. Most supervisors are inconsiderate and lack sympathy for employees. Target allows customers to mistreat employees, even when the employee is working efficiently, because ""the customer is always right"". They are not fair in their scheduling, favoritism is shown. I had a family emergency while at work and though the café was covered I was threatened with write ups if I left to tend to my family. I was scheduled to close alone during my training period, though a trainee is NEVER to work alone. Having to clean and close alone resulted in me clocking out an hour and a half behind my scheduled time. Instead of receiving pay for the time I worked my pay was cut to my correct clock out and I was written up for their mistake."
bad,"Get to work, and do your job in the greatest way they want. This is about how much they really expect. And it was kinda hard to do when we were heavily under staffed all of the time. Getting yelled at when I am working very hard everyday made me pretty mad. So this job got extremely stressful for me and almost all of my co workers. This was my first job and all but never has anyone ever treated my like they did for some seasonal work or anything."
bad,"A lot of work for one person. Management is not that good overall. But they do try. I think that target is unorganized but the people that work there are all very sociable and friendly, target can provide a good work environment."
bad,Associates are under appreciated. Good deeds go unnoticed. The company isn't sympathetic to injuries. Co-workers were fun to work with.
bad,I been working at target for over 9 years and u still make 9.89. The pay sucks . But I love the people I work with.Target I wish world just pay better
bad,"Did not enjoy my time here. let you work all you wanted your first six months, then they cut your hours down to about 12 a week if your part time. Had about 10 different bosses from the time I started until the time i quit."
bad,"not a good place to work as an adult, good first time job. I honestly think that they can offer more money especially for the amount of time one person puts in."
bad,Working here can be a bit of a drag sometimes. The upper management shows absolutely no consistency in their decision making. Their is a lot of favortism being displayed on work grounds. Co-workers run amuck sometimes. The best part about going to work is clocking out.
bad,An ideal workplace for students and older folks who would like to work part-time and limited days. not too much for advancement but the opportunity is there once in a while.
bad,"I learnd, that we assest my opportunities for the day and combinations of my supervisor opportunities  for me to do and we can prioritise the load out."
bad,The daily routine was well structured and kept me busy. My communication skills were refined during my time at Target and I learned how to properly engage in a conversation with customers. The management was very poor and not understanding but this is very common in a corporate setting. Co-workers were always very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was to finish all the duties on time. The flexible work hours were definitely the best part of the job.
bad,Was not a really structured environment when i worked there. Would not recommend someone there who was not young and in school.
bad,Very hard work at times.  Played around whenever we could.  Pretty good pay for the time.  4 day work week was cool.  Had a very nice covered deck with giant TV.  They would allow us to clock out and watch major sporting events in order to keep us from taking sick days when they came on.
bad,"Clock-in, work, break, work, lunch, work, clock-out. The job is great for understanding the processes that go into retail, but fails to create an environment, where employees can go and enjoy work.  But that aside the co-workers are fine. Unfortunately the management failed to represent the target brand, by being the opposite of what target's values are, (Fast, Fun, & Friendly).  Fortunately the lighting was good and created a better atmosphere than the constant overcast that is Washington weather."
bad,"this was my first job ever and it was seasonal so I got some good job experience working here. it was however, beyond stressful and very physically demanding. The staff was very hard to work with and very drama-filled. Management was very disorganized and awful at communication. Overall it was a very unprofessional environment and I would never want to work in that same position again."
bad,"a typical day at target requires you be able to do at least three jobs a day( stocker ,cleaner,casheir) you will be called to do all of these things every shift. the pay is minimum wage and raises will be about .12$ per year if you do a good job. the management style consists of etls who lead team leads who lead team members. the hardest part of the job i would say are the very hard hours worked during the holiday seasons and the lack of hours to work during the rest of the year."
bad,"Pretty much are treated as not very kindly.  Hours are not guaranteed, the more you make an hour the more your hours are reduced."
bad,"Best part of my job (I was in loss prevention) was interacting with my team and really helping them see the concept of shortage and how it impacts a store. Worst part is the company really talks about advancement opportunities but what it is instead is an dead end job. (I was ""promoted"" as a manager of my area, but a spot never opened up.)"
bad,"A fine place to work part time, but unless you are management, hours can be hard to come by.  There is no recognition for productivity. Someone who is a strong contributor gets the same hours as a weak contributor."
bad,"I enjoyed 13 of my 15 years with the company. The workload at one time was very manageable, till a few years ago. They added all these programs with no extra help and then started to cut payroll. The company went very money oriented and did not care about the workers like they did in the past. I would have recommended this company in the past work for, but now I would say do not even waste your time. Advancement opportunity is there to be an over payed team member, but to do anything with your career it is not. The policies they have in place are to help everyone, at the companies discretion. They always say put the right person in the right place, but headquarters puts all the wrong people place to run these stores. They do not care about commitment to the company, all they care about is micromanagement and who they can get in there to destroy morals of the stores. I used to see Bob ( Previous CEO) once a year. Since he left the company I have never seen a bigshot come in the store. My last store i had 5 store managers in 2 years, previous 13 years i had 5. The turnover rate is extremely high anymore and all the employees here is the company is not going in the right direction for them. I always lived by the motto "" If is is not broke, do not fix it "", Target was not broke, they were a striving company that was very good to work for, change CEO's and they company went to worse than a flea marketl. They went to fix something was was a perfectly oiled machine and in return  they have broken stores and miserable leaders as well as team members."
bad,Great place to work as long as you have no medical issues  and no needs outside of work.  I loved my job of unloading trailers .
bad,Terrible management. Horrible raises. Co workers are nice but management isn't realistic with the tasks that they give.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting guests in their shopping. I learned to walk and work with a sense of urgency.
bad,"This job over work me for very little pay.  I was given a list of things I needed to accomplish such as set sales planners, print signs, assist in ad prep, inventory make-up/ perfume, pull inventory from back if needed, in addition to keeping my area clean, ringing at the registers, helping customers, and assisting other employees as needed.  It is impossible to accomplish the first item off the list because there is never enough employees on the floor.  The staff is stretched so thin.  In my experience most of the staff is young and going to school, another portion is an older generation that is working to keep busy and the rest are people who do not have any other options."
bad,"I did complete this job review already, I apologies maybe I made an error and completed my review on one of my other jobs. "
bad,"Great pay, great hours, good benefits. Don't miss a deadline though!"
bad,"If $7.50 is a competitive wage then go for it. I made more starting at Wal-Mart in 2008. Oh and don't let the cart attendants quit or not show up because pushing carts becomes your job even though its not in your job description. I didn't like working for this company at all. Don't you or your children get sick either because ""Target base your future with them off your attendance"" This company is a complete joke"
bad,As a college student it is difficult to work go to school all day and then work until 11. I asked to be switched to a different department so I could have earlier shifts and was denied.
bad,"Worst management ever. If sara didn't like you, forget it. You are out. Early hours. supervisors cant make a schedule properly...very clique like work environment...worst place Ive ever worked at. never got a thank you"
bad,"Its long hours and never rewarding.."
bad,"I loved my team members, they became great friends."
bad,"Fast pace environment and office politics. Depending on your Store Manager, the training after being placed in a store is hit or miss."
bad,"Great people, but no interaction with anyone during your shifts. You're in a cold environment where you are not able to communicate with any of your co-workers. If you have an outgoing personality like myself and like to build relationships this is not the job for you."
bad,help customers with finding things in the store as well as cashing them out
bad,it was all in all a good and very refreshing experience working for target I and the skill they provide will help you progress in some aspects
bad,"There was no real training, just showed up and was thrown into everything. Guests were loyal and consistent and a joy to please but there was no time to adequately learn my job. The pharmacists were not patient with me as a new employee and was not compassionate to real life situations. I barely got 8 hrs a week sometimes and felt like I was being taken advantage of. It was a stressful environment being new and I was let go with my first real mistake!"
bad,"The over night flow team position is challenging for most people, The rules are constantly changing on a weekly sometimes daily basis for how management would like things done. I recommend anyone interested in working here consider working day side and not the over night shift."
bad,"worth gaining the experience."
bad,"helping customers at the register"
bad,It is definitely a fast-paced work environment and there is new information coming out all the time. I enjoy working with and helping people. Trying to get everything done in a day can prove challenging with work hours continually changing all the time.
bad,Extreme high turnover at headquarters compared to other organizations.
bad,"Most days I start at 4am and work until 1230pm"
bad,For young high schoolers or college looking for a job and in need of money
bad,I would come in at 0330 every morning. My team members were hardly on time and motivated to do their jobs. I learned that even grown adult individuals need to be closely supervised and coached. Management for the most part was effective. But they didn't look out for each other and I barely got any assistance disciplining my team for negligence. The hardest part of my job was making sure everyone was being productive and doing what they were tasked to do. They got sidetracked quite often and it kept the team from meeting their goals. The most enjoyable part of my day was when I went on break and when I clocked out to go home.
bad,"Hectic, Low pay, Poor management. If you don't any responsibilities and getting money isnt a goal for you the this company will be a good fit"
bad,"Very poor culture system, management consist of employees who have been there 15+ years which makes it very hard to advance up.  And lastly, the benefits are borderline insulting."
bad,"Long work hours, payed well  plus commission, Sales qoutas are easy to make"
bad,Working here and T-2137 has given me a different view of Target. The way that this operates is by far the worst ive ever seen in a company.
bad,"The first couple of weeks weren't too bad, training, getting used to the job. I had previous experience working in a warehouse, so I assumed this job would fit right in with what I was used to. The management seemed ok, nothing special, but then you start to listen to the coworkers tell there perspective about working with them. They say that she's mean, and that they would fire you for Anything! Shortly, I found that out the hard way. My last week with this company, I was given some of the busiest lanes, so I get to the lanes and there's broken items from the night before the people left for me, they didn't load very well, have to fix that, so the products coming down, broken items come down, take care of those, now my lanes are backed up, not much help from people because if you asked for help, well then maybe the job really wasn't for you. Mind you guys that have been there for a while, they would be talking amongst there other peers, while I'm busting my butt! The only thing that kept me working there was the pay, but for what its worth, it wasn't enough to deal with the stress, the labor, and the politics."
bad,"During store opening/ start up it was an amazing place to work. However, after they removed the night shift more then half of the employees left. This caused a huge gap in workers, which made everyone else's job absorb the missing roles. The people that stayed however, made the workplace amazing and gave us the willpower to go above and beyond our requirements. Management however still expected you to fulfil your quotas even when filling in for another department which could be the entire shift. Stress was definitely apart of the job however I do admit I loved the people and the job."
bad,Target is a  company to work for the benefits are good and the staff is consistent and friendly
bad,"Target is simply a large corporate retail company solely focused on overall revenue. I felt like there was little concern for employee satisfaction and they never gave any encouragement for promotion. The hierarchy scheme is too shallow as the ""point the finger down"" method of solving a problem was regularly used. Felt like a dog-eat-dog environment and the opportunity for advancement fell to those who obtained close friendships within the system. Compensation lacks as the relationship between that and responsibility is far off. The only position that pays well is the STL. Period."
bad,"it's not a terrible place to work, but it depends on which store you end up at. Management can make or break the store."
bad,"Target is a great company that will teach you everything you need to know about retail and leadership.  At times the workload is very high and requires long hours."
bad,"It's not too bad of a workplace, i just feel like I'm not making enough money for all the work that I do."
bad,"Not a terrible company, and i must say that i respect the values they promote on paper. However, your experience will vary significantly depending on where you are and who's supervising you. Like any retail position, there will always be pressure to get results. This pressure trickles right down the line and when the rubber meets the road, i found, that those fore mentioned values would often go right out the window. Moving up is not as easy as they make it out to be. Work life balance can be very hard to come by, especially during the holidays. If your in a good spot and you work hard you may find its the place for you. Personally, I hated the pressure to get results with limited resources and ultimately felt that i wasn't given the support needed to succeed."
bad,"Grab re-shop from guest services (re-shop is the merchandise that guests returned), bring it back to the fitting room to be sorted. Answer phone calls and assisting guests and team members while continually sorting through re-shop. Also re-packaging merchandise that is missing items or that has been defected in some sort of way. Towards the end of the shift you help out on the sales floor whether it be zoning departments (zoning is when you tidy up the departments like picking things off the floor), putting away re-shop, or helping guests. During the shift (this is a evening fitting room shift) you will educate guests on the new apps of Target and you will also be questioned about the apps weekly by managers. You will be expected to do things that you don't have enough people to complete and you will receive no praise for it."
bad,"Poor organization with little going for it."
bad,"Good quality products, nice customers and co-workers. Hours were horrible, management was rude. I quit this job!"
bad,"Management is often some new gradate with a degree in employee motivation, whw thinks that if s/he picks just the right music to play over the speakers, employee production will improve. Not a fan."
bad,If you don't fit in well they will let you go. thy play more to the side of the person that is a friend then a coworker trying to move up.
bad,Company committed to hiring fresh out of college with little to no experience.
bad,"When I first started working for Target I received no training . As time went on I realized that this wasn't the environment for me. Most Targets have a head cake decorator, and 1 or 2 backup decorators. Being the only decorator makes it difficult to keep up with orders, the freezer back stock program, and keeping the cake case full. Against the odds I have managed to do this, and I'm rewarded with them cutting hours to make payroll. There is no room for me to move up in the company in my field. This job really isn't worth the stress. I  dread coming to work. The only enjoyable part of my job is the people that I work with. Most of them are extremely nice people."
bad,Shift started at 10 pm with unloading of the truck and dragging pallets to store floor for stocking purposes.  Worked in every department including the electronics which had high security clearance because of value of merchandise.  Least favorite was the grocery department because high volume and pulling of older merchandise.  Liked working at nights without customers and the other stockers and supervisors were all great people.
bad,"Scanning items in the backroom to see if the product can fit on the shelves on the floor; scanning any overstock from the truck to the backroom and filling empty space in the backroom using a PDA. I also learned how to operate forklifts, in which they certified me for. My co-workers were nice to me and showed me the ropes. What I liked the most about this job was that I always stayed busy."
bad,"A typical day at work was very hard the work load was very burdensome, Management didn't really care for the employees they did give us the respect that we deserve and never thank us for a job well done. My co- workers was hard worker and we work together to make the work load easier. The hardest part of my job was the work load itself.  "
bad,I enjoy working hard and staying with a company for an extended amount of time. My co-workers become like family and we work together as a team. The management at Target lack experience in this type of work and therefore are very ineffective at the way things are handled and ran on a daily basis.
bad,target is a great corporation to work for but in order to advance or promote in anyway you must be in the managers group of already picked for advances favorites. all others who are not in the favorites category are given the least possible amount of hours possible. i do not see target as a fair business although i do enjoy the time i work there due to the fact that a lot of the coworkers keep a positive attitude and create an enjoyable space not only for team members but the guests as well.
bad,"It was a retail job. nothing fancy. You clock in, you put stuff on shelves, you put together displays, you solve problems fast and with a friendly attitude. "
bad,"Typing fast and and multi - tasking while taking calls, monitor calls,  the hardest part trying retain Target credit card."
bad,"I didn't like working here, the managers were too micromanaged. "
bad,"A typical day at this job was a top notch work out!  Constantly lifting and loading for 12hrs of the day. Dirty from head to toe, and they make sure they work every penny out of you that they are paying you."
bad,"this is just anyother job,, the usual. cashier working, stocking good customer service"
bad,A typical days work is busy and sometimes stressful.
bad,"I worked there for 5 years. The employees are not all treated equally. I worked in the backroom and was required to take on way to many tasks by myself with very little help from Management. The management was all very young and all had different views on the way things should be ran. The turnover rate was very high, I had 6 different direct managers in 5 years of working there, they all had different views of how things should be done, creating a horrible environment to work in. Nobody could ever get a good raise that was deserved. In fact the raises were all about a few cents, and only happened once a year. I could go on and on with cons but that would take to long.."
bad,Not enough staff. They emphasis more on the company not on peoples healthcare. Unreal expectations.
bad,"Hard work which is typical in retail management. Salary is slightly higher than other retail management positions. Job security is good, and so is career advancement. (although they lose a lot of good talent to their mandatory 18 month rule) Work life balance is terrible, they say min. 50 hr work week (no overtime) however you are frequently and strongly encouraged to work closer to 60-70 hr weeks consistently year round."
bad,"i needed to treat customers like guest and to value every detail of my job. make sure everything is perfect and give guest in attention that they need. help them to the best of your ability, and always deal with an angry customer in a professional manor."
bad,Management could learn how to manage better but the hard working co-workers make going in every night a bit easier.
bad,Do not wish to comment at this time. No room for improvement or upward mobility.
bad,less hours to work
bad,Assist customer credit accounts. Drive credit sales assist cashiers. I learned how to prioritize company objecives. Hardest part of the job was not making credit sales. The most enjoyable prt of the job was meeting company goals.
bad,was a good company until you refused to feed into their political agenda
bad,"waking up at 4 am to unload trucks, you can't leave until it is completed"
bad,Management was not the best and. Often worked long with very low raises. Gained a lot of experience in customer service
bad,it was an ok place to work but management was mean to everone.They was no job security if i were you i would not work there
bad,Typical Day at work evening and nights are very good steady to do the best we can speed is life to work actively and be proactive with our guests and giving them great service. my coworkers are very fun energic and upbeat hardest part of the job nothing much to say about that is though i love dealing with guests and making sure they are taken care the right way leaving them with great results and wanting to come back putting smiles on there faces brings great joy to me.
bad,"unload trucks,pull autos,back stock leftover merchandise."
bad,"The hardest part of the job...was pretty much everything. I managed the food section by myself with absolutely no help when necessary. When I finished closing food avenue, which took about 2 or 3 hours if you completed everything correctly, they would send me to different areas to help your coworkers. I would miss lunch breaks because no one would cover for me on time and supervisors blamed me for it. Not fun to work at."
bad,Taking care of the customers and making sure they were satisfied to gurantee return business.
bad,"They teach you the overall expected role of what a Great team it is to work for. They teach you to provide customer service above all else. In return,,,,its not felt the same way as an employee. You hire in with a schedule you need to stay on...and they put your working schedule totally opposite of what you hire in at. You learn great customer service qualities and you learn a lot of knowledge of how a store sells merchandise but far as being felt like you belong or on the same level,,,,the stores I worked at...the supervisors acted like they were too high and mighty."
bad,Employee safety not a priority. Very few opportunities for advancement. Low pay with very little improvement. Management not very strong.
bad,"The management talks a good game. The problem with target, poor management practices. The employees are treated very bad. Employees really need a union. This is hard for me to say, because for years I was anti-union until I worked for target. Now I see a union is needed at target. My advise is work there, get your experience and leave. The warehouse I worked at has a roving door people in and out at a constant rate."
bad,"Started off great, everyone was friendly and work was fairly simple. However, in my particular store, it was a big high school gossip environment. Leads noticeably had favorites, and the store manager really didn’t care what current tasks you had. They would pile on work, specially to the hard-workers, making it impossible to finish previous work. For the pay it was bare-able but management has a lot to work on."
bad,"My first year-and-a-half or so went extremely well, until the nearest Target location closed down. We then had to bring a great deal of the staff into our building, which cut hours dramatically. When I started I had recieved 32-39.5 hours a week, and by the time I left I was recieving only 12-28 hours (frequently spread over 5 or 6 days a week). Many people ened up walking out, including much of the management."
bad,"at first evrything was good but as time passed people started to be more rude and it was not a fun place to work. the superpervisors were not helpful, no in-store promotion."
bad,"I like to say that I’m a pretty creative person. This job wasn’t horrible at all, it actually paid very well and for someone who can handle a repetitive work environment, this is great for you. The only problem that I have with this job is that I wasn’t seeing any progress with anything. It was the same thing every day, and it really sucked."
bad,"When I worked there I got sick and they were insensitive to my situation and basically fired me because the doctors couldn’t figure out how to diagnose me right away. The management was already poorly functioning, though the people who were there longer acted like they were better than you. It was a nice job over all a typical day besides the management was a fun job, nice cafeteria  food."
bad,"The job itself isn’t hard. People there are nice and you make friends. Management overall is inconsistent and they expect a lot out of you in a short amount of time. Hours are inconsistent as well and depending on location, they do not work with other priorities that you have outside of work, For example second jobs or school ."
bad,"A typical day at Target is fast- paced, busy, and never dull. My coworkers were my favorite part about working here because they were friendly and helpful. There was always plenty of work to be done so I was always busy doing something if I wasn't helping customers. The break room always had snacks which wad nice. Overall a good experience."
bad,Perfect for life and work balances. Management cares for every team member. And the guest is the driving force on which the store operates. Be prepared for a lot of guest interaction
bad,"If you’re considering working here then you should be ready to have ALOT of coworkers. That means that leaders (aka managers) have ALOT to deal with. So just be ready to be do you! If you’re looking for a place where people appreciate and notice the good things you do to improve, don’t look here! your odds of ending up with a helpful/attentive Supervisor is slim to none!"
bad,I enjoyed working there but they tend to terminate jobs way to easy and for no reason at all. The people were great coworkers but the managment seemed confused about numbers of shipment at times.
bad,Lack of cultural inclusion. Management lacks key leadership skills. Efficiency is not valued. Tops down approach leads to lack of understanding of purpose at management level.
bad,"They pay $12.00 to $15.00dollars an hour, but they cut the hours down to 5 to 10 hours a week. Pointless. They  want you to work and give them 150% while they give you 40. Very much for the money."
bad,You get payed very well for only having to be there for 3 days a week. The only problem is that this job in any department is so boring you do one thing all  day with no movement. The only thing that got me working here longer is that they payed great and you get payed every week. Other then that I would not recommend to people who want a fulfillment out of there career. Definitely a job you go to if you want to get in and out and not build a relationship with your coworkers.
bad,"Typically, a normal day involves helping out my team in any way I can; whether it is replacing products or helping out my fellow team members when they need it.  I have learned how to keep calm in stressful times and enhance my customer service capabilities.  One of the bad things about working in the store that I do is the management team that I have to answer too.  Most have either the inexperience to lead or lead by ""flexing their muscle"" when it is unnecessary.  Because of the management team, the moral of the team is incredibly low and is getting worse."
bad,"While the pay compared to other retail competitors is actually pretty good, (at least in my state) the work culture can be pretty ridiculous, especially in management. There's this sense of cultist behavior like Target is life. This also applies to moving up. It doesn't matter much if you do your job well. You really just need to brown nose your way to management. I have known co-workers who were rejected management positions because the managers didn't like them or they didn't brown nose, even though they were the best performers in their area of work. It truly feels like they drank the Target Kool-aid. Also, in the last couple of years, there have been a few changes that just don't make sense at least in the store I worked at. The technology and software we work with also can be very frustrating. It feels like it went through minimal testing, if any at all. Another thing, whenever there was a product reset, we were never prepared. There was always product that we were missing. The raise system was also left wanting. We got a raise once every year and it was negligible at best. They also didn't treat employees well pay wise who stayed there for a long time. For example, I started at started wages and I ended at starting wages (technically speaking). I have worked at Target for over 8 years and I stayed at the same level as people just starting."
bad,"I'm a seasonal fulfillment associate. It's a physically demanding job, but I don't mind that at all. The managers, ""team leads"" are awful though.  I mean, really, terrible. I've never worked a job where I was trained for 3 days and then sent off on my own and expected to do work like a seasoned employee. For some reason the manager constantly talks down to us and acts like were incompetent children. I actually enjoy the work and would consider staying after the holidays, but I don't think I could stand to work with such unhelpful, unkind management. My coworkers and other employees around the store have been great though! Target has an awesome team of employees that work hard and keep an upbeat, friendly attitude despite the holiday stress."
bad,"I worked nights and days, they were flexible and generous with hours. Not the most friendly environment but everybody did their job but everybody kept to themselves"
bad,"The management team at Target continually scheduled me for far more hours than I asked for. When I requested less, they refused, saying that they were understaffed. I'm sorry, but it isn't my problem that no one wants to work at that location. I should not be required to work 40+ hours when I am a full time student and only requested 10-20 max on my application."
bad,"I've worked in retail my entire life, however Target doesn't seem to fit the same mold. The management in this specific location were young, they were all old friends, and the banded together to form cliques. When they wanted someone out, they made sure to get them out. It was an uncomfortable atmosphere from almost the very beginning. As an outsider coming in, good luck."
bad,"They pay well enough, coworkers are awesome. Management doesn’t know what they are doing however and often made the job more stressful then it needed to be. Management also had issues blaming associates for anything that goes wrong."
bad,"Toxic. Tory is the most bi polar girl you’ll ever meet. Managers will make your job here a living nightmare. Apply with caution. The pay is fine, but the stress is immense."
bad,"Was good if you need the money. People were cool and fun to work with, the job was basic and it overall wasn’t terrible. Only had issue with management and how the store ran sometimes but you get over it."
bad,"I went into the job a couple months ago, liking it. It was fun, paid real well for my area & was upbeat. Didn’t take long for me to realize all the bashing that Target gets from employees were true. My TL was a bully. She constantly threatened us, lied on us, told us false information that could’ve gotten us fired, she physically assaulted a co worker of mine off camera view, we’ve all complained on her to no avail. HR didn’t care about any of us, I got tired of my TL getting mad at me for something petty and then cutting my hours. I quit. It’s a nice job at first, but you’ll get done dirty."
bad,"Target markets itself as a woke, inclusive, diverse company but it has some serious waking up to do. In order to access the employee discount, you need to qualify for the Red Card, which prohibits many poor people(who may have bad credit) from accessing the employee discount. Without the Red Card you cannot take advantage of 15% savings, so its a form of red-lining the poor(no pun intended). I've never had issues accessing an employee discount even when I worked at Saks Off 5th back in the day.  They're inclusive where it involves race or disability, but not economic diversity. Its bad enough we're paid barely above min wage in CO. If you're paying so little, might as well allow people to access your product. Quit being cheap and stingy!"
bad,Managers at the company are selfish and have no real concern for their employees. I was being scheduled closing shifts one day then opening the next. I have never been scheduled a full 40 hours per week. They make you do other department's tasks instead of your own. Operates like a warehouse. Maybe a better atmosphere at different locations.
bad,"When I worked at Target Brea for seasonal, I was the first one there. I wasn’t taught how to do anything until three months in after I made all the mistakes. The whole time I was there I asked questions, trial and error, coworkers helped me. However I was always the scapegoat as I was new and everyone assumed I knew how to do things very quickly even though I was doing four things at once(backup cashier, fitting room, mens and go backs). I was overworked and everyone thought I was lazy when in reality I was too tired to keep going."
bad,"The coworkers are nice but not enough time to complete the tasks given in a day.  They expect too much out of people.  The goals and amount of work is unrealistic they continuously take more departments away and expect other departments to pick up the work with out extra hours to do the work or extra people.  they shut the pricing department down.  stopped having a person at the fitting room.  Stopped having a flow team and gave the extra tasks to the soft line department, expecting them to do the extra work and their own. While backing up the front end checking people out and answering the telephone."
bad,"It was a fast-paced environment. Always on the run. Fulfillment is different from store to store. They expect for you to also stock and reach/bring merchandise from the back room to customers. If you have a disability, I won't recommend working there. Too many tasks and limited time to complete them. Management don't know how to handle disabled workers. If you get sick, you might get fired."
bad,"Coming from someone who has spent just a month short of 2 years at Target, it's gone downhill fast. Team Leads don't communicate/communicate enough, my own hours were considerably less (from 35-40 down to 15 a week), and Team Leads created a lot of stress that wasnt present before."
bad,Working at Target was ok to me because all it is to me is doing chores and it was easy. Also the truck unload part could be a bit ridiculous but as you soon it gets done be unloaded then everything went will.
bad,"*I've only worked here for 2 months* Started as a pretty relaxed and nice place to work - for about 2 weeks. Unfortunately, they created new time goals that are un-realistic. Of the 4 General Merchandisers who started within the week I did; I'm the only one remaining. Furthermore, at-least 2 General Merchandisers who've worked there for over a year have recently quit. (Without even putting in their two weeks) Everyone there who made the work environment bearable are leaving, and i plan to soon follow. It's a shame too, because it has pretty great pay for the job, but the managers and team-leads just heckle you all day about your time goals. (For example, i pride myself as being a pretty hard worker, but when placing a cart worth of objects is supposed to take me 15-30 minutes, but actually takes upwards of 2.5-3 hours; there's not much you can do) I would not recommend working here, or not as a General Merchandiser at least. I don't know how the other stores handle the new time goals, but my store was number one in its specific district, so i imagine it can't be much different elsewhere."
bad,"Nice place to work but there is a lot of gossip and anything or anyone can jeopardize your job. Lots of team leader positions, paid the same, but some have more to lose than others."
bad,"It’s was good at first, then it became inconsistent. My management team as good but sometimes the inconsistency would be a pain. Cut hours weekly, no advancement."
bad,"Hours are not set but the people are alright Why do I have to do this? I just want to apply for a job. It's an okay place to work. I don't know what else to say, so peace."
bad,Working for Target was better when I first started years ago. Not sure if it depends on what target you work for but the one I work for is really unpleasant due to some management. It’s great pay and great retail experience but the management ruins it.
bad,"Lied about pay, made you do to much for not enough money, cut your hours without telling u way, made sure people that were working there before gets more hours then you. Terrible job"
bad,"Management is okay, but I got lots of “documented conversations” based on rules I never had been told existed as well as a superior lying about me having headphones in. My training was one day, and the girl didn’t even know she was training me or that I’d been hired. After that it was 5-8hr shifts by myself. At times it felt like they wanted to fire me and were just trying to make it easier for themselves to do so. It’s retail, but on the more high school-side. The pay is good but they don’t offer full time or benefits. Maybe a different target location would’ve been best."
bad,"Pay was decent. Not worth it if you take into account the horrible managers, and overall culture they've made. Not to mention the highly unsanitary restrooms."
bad,The job itself is cool.I love interacting with guests but the main issue is the management. We cant seem to keep a manager long enough to keep the store afloat.
bad,I might quit. They really expect a lot from you and give you virtually no training so personally I feel like a failure after every shift because I have no idea what I'm doing. I've never quit a job before (at least not because I just didn't like it) but it's getting really tough. I think if you had previous retail experience you would probably love it.
bad,"I took a job as a part-time employee. Pay is good ($13/hr), and work culture is decent. The main problem I experience is the disconnect between corporate objectives and local, store-level needs. Communication does not seem to be a primary concern between various levels of the company hierarchy. Team leaders who toe the company line and disregard team member needs will thrive, which makes working for Target all the more stressful."
bad,"When I first applied there I was really excited , then sooner or later as I kept working the employees (managers) will treat you bad and you have to work around their hours when it clearly stated that they will work around your hours , the pay is semi okay , it’s just all about favoritism which is horrible  because this isn’t High school anymore ."
bad,"I've learned a lot from this company, but since modernization, I feel extremely unhappy with management. They are constantly watching your every move, and while it pays above minimum wage, they treat it more like you're making $50 an hour. "
bad,"There are a lot of unspoken rules that you need to know unfortunately they aren't told to you upfront. Sometimes you find out about necessary information by ""trail and error"". Make sure you ask the employees in your department how things are done."
bad,"Management not caring.  There were some good workers at Target. co-worker who cared about Target. Management cared about themselves,  there was no work life balance ."
bad,Really bad there are never enough hours and the management sucks if you do something they don’t like they will cut your hours just because they don’t like you.
bad,Coworkers are all amazing. But we were constantly over worked on the edge of mental breakdowns. We would get threatened over the tiniest of things. And anyone that ever showed interest in wanting to move up was incredibly overworked and made to feel bad if they ever made a small mistake.
bad,when i first started at target it was good hours were good everything was good. nowadays its very hard to get hrs good enough to be able to pay any bills you may have.
bad,"Typical work day would include pushing carts, cashiering, pulling items in the backroom to be stocked on the sales floor. It's a retail job, I didn't expect it to be a lifetime job, just something to get me through."
bad,Was not the best place to work-Work/Life management was horrible. The management team was more focused on sales and profit and less on development and career advancement.
bad,"Unorganized and plays favorites, but friendly coworkers if you find the right ones. I wouldn't work here again but that's just my experience. Good luck!"
bad,"Started working for the company in 2015 right before they went from minimum wage to 9/hour and it wasnt bad for a retail job. Soon, after countless changes in management and a major change in leadership, everything just spiraled. The company culture as whole is toxic. The hotline to report ethical missteps is a complete joke. Says that the hotline is anonymous but they give the phone number of the team member who called to the store's HR rep so good luck if you use your own phone. Overall, just a toxic place to work now and its a shame because it wasnt always that way and the only reason to stay is because of the decent hourly wage. It traps you, especially if youre in a town with very little in terms of jobs with competitive wages."
bad,"I was never scheduled and when I did call out very rarely, I was criticized. I eventually quit after the communication became so poor at my location. So much gossip and assumptions between higher up leaders and never asking the lower positioned people what actually happened."
bad,If you’re not kissing the managements behind you’ll definitely pay for it in the end. Super unprofessional management. Hours are not flexible at all. No chance to advance in the company what so ever. Would not recommend working here.
bad,"My hours were shortened when I asked for my benefits.  I was not properly trained in other positions for which I was required to work.  I was hired as a cashier, but asked to perform other duties for which there was no training, I was held accountable for performing those duties just as if I had been hired and trained for them.  I enjoyed my customers and co-workers.  I took pride in my work and wished they had appreciated me more."
bad,"it was a nice starting job but i wouldn't make working for target a career , its a lot of lack of communication, misunderstandings, managers don't intend to help  with the team members . they would rather sit in the office and talk all day, or walk the floor on their phones. the work asked can be very stressful , its not hard if you really put your mind to it. its still a good job to start off with just not a job you would want to stay at forever."
bad,Most of the time you have to do more of a work load than intended. Ask too much of you in the small amount of hours you have in a day with no help.The management id absolutely no help unless you fall into one of they're favorite spots.
bad,"What's great: good pay, benefits, really fun co-workers who are great all around people"
bad,"I love most of the team members I worked with.  There were a few members of management that I would've followed to other stores.  However, when HR plus me into the office to tell me I'm getting a raise, and then one month later they tell me I'm going to be making the same as a new employee (event though I have 4 more years of experience), that really burned me.  Watching poor employees make the same as those who worked hard was awful.  Watching employees come in late (even 30 min or more) and keep their job really made me mad.  Don't even bother trying to advance to management.  Unless you're ""in"" with the other managers, or they're in desperate need of a low level manager, you don't stand a chance.  They'll drag you along as long as they can and dangle that ""promotion"" in front of you to keep you there.  Upper management could've cared less about the team members at Starbucks.  Long hours (4+) often by yourself during peak seasons was common.  Getting yelled at by customers for things out of your control was common, and then having management yell at you for not taking breaks was just the worst.  Then, having a team member call in and ""not being able to find coverage"" was common, then followed by them wanting you to cut your own hours so they didn't have to pay you over time."
bad,"Target in General I feel is a great company to work for . My store specifically, is a hot mess . To the point where people will start today and walkout and never come back . My Leads & Leaders do not set employees up for success, & do not lead by example . They expect you to be a robot and complete an 8hr+ workload on a 5hr shift . If not, its “coachings” . Management leaves for hours . Just horrible . HORRIBLE"
bad,"While I initially enjoyed working at Target for the first year, the higher ups at corporate decided to change how management ran and I know longer enjoy working for them. The people they also employed were initially okay and fun to work with until people started dating around and spreading rumors for the sake of who knows what."
bad,Someone who did the least amount of work and constantly had complaints was given the most hours consistently. As well as all the new changes with the departments.
bad,"I’ve asked several times to be transferred to a different part of the store but they refuse. Even when there are jobs available. They also do not care about their employees, it seems like they only care about money. The managers show favoritism and sometimes completely ignore the days people say they can’t work and schedule them anyway."
bad,"Some of the team leads here cared more about how many credit cards you got then the workers themselves and would be so fake as in caring what you have to say when really they just want more credit cards and all the changes they’re making are worse instead of better, and begging someone who is leaving to stay says even more about how this work environment is, not worth the pay"
bad,don't have an emergency within the first 90 days. You will lose your job. The people are nice and the pay is good. I didn't mind working there at all.
bad,"As a customer, I was inspired to work for Target due to the cool management but when I finally landed a job there, but the management had changed. The management I liked were headed to other stores and the new management did not communicate with the other managers and it was just so disorderly and unprofessional they were not on the same page and they treated employees quite rudely. I found a better job and left in a heart beat. I just hope they got themselves together, but I will never go back."
bad,"the expectations of each team member has more than doubled, despite the average shift being less than 8 hours and not having enough hours by the end of the month to even finish a truck. we are expected to complete several tasks in less than 6 hours, including stocking an entire area while maneuvering around guests during store peak hours. we are also expected to back up cashier when needed, taking more time away from our already long list of tasks."
bad,You are worked really hard and if you need to take time off they will ask you to work around your issue and still come in. If you can't work with them or doesn't work for them then you'll be written up and told to work harder.
bad,Target is a friendly place to work for the most part. It can be stressful during certain time of the year. The pay can definitely be better. I felt like there was no room for promotions.
bad,They managers don’t like to work around your schedule when you have a child. I was only working nights and getting of at 11:30 at night and only working 2 days a week for like 5 or 6 hours. When payday came my check use to be like 90 to 150 every two week that’s not enough money when you have a child to take care of .
bad,Target isn't a bad place to work the hours are very flexible so ig you want to have a second job or go to school you can do so without too much hassle.
bad,"Target OPS requires a large time commitment and it's hard to feel like  you accomplish much despite long hours. IT systems and reporting are not easy to use, and with no hourly leadership roles salaried management must invest many hours to ensure teams stay productive.  Visits from HQ staff occur quarterly, do not add value, and disrupt the operations with excessive prep. Hourly and most salaried employees are engaged."
bad,"Ok management.. The Target i worked for, it was harassment Day 1, I got looked down upon before I started my shift. No matter how hard I worked they would always find something wrong with the work even when I told them at the start that I had ADHD, With that information.. They then trained me for 2 days expecting me to know everything.. If you are a person who knows everything you will grow within target, if not then they will harass you about your disability and the way you work, and overload you with tasks that should have been done. This company is great for consumers, but the target in Westboro needs some courses to make the environment better. Dont go here expecting great people its all a lie. They prejudged me before I got in, I worked my butt off, and after 3 months of hard work, they let me go because it wasnt good enough."
bad,"(2701 Lawndale Dr, Greensboro, NC 27408) The company could run a lot better if it was under better management that have respect for their team members. You are just another number in this store and if you cant hop up and work when they need you unnoticed, you are no value to them."
bad,"I started off as a team member and one of my supervisors helped me move up to become a team lead after two and a half years. I loved being here and my team for the first four years with the company. However, at this point I am constantly unable to focus and plan out my own work because I am constantly helping out in other departments that are struggling. I am stressed out beyond belief, in and out of work. I absolutely dread going in every day due to the fact that I am bombarded with drama as soon as I walk in. Once you learn certain skills (such as Inventory,  covering breaks, or cross training) the management will take advantage of you and expect you to help when there is a call out. "
bad,"come into work already behind from the night before. Check all perishable product before the store opened to make sure no expired product on the sales floor.Never had time to talk to to many people either on the sales floor or in the backroom. Management didn't understand that I was a team lead, and still reprimand me for the employs not getting a job done."
bad,"Decent place to work, management is a mess. Wage is okay, overall not great. Target preaches that they're a family company but when working there it's apparent that they don't care about workers and their families"
bad,"Working at Target is similar to working at most retail positions. There is a high demand on working quickly (""with a sense of urgency"") that often is promoted over accurate or fulfilling work. Like most retail, you will be left feeling like you are a cog in the machine. However, immediate leadership does their best to look out for you."
bad,"With the recent push to increase the hourly pay, Target has now made it $13/hr. That generally would be good, but the few hours a store has to give all of it's employees means a lot of us are working 10 - 20 hours a week. I need to maintain two jobs because Target wasn't enough to make end's meet. As someone in Hardlines, they toss you around different departments of the store, some with even worse hour availability."
bad,"ok, not really much advancement or pay. Job duties are pretty much the same every day, not enough pay for some of the stuff they have you doing especially unloading trucks"
bad,Most of the employees are messy. The managers are showing favoritism to the crooked employees and fire good employers. The experience is good but the Management is super terrible.
bad,"Work at Target, for an hourly employee, isn't particularly great. The inconsistencies in procedure will start to frustrate you very quickly. Management is hardly ever well chosen or selected from within, and usually consists of inexperienced college graduates. "
bad,"The managers don't communicate with any of their employees in terms of advancement. No meetings or even a mention of advancement unless they like you. Play favorites with some employees even though they say they don't. If you're looking for a place for advancement or reliable hours, look elsewhere."
bad,"-Hours vary greatly you can go from working 40 hours with overtime to working 4-12 hours a week for several months."
bad,Plantation Life Here NO RESPECT They want you to work fast and time you but times should not be the same for all stores. Management cant help you all they call tell you is to work faster
bad,"When I started working here it was  a hard working enviroment but fun at times. Lost  good managers that moved on to other stores or new jobs. I lost trust in management and favoritism that is out of control. Benefits are the best, but you have to be full time to get most benefits its hard to get time off."
bad,"never really worked with any one, was on contract to do deliverys and it was the same each week and no other adds or minuses to this job. same thing every week"
bad,"I worked at Target seasonally as a hardlines tm. For the work, the pay wasnt too bad, but other than that the job sucked. I don't know about other locations, but the suprevisors, or STLs as they like to be called, were the worst workers of all. For the sheer amount of them there were, almost none of them did their jobs and instead passed off work to lower employees, even at high times you could often find an stl walking around doing nothing or sitting in an office while delgating work to others. There was also inconsistent portrayal of the rules, depending on the day and which stl was in charge, I wouldnt even get my proper breaks. I also never receieved all proper training and was forced to teach myself many aspects of the job and overall the organization of the store was horrible, with work schedules not even being properly recorded. Leadership is mediocre at best and you should expect to be taken advantage of if you work here. If there was adequate leadership, I feel the environment would be much better to work in, but I doubt that will change."
bad,"Communication from upper levels not given in a timely or consistent manner, resulting in scattered focuses and a lack of common priority at the store level."
bad,The company seems to make unsmart business decisions and then blame managment for failing. Managment can be extrememly lazy and lack empathy. Benefits are decent
bad,"Management team was a boys club where promotion was only available to people who were a part of the in crowd. No amount of effort would allow you to advance past a certain point. I trained several college interns that were later hired far above me. I made the mistake of staying with Target for far too long after multiple suggestions of advancement only to be left on the bench waiting."
bad,Fun and fast place to work. Great guests who shop in the stores. Leadership does not do well in communication. Great benefits in a management position.
bad,"The job itself can be rough at first. Getting proper training on all of your tasks is not provided and must be learned first hand. Day time Team leader is incapable of teaching new people, learning new things and cannot communicate properly. After that, the job is easy. Once you self taught yourself about your job, getting into a quick and effective pace is easy and rewarding."
bad,"Revolving door when comes to supervisors and managers."
bad,"The customers are better than the employees . I was seasonal cashier at towson target  in maryland . It was great up until I started speaking up for myself to management. I would do doubles, I was always on time, I would stay late come in on my off day. I even would help in other departments like hardline. I did everything that was ask of me plus more . One day I was super worn out and I had to close as a cashier . I let my manager or LOD as they call it know that I had. Headache and just had did a double and I just wanted to stay on cashier  for the remainder of my shift she had no sympathy of how over work I was she still wanted me to do hardlines even though my assignment was just strictly cashier. She took advantage of my help I would extend to hardlines and over work me more that day despite me not feeling well even when I asked her was it optional or mandatory . She said it was optional But still made me do the work. I completed the task and still days after did as I was asked. Season was over and I was still being schedule I asked how my position because I was still being schedule to close the store and always open I worked super hard I just knew they would keep me. However when I asked that same manager brought up that one day and said that’s why I wasn’t picked up and then another manager lied and said I was “always going back and forth with her” and I wasn’t what they was looking for .  The back and forth the manager was referring to was me checking in with her making sure my time card and everything else was accurate because she said I had been late and the times"
bad,"I was hired by the initial rx mgr. She left to be a regional person, and left me with an awful man who doesn't even like people, much less be empathetic that they are sick, ill, or disabled. Then they decided to get rid of whomever made the most money, who had been there the longest."
bad,I used to love coming to work and felt appreciated and valued there now not so much. The changes that have been made to the logistical part of the store is going in the wrong direction
bad,"Employers are very nice and genuine, and very few managers are realistic about what's obtainable. Some managers act like team members are able to finish a certain task in under ten minutes but they never think about how guest ask for help."
bad,"While the pay at Target was great (higher than average starting pay for recent college grads), the working conditions are stressful. The hours are long, especially during the busy holiday season. Expectations from corporate and district/regional management are unrealistic."
bad,"A typical day at work is you're thrown onto a lane and you take guests for about two hours or so.  You will get super stress-inducing guests but also a pep talk about getting Redcards.  After that, you get a fifteen minute break (sometimes a late or early break) where you get to relax at the cafe.  Afterwards, though, you are thrown right back onto the lanes to take more guests and serving them with a smile."
bad,this place sucks by all standards it is not a good place to work simply because of the store managment it lacks everything a store needs to succeed and is the downfall of any major retail store.
bad,"I worked here for five years and during this time was in a bad car accident. I brought a note in from my chiropractor and everything and asked for the (probably) 100th time to be moved from register to the sales floor and was lied to or got poor excuses from the supervisors and was merely moved to self check out where I went through a lot more stress and pain from my injuries. Soon after, my hours got cut drastically and I was treated like an outcast."
bad,Need something that cares more about them. Stressful. The change is not working for the store. There is not enough hour even with the holiday. The stl is new. He doesn't take the time to work with each group to fix the issue.
bad,"I have worked at target for over a year and I have wanted to quit for most of that time but I was afraid of not finding a career that suits me because of the education I currently have and what I still need. I wouldn't recommend working at Target in Tulsa Hills. I cannot speak for any other Target establishment. Management, depending on who is there, can be great or terrible. Some GSA's can be fast and kept up while others slack and don't pay enough attention."
bad,"As a Team Lead and Visual Merchandiser, I dislocated my shoulder while on the clock at Target. I was denied any form of compensation or disability, using my medical conditions against me. They claim to have this great family atmosphere and to care for their employees, but this is a lie. This was the second time I had worked for this company and gotten injured on the job (first time had a shelf fall in the back room and dislocated my knee, the second occasion was taking shelves to the trailer during a remodel during a storm and dislocated my shoulder when slipped.) After dedicating 5 years total to this company, there is no appreciation and no value to their employees. You are viewed as replaceable and on many occasions will be told so if you show any form of discontent for your job."
bad,"Over the five years I stuck around I was the last one standing. "
bad,Please consider all of your options before applying because when I first got the job I was excited but as soon as the leads and supervisors greet you it was all down hill from there not a fun place to work
bad,"the people are great to work with, but the work enviroment isnt the greatest with limited hours. money hungrey company as a whole. dont have nothing ."
bad,Target likes to make changes even if it's not beneficial. A day at target is more like a chore because they expect more than what they give you. The only thing I like about target is the people you meet and the job is not hard just sometimes unfair.
bad,I always felt on edge working a shift at Target. I was always worried something would happen. A typical day at work just meant helping customers check out.
bad,"I started out at Target as a seasonal cashier. I enjoyed the employees, the environment, and the hourly wages. I was excited to hear that the store had decided to keep me around once the season was complete."
bad,Enjoyed the culture of asset protection. The people were great but the pay was less than standard. Received a percentage off of items. The work schedule was consistent.
bad,"I worked as a cashier at Target and absolutely hated it. My managers (or GSA's) were always focused on making the Redcard goal, which is good, but they threatened to fire me if I didn't sign someone up in the first month that I worked. They continued to threaten me with termination if I would be lacking in the Redcard department. They also had favorite employees and it was obvious that you weren't one of their favorites. Training was brief and not very helpful. I read a pamphlet and then did 20 minutes of practice before I was put on a register alone. If you are scheduled for part time, they will schedule you for 5hr and 55min so they don't have to give you a full lunch too and often go on break late because they forget.  Also, you need to let them know a solid two months before you need time off otherwise they won't give it to you. I requested to have my high school graduation off and it was denied. Overall, I would look elsewhere if you're looking for part-time. Management always had bad attitudes, the scheduling is not flexible, and probably one of the most stressful environments I've ever been in."
bad,"Liked the employees I  worked with. Target was suppose to be fast, fun and friendly. They only wanted us to be fast. They have a lot of turnovers in our department."
bad,"clock in and begin to move trailers within the yard according to the distribution center and their needs"
bad,"I like the company's culture, but the hours are not enough. Also, there is no chance for growth. The work hours are flexible, but not enough for living. I wish I can find a job with my college degree."
bad,This company micromanages everything.  Everything has a process and all processes are measured.  It is literally the tail that wags the dog.  Everything is about execution at store level - check your brain at the door and do it.
bad,"Was a good place when I started but has gone downhill. Management cares too much about trying to push redcards and up sell every single breathing creature that enters the building. They also very heavily play favorites and if you make them mad they cut your hours into oblivion. There is no part time/full time, its just what ever hours they give you. I would get 8 one week then 30 the next, but never close to 40 they won't give you OT and will send you home when you get close to 40. I loved the people I worked with though, everyone was super nice and people who weren't nice or team players were let go pretty quick. Job itself was simple enough, fast paced and changed day to day. I enjoyed the actual work and being able to run around all day. Then they started to cut positions and put more work on us, expecting us to do the job of 3 other positions as well as our own. Expect more work, get paid less."
bad,i enjoy the people i work with and the starting pay is better than other retail places. schedule flexible at times and then not in others your availability is not really considered. alot of work to be done in a short amount of time. team leads are all above themselves.
bad,"At first the job was great, good pay and hours ranging from 30-40 per week. After about 4 months my hours were cut to below 20 without warning or seemingly any reason at all. They refused to give me more hours forcing me to find a second job. After being hired at the second place I handed in a new availability at target and was told I either needed to open up more days or quit (I had 4 days completely open for them because my second job required me to work fri, sat, sun). A typical work day included being told to zone and scan 30+ isles in less than 2 hours, work out 8 flats with at least 15 boxes on each flat within a 6  hour shift all while responding to cashier or carry out back-ups, helping customers, and trying to fit in your breaks for the day. Management was horrible, criticized hard working employees while praising the work of employees who stood around on their phone for their entire shift, threatened termination to certain employees who were on their phone while in the break room, the scheduling managers would yell at employees for not having enough workers even though they were the ones to blame for being understaffed, certain managers would show up drunk or hungover, one would actually sit in their office not answering phone calls or responding to anyone who called out for them. Overall just a very poor workplace environment. There were many days where I cried or sat in the bathroom because of panic attacks. No employee benefits even to those who had been working there for 2+ years. Would not recommend this job to ANYONE."
bad,"Other targets may be more pleasant but the wake forest, NC store is not. Worked at this target for nearly 9 months cause I didn’t have another option. The management is awful. The pay seems worth it till they have you running around like a chicken with your head cut off. Getting yelled at, while (most) of management is just chit chatting amongst themselves. When most all of the time, there were not enough people on the schedule, especially for how huge the store is. Fine in the beginning, but began to dread going in. The only bearable thing was the people I met, friends I took away from it."
bad,The job in itself was ok it is a good job if you are able to work by yourself as you are left alone quite a bit which I liked also good place to work on you team building skills.
bad,"The overall job at Target wasn't too terribly bad but it wasn't for me. I couldn't stay there. I was getting paid enough and when the store didn't have an item that a customer was looking for, things always got a little hectic until someone was able to tell the customer sorry but ""we don't have it."""
bad,ones work always goes unseen. Management is very horrible and also many tend to think they are better than others. directed issues are never solved or fixed.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working at target management is very unorganized very confusing they expect you to finish all tasks at a certain amount of time on top they add more tasks from other departments! I worked in target in North Carolina and I was like wow and also there always short staff and I’ve seen a lot more people getting hired but can’t manage to have more people on the floor .
bad,There is no common sense when comes to management and making our schedule. They seem to “fly by the seat of their pants.” They never seek our input when it comes to the job.
bad,"I was really excited to find out I got this job!  However I was recommended the Barista/ Food Service job as they said I would be able to get lots of hours.  My coworkers are very sweet and fun, but it always feels like we're constantly trying to catch up (ie. our manager hardly ever stocks, the freezer is constantly blocked by other Target items, and we get the most ridiculous hours).  A typical day looks like arriving at 7am to open, and then running out of various items until your mid-shift gets there so you can make a fridge, freezer, and closet run in less than 30 mins.  And when we complain about the lack of hours, nothing is done!  We were recently complaining about getting 20 hours when we were originally promised 40, and then our manager hired a new barista!  Also, even though we work at Starbucks we are technically Target employees, so we don't get free coffee, food, or paid lunches like all the other Starbucks employees.  We recently were allowed to accept tips, but we're not allowed to have a jar out...No benefits bc they won't schedule us more than 30 hours a week, and nearly once a month we're given more tasks to do with the same amount of time, which means we're essentially running around like crazy people for 8.5 hours a day trying to cram more responsibilities in.  I had to pick up a second job to pay my bills, but now it just creates scheduling conflicts so I try to work both in the same day.  Very unorganized, the manager had never worked in the food industry before, so we're often doing parts of that job to make sure we are ready for the next day.  It's exhausting."
bad,"When I first started working at target everything was good. I actually enjoyed it. Now they changed so many unecessary things, I dread coming to work. My “ETLs” don’t do anything and basically are LAZY. They don’t help out with anything at all, and it sucks how the STL can’t see that too. It must be nice not doing anything while getting salaried. I don’t see what their role is anymore when all the associates are basically responsible for everything now so definitely not worth it anymore for the pay Atleast."
bad,"Managers are out of touch with what actually happens with employees, seeing specialized positions eliminated and a pointless visual merchandiser position added was the last straw for a lot of us"
bad,"I've been working at Target for about a year now and I still have yet to be fully trained nor have I been able to log in to ehr (problem with my log in). I was told I would be making more money then I am now om three different occasions, however, they always find an excuse not to give me a raise. Certain people are relied on way too much, while others will get barely any hours. They constantly call me in, ignoring that I'm a student and it's very difficult for me to work on a moments notice. There seems to be a lot of drama among the managers and they have a very strange way of running the store, and they never explain it to the people it affects. The pay is good for the work, but some weeks are extremely stressful, and the management makes working here very annoying after a couple of months."
bad,"My work at Target has basically been out of necessity to support my wife and kids. There's little to no room for growth, as executive lead positions require higher education at which point you're better off seeking a better environment. Corporate decisions hardly make sense from the store's perspective and are usually indicative of the company's toxic culture."
bad,"The job was light and fun work was never a drag, good place to have as a first job. Benefits were decent and management was always fair I would recommend working here."
bad,"The first few months of working at Target were fine up until I realized how awful management is. Nobody ever seems to do good enough apparently. Management also seems to be big into the drama, which there is tons of! Yay! I have had former team members tell me their horror stories. Honestly, as long as you never speak to anyone else in the store and annoy the heck out of guests you’ll be fine. You’re also never guaranteed your breaks (if you need someone to cover), only lunch."
bad,"Ok, the pay for Target is better than most other retail places, but the work they expect from you at that rate is ridiculous sometimes. They expect you to do the jobs of 2 sometimes 3 people by yourself. If you're a kid and need some spending money for the summer or christmas break, go for it. Otherwise, don't waste your time working for a company that only cares about making more and more money without doing anything to help its employees out."
bad,The upper management was not good working with different types of personalities. Was an revolving door for hiring new people. No movement within the company.
bad,"So it is hard to give this place a high rating. I don't know if it is just my store location, or if it's the company over all, but I've had a pretty bad experience here. So lets go down the list of things I've went through and see if makes sense for anyone who reads this. I was made fun of by some of the old management. Told I wasn't working hard enough, then when I did work harder and faster, I was told I still wasn't good enough because I couldn't meet their unrealistic expectations. (i.e. working and back-stocking a pallet within 20 minutes.) I filled in for my team lead who went on medical LOA. During that 4 month period, I didn't get any additional hours, no additional pay, no benefits, but all the responsibility that came with the job. Recently, in the past 4 weeks of this post, I've had to call off three times. (two of those times were for a funeral, the other was a family emergency.) Each time I called off and spoke to one of the leaders on duty, I was told that everything would be taken care of. Each following day I was called by Target, saying I was a No call No show. I talked to the HR and got it fixed, but that shouldn't have to be done. I know a lot of people work at the store, but for this to happen constantly is kinda silly. Only good thing I have taken away from the store is the amazing friends I've made, and learning the role of being a leader."
bad,I worked at Target while my husband was in school and when my children were all home and in school.  It was great in the way that they allowed me to work a flexible schedule so that I could work full time and still juggle things at home.  It was a very stressful job with deadlines and specifics with cake orders.  The hardest part of my job was when there was too much to do and not enough time and help to get it done well.  The most enjoyable part of my job was when things were scheduled well and everyone was getting along.
bad,"Overall the management is what makes it bad. If you try asking for more hours or try resolving any issues you have with your working environment they assure you they'll fix it or help you, but change is never made. Not to mention the lack of training, especially if you are front end. However one of the nice things is that they give 15 minute paid breaks every 4 hours and a 30 minute lunch break every shift. My favorite part of the job is giving stickers to kids coming through my check lane, no joke."
bad,"Being on your feet for 8 hours a day when you're able to move around is different than when you're on your feet for 8 hours a day standing in a stagnant position. Standing still behind a register not being able to sit or leave is very physically difficult. Breaks are not run well and if you work in the food service section of Target then your breaks are more easily forgotten by managers and if you're gone, then they keep the food service open, but do not fill any of the orders so you can come back to a giant line with 10+ orders because other members who are NOT trained in food service cover your breaks."
bad,"Target breeds a loser culture, a bunch of entitled children who dont want to do anything to help themselves. I'm not even that much older than the people who work there but most of them are simply put just pathetic losers. Managment isnt much different, you give them an inch and they will take a mile. Be consistent with everyone there and ignore them if you want my best advice. No one there is an exceptional individual by any stretch of the imagination."
bad,"I learned how to use a handheld scanner, stock and organize shelves, and unload trucks."
bad,"HR and Management were inconsistent and unfair to the Cashiers in terms of scheduling and taking time off. A typical day at work was fine, but the hassle to receive your paycheck (if you weren't using direct deposit) or to take days off, wasn't worth the time working there."
bad,"Target used to be a great place to work.  You could have some fun, do your work, and help guests.  Now it is so stressful, because the company is trying to compete with amazon.  A typical day would be: you need to get all of your work done, but you shouldn't be focused on tasks instead selling to the guests shopping.  But why haven't you finished your work, but now your not selling to the guests.  It is an extememly stressful situation when you want to do a great job but it is impossible because of how things are run."
bad,"Better pay and better hours than my previous job. But for some reason, the managers would never tell us what were meant to be doing, always be hard to reach to ask them, and then get angry when you didn't magically read their minds to know what they wanted done."
bad,"Target is great part-time job, but it is not a place for a career. The managers have unreasonable expectations and do not seem well trained in their area of work. Overall the company is a great place to work at, but that's only if you have well trained managers."
bad,"Target started out as a great place to work. Aspects of the job are still enjoyable, but overall I can't say that I would recommend it to anyone unless you are okay with being under payed, over worked and stressed out all the time. "
bad,"Target was a fun and friendly place to work. I enjoyed the challenge of meeting are daily goals, for signing up customers with are Target credit and debit card."
bad,It is hard to have pride in your work when you are not appreciated and the management cares more about sitting in their office than helping the team get their tasks complete. It is hard to maintain a positive work experience when your ideas are constantly torn down and not appreciated.
bad,"I loved working here and I still do, but they are severely ignorant to common economic principles. They do not incentivize working hard in any way. I have stood out among my peers for close to 4 years, yet I have never been given a decent raise or decent compensation of any kind."
bad,"would not recommend target in towson. most people, even from different stores, would not recommend working for this company. it is horrible and the discount suck"
bad,"I was with Target for over a decade.  My former coworkers are now friends for life.  I learned so much in my time at Target Corp.  The first 9 years were great.  However, with a change in upper management it was no longer a great place to work for the last 3 years."
bad,It was okay working there. The management is not great but pay was great no place for you to grow. Sometimes it's too stressful too competitive not enough recognition for the crew people
bad,When I worked at Target they make EVERYONE cashier regardless of what position or department they hire you in. And every 20-40 minutes they call people up to stop what they are doing and run up to the front for mandatory backup cashiering. Target likes to shuffle people around departments often cross training people to fill whatever roll they please. Very flexible scheduling which is nice and they used to have a swap board where you could post a shift and someone might take it or you can take another persons shift. Overall the hours were sketchy and they really FORCE extremely on people to push target credit cards onto people. It gets really old. overall unless you are right out of high school finding a starting job or desperate for money I'd look elsewhere.
bad,"Recent General Manager change, and ever since it's been hard to make ends meet with the new environment being very stressful with micromanagement and scheduling outside of my availability causing me to either call out or have someone take my shift making me lose out on hours. I've been working at Target for over 2 years and loved my job and working environment. Since the new management came in, the atmosphere is drastically different and I don't look forward coming in and doing my job like the way I use to."
bad,"The management is poor, if you are not highly favored or doing things the wrong way, you will not get promoted! The hardest part is the management if you have a problem you have to keep it to yourself because no one cares."
bad,the work to pay ratio was terrible. there were no benefits for the position and we seemed to be constantly understaffed and expected to improve sales numbers.
bad,Target isn't a place I'd recommend unless you really need a place to work. I regret most of the 7 years I wasted there. Most of the things that would make you hate your job are present there.
bad,"Was an employee for some time and found that I learned quite a bit. The coworkers were very nice. However, some managers were bullies or didn't care to train sufficiently, then got mad when deadlines superimposed by their bosses were not exactly met. Made for a miserable experience. The job itself was okay."
bad,"It's a fast placed environment, if one can't handle stress them look elsewhere.  The team leaders are careless and your job has to be completed.  And beware of working at a fast paced environment. Instead of getting recognized they will load you with other duties on top of the load of work that will be handled to you because they're always short staff."
bad,"Good pay, good first job, but once you’re a non-seasonal team member, then it turns terrible. At first,  I was really happy that I got hired on, but now I’m being forced to work a bunch of pallets myself. I’m extremely underscheduled, and I’m also pushed too hard at this job. Human Resources doesn’t help. Team leaders don’t listen, and the only fun part of this job are breaks and leaving. It’s sad, but true."
bad,Management is horrible. The company itself is very diverse and the team members are amazing. It used to be a fun place to work before new management..
bad,The atmosphere at Target is chaotic. The hours and days you work are erratic. Compassion and empathy for employees be they sick or injured is nearly non existent. There are some fabulous team leaders that make you feel valuable. But as a whole I wouldn't recommend working here.
bad,"by far not the best either. Very impersonal the way the treat employees. You are a barcode here, replaceable and it makes for a cold environment. Not recommended."
bad,"When I started working at Target I actually enjoyed it for a few months, coworkers and customers were very nice. After a while the management was not very fair, did not give equal treatment to their employees, and talked down to us."
bad,"Multitasking is a must. You will either be coached for not going fast enough or coached for not helping others. You are on the bottom rung of the ladder, you do what you are told do and nothing less. Do not expect advancement."
bad,"just check gun machine tell numbers and counts, open boxes then put sheft and follow numbers and it is right or wrong numbers.. sometime quick open boxes put sheft and check label numbers and names. and more..  pretty good and lot motive. I love it and enjoy fun."
bad,A typical day at Target was a very stressful environment with many call-offs and me having to do most of the work for my department which varied from shift to shift.
bad,New members were not very welcomed on by mangers or other members who had currently been working there. Rules and regulations for break times were not properly discussed for a cashier. Poor communication.
bad,Management only cared about their advancement and were never interested in helping your career growth. They were always quick to judge a mistake but never took the time to correct and teach from it.
bad,"Need to spend more on experience talent. Will take college kids and put them ahead of experience because of a degree. Very hard to remove bad talent"
bad,Started as beauty team member. Of course there will always be coworkers trying to put you in drama but you can always not put yourself in the situation. But the management team was terrible. Not all the of the LODs but majority of the ti they would have issues with you and not confront them to you as an adult and to me target speaks on being a place of team work and I didn’t see that at all. It’s a great place to shop but I would never work there again. It’s very flexible with working around your school schedule
bad,"I worked long hours and expected to be the STL without getting STL pay."
bad,"Employee dissatisfaction,  too many managers not enough employees, lazy managers, expectations outrageous at times.  Employees all work hard and are very friendly.  Not treated nice."
bad,Target has a great work  environment. but you are under paid and over worked. I worked at Target for a little over 4 months with no raise. One good thing about target is that your opinion does matter.
bad,"This employer had a very stressful environment for the employees.  If you are not in with the right person, you would not be treated fairly. I would not recommend working here."
bad,"this job taught me a lot how to manage people and count money on a constant basis. Also, I had to process and sort out inventory on a weekly basis plus managing other employees."
bad,"target is a nice place and it has a safe and clean work environment, but its very slow pace and very boring. this may not be a problem to some people but it was a major problem for me."
bad,"-Fast Paced."
bad,most people dont do anything and management only relies on the good workers to do the work intended for the whole team. most people are friendly however.
bad,As much as I love target as a consumer I still could not recommend working here as a former employee. If you are not nagged by managers it is the consumers or vice verses.
bad,"working at Target is a very easy job but the hours a short ,customers are nasty and your coworkers will eat your lunch .some people hate it but they need the money."
bad,A typical work day wasn't the worst but the management directly above me wasn't the best. All but one manager was extremely lazy. But she no longer works for the company. Most people that I've known to work for the company have quit due to bad management.
bad,"My manager was very helpful and understanding of personal things outside of work. Didnt really care for the last minute shift changing, that sometimes was very frustrating. great company to work for."
bad,"Their catchphrase says it all ""Expect More, Pay Less"". Yes, they do! The ONLY good thing about working at this hole was my co-workers! Don't expect help from management because they're too busy giving you more to do even though you haven't been able to finish your other 12 tasks. Jerks."
bad,"I work only part time as a Cashier and I start at 12pm till 4pm.  During the weekdays, it's super busy at 3pm always.  "
bad,"The overall job is very easy as long as your dedicated and focus. The management is decent, needs lots of improvement. The thing I enjoyed most about the job is the people I've met."
bad,"Some managers talk down to you, everybody is paid the same, no room for advancement, they mainly want you to have a college degree to advance , not enough hours to even survive off of"
bad,"I felt that their was no opportunity for advancement. They only advanced people that were ""favorites"" and if you were not a favorite, you didn't advance.  i was always above 105% of goal and a good worker, but was never given the opportunity to advance because I wasn't one of the team leaders personal friends."
bad,"Employees cycled through and left company quickly, weather by choice or not. Pay rate was kept low and not given unless ""earned"". Time everything, people are treated as numbers and not actual employees."
bad,"I made lifelong friends there, so there`s that. That`s about it though. I was happy to leave, and happy that they don`t operate in Canada anymore. Didn`t care for most of the management."
bad,"There isn't much structure in anything they do and they tie your hands at every turn making it almost impossible to do your actual job. "
bad,"It frequently required breaking down shipments and getting them to other departments, and we had to do everyone's job but our own. The team leads wouldn't stand up for us and the store owner took our resources and would shout at us by the end of the night when a group of college students wanted to get home at 1 AM after the rough shift. Endless, tiresome, unrewarding, not creative. My experience at Target wasn't a good one."
bad,Great with my schedule everyone is nice but the hours are not good you usually only get 4 hour shifts they expect alot of work in a little bit of time they is not alot of rom to advance
bad,"Management would give employees prizes, bonuses and lunches. Target has fun atmosphere and everyone there is very friendly. Flexible schedule and would give time off as needed."
bad,Interesting work experience; first introduction to retail and it was fine.  My location in particular was very understaffed and the people brought in were not motivated to work which made training hard.
bad,"Pros- meeting new people making new friends. "
bad,Worked there for a year and a half and was trying to get promoted. They would have me do GSTL stuff but would never promoted me to that position. They started decreasing my hours by a lot and I got really frustrated with management and how they treat people there
bad,The manger I worked for was very sorry. He did not care about his employers or anything about the job. h Didn't like most people. He always had an attitude.
bad,"Company on paper says the right things.  In reality they drive people to the ground.  Value a college degree over job experience."
bad,"There was one good manager who was promoted and things went downhill from there. We are a small team, under 15 people, but about 4 of us have to carry the under performers. The starting times vary between 8pm and 2am and the end time is when they decide you can go home, The office itself great and the facility in brooklyn park is beautiful, it has everything you could want...cafeteria, fitness rooms, showers, coffee shops, game room,  gift shops, yard games, a beautiful courtyard, easy parking."
bad,"Unprofessional management. If you have a problem management will tell other employees that Re not in a manager position. They claim Target employees are ""team members"", I never felt like part of a team. I was told I missed to much work and was punished by having them not scheduling me for a week. The time I missed I was in the hospital with a doctors note and my mother in law passed away. They made me try to feel like both of these were my fault like I planned them just to miss work. I love Target for shopping but they need to evaluate their management if they want to keep employees."
bad,I had an overall negative experience working for Target. They originally hired me for a different department than I ended up working. I seemed to have a different shift lead every day and there was an obvious lack of communication between them. Very unpredictable and rigid schedules.
bad,They enviorment is okay. Some of the management is nice. Some of them are mean. They don't move anybody up in that place. they only cared about certain sections of the store.
bad,This is the typical retail employer. It's a good place to work if the local management is good. The pay could better for the hourly employees. Benefits are good
bad,I really had no complaints about this job. All of the co-workers were nice and helped me when I needed them. I really had no problems with management nor the co workers at all.
bad,Target professes work/life balance but that only seemed to be truthful with the youth without children. Younger employees seemed to have less responsibilities. There wasn't much flexibility with scheduling.
bad,"Great customers, poor upper management, horrible hours. not willing to work around any schedule. pays half check and half cash. felt like a slave."
bad,"Target was a good working environment. However, the benefits were TERRIBLE. There was only a 5% employee discount (which doesn't even cover the sales tax) and when I became pregnant and was put on bed rest nothing was done to secure my job. Then soon after the overnight positions were removed from the store. This left a lot of people with no choice but to leave nd start from square one elsewhere."
bad,"Management always wanted us to push red cards and would even pull us into the office to discuss ""better tactics"" at approaching the sell of the RED card."
bad,"management never knew what was going on always confused and never capable of performing a simple task, the co-workers were great they made the job more enjoyable and made the days go by quicker"
bad,"It was a really cool place to work, nice co-workers, pretty smooth job. I wouldn't recommend to anyone that doesn't have a flexible schedule though. But overall it was fair"
bad,"Pay is average and its hard to find hours, but its a great job for a business, sales, or communications major. Advancement is almost non existent."
bad,Great place to work just the travel from my house to work was a little aggravating. It also didnt help that the job was seasonal.
bad,Not enough training. Really had a hard time adjusting to what i was trained to do and then switching to something different. I was very confused by all thd changes they put me tbrough
bad,"Horrible culture at West Jefferson DC. I had 30+ managers, 10+ Senior Managers and 5+ General Managers in 12 years. The compensation is good and makes you feel like you are trapped there. "
bad,"-Greet customers and answer questions they may ask"
bad,"Work is basic, does not require a huge amount of effort. But the work itself is very mind-numbing. Most workers are great people, with great stories to tell.  Entry level positions start at minimum wage, and offer no benefits besides a paycheck.  Hours can be inconsistent, especially with seasonal hires"
bad,"Work starts at 22:00 and finishes when the work is done. Usually heavy workloads pulling items from backroom onto sales floor. After pulls are complete we either help flow team stock store or stay in the backroom back stocking product. "
bad,"Worked there for two years and change in the Hardlines department. The Team Members and most Team Leads were all fairly solid folks. Most higher than that were extremely out of touch with what exactly our job entailed, and they would assign far too much work to far too few people. Pay is not great, and the raises you get are very small. The job isn't worth the hassle you get from Guests."
bad,"Early stages of agile transformation. Level of maturity and engagement differs widely depending on the team you are on."
bad,"Lots of great people, use of heavy equipment, running around and finding merchandise, made this job really fun. Some heavy lifting but nothing major."
bad,"The job sucked. working overnight felt like a drag. daytime employees seemed to be coddled, while we had to do their work as well as our own. coworkers tend to be lazy, so expect to do their jobs as well. they give promotions to people who are incapable of doing a great job. Scheduling seems to be a weak point as you will get scheduled on nights you are unavailable. you get yelled at for being unavailable. people are very soft/emotional here."
bad,"Very challenging and well compensated, but the work hours and lack of well prepared management make for very stressful nights. Some may enjoy these hurdles but others will be lost due to the lack of good communication"
bad,it good to work for but they do not take care the employee that been there the longest only get about 4 hrs three days a week or 4 days a week
bad,"if you don't have a bachelors degree don't bother trying to become a manager, you will be met with a big NO! They recommend you have a bachelors but it doesn't have to being in business, and most of the positions don't require a degree at other large chains. And the recommendation is more a requirement with no exceptions. Also don't think of trying of having a second job they want you loyal with barley above minimum wage and no benefits except for managers not supervisors."
bad,if you can get past the bad management and impossible expectation you'll have fun working there meet a few good people but this is a step over job something you do while waiting for other opportunity unless you are trying to work in management because turn over rate is very high
bad,"Worked for company for ten+years. Knowledge of company policies and procedures will help with cross-training and gaining hours when hours are lacking. New management can have an impact as to whether or not they feel you're a fit for them and their ambitions. If they don't want you on their team, they will find a way to performance you out, or make you quit in tears. Some stores have their ""cliques"". The store I was a team member at, has a huge one. All management. There's a lot of double standards. They will pick and choose who they hold accountable."
bad,you unload the trucks at a very fast pace and go out on the floor and stock the shelves and then they try to get you out of there as quick as possible. They want to get you in and out of  there as cheap and fast as they possibly can.
bad,I really enjoyed working with good people. I wasn't very pleased with the management. There was limited opportunity to advance in the company.
bad,well was great when i started but had some medical issues then was fired because of it made me be off work for a week but held it against me for a week and said i did no call no shows
bad,"typical days include stocking store, helping guests , helping cashier when needed. at night you straighten isles and return products from customer service. management didn't really bother training me because i knew what i was doing but i didn't really get trained for target procedures or shown what to do things like that, nothing was really hard but the most enjoyable was that they gave you a lunch if you worked over seven  hours"
bad,"Everyday me and my other three co-workers on my team would come in and try to complete the workload for the day. The work was easy and straightforward, and it took me no time at all to catch on. The last couple months we've had our hours cut so it is basically impossible to finish the entire workload everyday. Our team was getting a lot of trouble from managers and hire-ups when there was nothing more we could do about getting our work done. I really enjoyed the people I worked with, but I was tired of getting talked down to by managers."
bad,I loved working at Target until I became sick at work and was on an extended leave of absence.  When I was finally allowed to go back to work by my doctor I was not allowed to go back to my old job.  I worked 40 hours a week before I became sick and now they are only giving me 12 hours a week.  I have a family that depends on me and I cannot live or pay my bills on 12 hours a week.  I can understand them putting someone else in my old job because it is important but I cannot understand them giving teenagers who still live at home with mom and dad more hours than someone who has been with the company for 15 years.  I am not the only one at my store who is treated like this.  They are a company who has no loyalty to their employees.
bad,"Dont feed unless seasonal because the amount of work you day and pay does not compensate equally."
bad,Good job if your in school and dont need many hours management is awesome most of the guest are great Very good beginner job
bad,"The most redeeming quality of Target are the friendships that are built over the years.  Co-workers are fun to work with on a daily basis."
bad,"Target was once a great employer who treated people well. It has since become a place where you are asked to accomplish the impossible without being given the resources to accomplish the bare minimum. They continue to roll out half thought out programs that are not backed up or are in beta, adding to the stress of an already stretched workforce. Most of the veteran store level leadership has already left. Many of the district and above leadership have never worked in this new, extremely stretched Target and have problems relating."
bad,"Overnight unloading at Target is a difficult job, it wrecks havoc with personal lives and schedules, but is fantastic work if you have no other daily obligations."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting and checking guest out, friendly/light warm conversation and handling cash the majority of work."
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with but the Pay is very low...The management is horribel as well...In there eyes family and personal like is meaningless...Target comes first.
bad,"Unfortunately at Target there is no more scope for me to grow in my role, Hence why I am looking for a new job."
bad,Wish I was working else where.  Been there for several years and work numerous positions and gained a lot of experience.  No type of advancement at all.  That could of been for the target I was working for but just telling my experience from the one I was working for.
bad,"A normal day at Target consists of me organizing products into carts, then taking those carts and stocking the product on the shelves."
bad,"Checked and cleaned work area I took care of. Enjoyed putting out items for the departments. Helped customers find what they were looking for by escorting them to the section of the store for the item they were asking about for example: if they were looking for bed sheets I walked them to Bedding Department and looked for an associate or called for one on the intercom. "
bad,As a Sales person I helped guest make decisions on to go with a  post paid and prepaid account.  Also helped anyone in the electronics that needed help.
bad,"Management held focus on speed and accuracy, low hours, Usual work flow was intense for three hours of merchandising and shelving then out the door."
bad,"Worked there for 3 years and 3 months with no problems until my type 1 diabetes started giving me trouble, and had to take some time.  It was a struggle on both me and my family!  After returning to work I was treated completely different from the way that my other co-workers and (myself before complications with diabetes) occurred."
bad,"This location closed within two months of me getting a job. "
bad,"If your looking for advancement, not a good place to be . They do work well with students, but they don't offer any benefits for part-time workers and yearly reviews are a joke. Not the worst place to start but not the best either."
bad,"When I started at Target, the logistic hours were 4 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. to assure replenishment before the opening of the store.  The majority of my job duties were in the back room, but there were plenty of opportunities to deliver ""fast, fun and friendly"" service to guests on the sales floor.  I also picked up cashier shifts on occasion.  I enjoyed the job, but found it difficult to live off the income with inconsistent weekly hours."
bad,"The Taxi business has been faltering in Montgomery county for years, given the degree of service offered by Barwood taxi.  With the introduction of new options customers demand lower prices and better service.  As a reservations agent you will make reservations and handle irate customers at times. growth is a non factor"
bad,"They were okay. Was not a fan, and I have to find other employment. Set focus sheet and planned the day new daily route to make goal."
bad,"Fast, Fun, and Friendly work environment.  Great benefits and compensation.  Flexible working schedule, however you are required to work every other weekend and at least one closing shift a week.  The most enjoyable part of Target is the people!  However, the company has unrealistic expectations and continues to reduce leader headcount.  This focuses each leader to take on more with no additional compensation or reward."
bad,A typical day is stressful with never having enough employees. I have gained a ton of experience but sadly am not using hardly any of it.
bad,"They are very pushy about selling Target Cards, unwilling to work around my availability when it changed after the birth of my son. Little to no room for advancement, despite numerous times promising it to multiple people."
bad,target needs to let up on their issue with speed because some people arent able speed up and the leads have  fits if things dont go their way.
bad,"I thought Target would be fun especially since I was a customer first but they always had the schedules messed up, the system was down most of time, Management I felt were rude and not so eager to help, maybe because it was around the holidays but that's not really an excuse."
bad,The day goes by pretty quickly when we are very busy and I have learned many things in working retail and the number one asset you need to work at a retail job is patience.  The management is fairly descent they do tend to play favorites with the younger employees.  My coworkers are quite a bit younger than me so there does tend to be some drama and with that being said that is the hardest part of my job working with younger coworkers who do not have the same moral values as I.  The most enjoyable part of my job is helping guests with purchases and helping them save money and just getting to chat with new people on a daily basis.
bad,"This was a very hard working environment and the money is not enough for the amount of work that occurs on a daily basis. Following my two week notice, due to my wife's medical retirement, I was placed into more difficult teams to meet daily requirements. In the past, I have broken several records for packing and now I am not meeting daily requirements due to team replacements."
bad,Target will teach you many skills. Management is terrible and will give you the sense that you're easily replaceable in the company. Not much room to grow unless you are middle aged. Co-workers are good. Hardest part about the job is working late retail hours for minimal pay.
bad,"I didn't like working there the first time I set foot into the store, but I weathered it out for almost two years."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team of about 200 people and knowing you impact a business of about $40 million annually.  There is also a lot of immediate impact for your efforts."
bad,"Learnt a lot technology wise and in leadership"
bad,"Lot of miscommunication and false management practices. "
bad,"I worked in the backroom nearly 6 years.  During this time; they eliminated team-trainer raises, eliminated merit raises, reduced shift differential by $0.50 then reduced the number of hours you receive diff, and during last 2 years there were as many as 8 different ETL's and Team Leads in one department so there was no consistency."
bad,"I was happy with the company till 6 months ago, they over look you for the great job that you do. Target does not appreciate what the Team Leaders do. I learned a great deal with customer service and how to lead a team to strive to be the best they can be. The management all they do is nothing any more when you need help you ask and they don't or if you want to move up in the company they look at you funny cause you don't have any college back grounds but you have 11 years as a team leader. Years ago we use to have a lot of fun doing activites but now it's all about money. I enjoyed working with our guest and the team that I hade. There was no good communication  and they hade there favorite people. The hardest part of the job was getting every thing done by yourself with no help from any one. I hade a lot of years in this company but they can get rid of you any time they want."
bad,"Even though team members are productive and driven, there is a lack of communication and many technical issues such as crashes on the registers or personal issues with requesting time off or doing anything with the computers and management since the software update throughout the store. I love to vibe with guests and make them feel wanted and welcome so they can come visit again."
bad,If you work there long enough you might earn enough raises to get a decent paycheck but the management can sometimes be hard to deal with.
bad,"I worked here for six months, my 5th month they rehired all of the management. So it was like starting a new job all over again. Everything ran different after that, my hours were being cut and my red card accomplishments were no longer being recognised."
bad,"A typical work day started at 7am and ended at 3:30pm. Enjoyed my job as a whole and working for with my co-workers. Learned about the logistics of the store. Hardest part of the job was have to markdown anywhere from a 1,000 to 5,000 pieces in a day and not being able to find everything that needed to be marked down. It was also difficult to complete task that had to be done in a certain amount of time and being pulled in twenty different directions. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different people I interacted with within a day."
bad,"Typical day consists of collecting carts in the parking lot. Typical duties in the store include helping the front-end by being a back-up cashier when the lines are long, helping guest services throw out any returned products, and helping guests carry heavy items to their cars."
bad,Target moves too fast and doesn't value their employees. They will push you to come up with new ideas yet they don't have the tools and resources or systems to support them. Moving too fast for their own good. They also expect you to get all your work done and participate in ridiculous fff activities.
bad,you're overworked and pay very little. they tell you you're part time but give you full-time hours with half the benefits if any at all.
bad,"A typical day at work would begin with the unload and organization of our freight shipment. After it was palletized it was taken out to the floor and merchandised according to protocol. Once the general merchandise was complete then our food orders would come in and the same process would be repeated. I was also responsible for assembling displays/planograms, weekly ad setup and training new employees as needed. I was also a Pharmacy Technician for the company. I was often shuffled around to different work areas as needed because I was cross trained in multiple areas of the store. I worked on a graveyard shift (11pm-7:30am) at one point and found that the environment was too relaxed. The management treated the employees as friends and my coworkers became hostile, unprofessional and overall a nuisance to one another due to lack of management skills. The hardest part of this job was the physical labor it entails. It requires a lot of heavy lifting and bending along with standing and waking for long periods of time. I also felt that for I was undercompensated for the amount of work I completed on a daily basis. Sometimes I would add tasks and responsibilities for my supervisors and I would not be compensated for it and my annual raise didn't reflect all the work I had done. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the busy environment. When I worked daytime hours enjoyed the presence of customers."
bad,Management was very unexperienced and dreaded coming to work everyday . Team members felt the same way and didnt take there job seriously.
bad,This company is no loger around but when it was they made it an enjoyable place for their employees.  I learned a lot about leadership at this company and gained a lot of work experience being promoted to different area of the company.
bad,"I would usually be assigned a section and a set of tasks and be done with them by the time I was halfway through my shift. Then I would find other work to do and learn new procedures from other sections of the store. Most of the time my reward for doing a good job is to do other peoples tasks. At first it was understandable but after a few months of it occurring and getting the same recognition as the person I am picking up the slack for, I had enough. No ""thank you's"" or ""good job's"" just do twice as much as what you are paid to do. My motivation after that was to work slow and lazily just like everyone else since my hard work wasn't worth doing."
bad,I had a blast working for Target it was productive and fun with plenty of outgoing people. I just wasn't satisfied with the salary because I need more money and a job with some benefits.
bad,I arrive at my place of employment I immediately get a caft from the backroom to put products out on the floor. While placing products in their location I assist guest while they shop among answering call boxes and answering back up calls for the register
bad,Nice company with the ever revolving need towards all walks of life.
bad,"An average day at Target is being able to balance the tasks you have to complete, delivering amazing guest service, responding for back up cashier, managing the team, covering operator lunch and handling the phones. In addition emailing my peers on issues or anything complete so that they are well informed in my areas. The hard part is not being able to balance everything out because time management is not an opportunity of mine but it's hard when we are short staffed and the management team expects more out of you with unreasonable expectations. The most enjoyable part of my day is midday which I can finally catch up with my team and get to know them better, although we are still working I get know them in a more personal level then just treating them as my employees."
bad,Expectation is too high but payment is too low. You cannot even live with that. But Job culture is ok.
bad,"What an okay experience. People work here forever, but it is so boring."
bad,there not that much to do and you dont learn that much.management is okay. co-work are not fun peole to work wit
bad,Good position for recent grads.This is not a great place for leaders searching for new career.
bad,I believe target is a great company and i loved working there.
bad,Inventory missteps cause a lot of pressure on the store team members.
bad,"Target is an ok Place. If you are looking for a job to learn a lot about the retail industry then its a pretty good place. As far as pay rate and opportunities for advancements, good luck"
bad,"Each store is different, but if it's one thing I've heard from all the others in the area it is that there is serious pressure from the team members to the team leaders and the Executive Team Leaders down on to the Team Leaders. Being a Team Leader at Target is no fun task."
bad,"If you don't fit the mold at Target, you will not succeed.  Target does not like independent thinkers who are willing to take a stand for something.  Those who speak the lingo, and put on a happy face are the ones who succeed."
bad,"A typical day as a Target logistics team member will be preparing merchandise for sales floor team members, and backstocking any merchandise that is currently in the back room.  Additional duties include crushing cardboard, pulling hourly pulls, and retrieving items for customers upon sales floor team member requests.  "
bad,"Your typical entry level retail environment, rather casual and laid back for the most part with fun like minded co-workers. Some managers were good people while others had a sense of superiority simply because they were left to run unchecked. The pay is low and hours are hard to come by, you must compete to secure hours. Benefits are equally disappointing."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with children. A typical day at work is ringing up 100+ customers a day.
bad,"Working at Target was okay. I thought it would be a better place to work at. A typical day at work consisted of zoning, organization, stocking, and helping guests. I learned new skills, such as zoning, using a PDF, stocking, back stock, go backs, and over stock. The management could have been better. My co-workers were alright. I was friends with some. There was no really hard part about the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing pleased and satisfied guests."
bad,"Target will lure you in with a good starting pay but once your in there is very limited advancement opportunity. There is also very high turn over rates. They will work you to death(50+ hrs a week) with very little recognition for your hard work. "
bad,Wasn't my favorite place to work not because my co-workers but because of management .
bad,"A typical day at Target included assisting customers, helping team members, and keeping the store looking nice in general. I learned patience and teamwork there. "
bad,"I have worked at two different Target stores and my experience is that you have to try and please every single person that is above you, or you will see that reflected in your yearly review and during your workdays.  My co workers and the days off you get are the only good things I have had working for this company.  If management didn't play favorites, then maybe there would be more people trying to get promoted instead of being cast aside when they do."
bad,"Helping guest find wantever they need from the salesfloor, checking out various people while multitasking different transactions, make sure the guest is satisfied. Guest service is returns of all kinds schecking merchandise in the computer, making sure nothing damanged and if so defecting it out the system while returning."
bad,"A typical day at Target:  Flow Team gets there before the store opens to get the store ready for customers.  Unload trailer at break neck speed, unsafe?  Yes.  Sort freight to pallets, pull pallets to floor, distribute freight to isles.  After unload, as a team ""wave"" stock shelves, one member picks up cardboard, bails cardboard, empties bailer and pulls cardboard bail to staging area.  ""Face"" product on shelves (labels forward in neat rows), take first break, go home."
bad,"I learned how to train new people, my co-workers were fun, the hardest part of the job  was trying to get to the call buttons in time"
bad,"While working there I worked with my brother.  Form the manager down, we all were like family.  There were no benefits and raises."
bad,Very productive company and job security is good as long as you work hard. A lot of places in the company to move up and laterally.
bad,"No room for advancement, extremely demanding work, great staff, friendly co-workers"
bad,cleaning fitting rooms all day while cleaning isles and racks and answering phones
bad,"There is very little to say that leaves a positive impression on this company. Management at store T-1767 is unorganized, uneducated, and a lacking of communication within the teams, I personally feel management is unable to adapt to complete new problems that were introduced, it takes six of them to accomplish minor tasks. Over all the coworkers are great, its a great team environment to work in. But, unfortunately it is a company that shows very little value in their employees, and doesn't give them the appreciation they deserve. No employee should have to work day by day in fear for their jobs."
bad,There management doesn't interact with the lower levels much and since they get so many people they applying they really dont value there employees cause they can always replace them with someone else.
bad,They talk a good talk but the more familiar you become with the company you will realize that they don't actually mean anything that they are saying.  They talk about work life balance and having a great culture but really it is super political and you must step on people to advance.
bad,"A typical day at work would include starting a shift by checking on hourly pulls to stock on the salesfloor, then to begin your section zone. Also, coverage of other areas when needed due to breaks and lunches. "
bad,"The best part of the job was working with the other team members and the guests."
bad,some days are slow and other days are really  busy the TL are like family 
bad,Stocked shelves and assisted customers
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, they were very friendly and forgiving. Benefits were good if you were a full time employee, Poor leadership throughout the entire store."
bad,"Fast paced. A lot of work with not a commensurate amout of pay. Everyone has a limited time as an employee. If you start to look old they start to let you know that your days are numbered. They are trendy. They are good trainers for importing and great trend merchants. They are good ajacency planners. Gay friendly,."
bad,"To preface this, I was on the overnight/early morning logistics team."
bad,"Required to unload and receive freight in a timely manner. I learned how merchandise makes it to the stores, and the importance of handling freight safely. The management team for the most part was a younger group whom recently graduated from college. In my opinion, recent YOUNG grads should not be hired to manage due to lack of experience. The best part of my job was the pay we received for the mindless work we did."
bad,Enjoyed my job.
bad,Great work environment friendly staff mangers all polite pay was accordingly for the work we did
bad,getting the store ready to sell products.
bad,Definitely a dog eat dog company. You may have to suck up here and there just to move up. Definitely had to watch your back and watch what was said. As far as promoting if you didn't fit the guidelines of what they were looking for don't expect to get moved up to the position you really wanted.
bad,"You start with a huddle to get information passed to you, then you start with merchandise pulls to refresh stock levels on the floor, next you wait for back stock from the shipment. while waiting for back stock, you update the stockrooms and clean up any leftover back-stock from day side team, The job is not hard however the management will micromanage while providing zero constructive criticism. The manner in which they address there employees is condescending and constantly belittling them which in turn dose not encourage the team to produce and extra work from them. They come in do what is expected and leave."
bad,"Initially I was excited to work with Target, but as time passed (almost 5 years) I learned that their phrase, ""Expect More, Pay Less"" accurately depicts how management treats employees."
bad,"The manager, Linda was not very pleasant to work with. She was by far the rudest lady I've ever met. Other then that I loved the job and would recommend it to everybody."
bad,"Depending on the location of the store you can have a wonderful experience, although they press the issue of promoting within very few are unless you are promoted within the first two or three years other than that you are pretty much locked into your position."
bad,"Alot of favoritism in that specific store , alot of work with little pay , not alot of hours really especially after the holidays they would scheduled you to work for 1-2 days a week."
bad,I was very disappointed in Target and did not stay long.  I did not feel the position was anything as it was described to me.  I also felt the managers were very young; early twenties and many were extremely immature.  I am semi-retired and did not feel appreciated.  Hustle hustle or leave.  I left.  I believe in customer services and interacting with employees.
bad,This could be a really great place to work but unfortunately this Target has poor management. Great team member discounts and great fellow employees to work with.
bad,"The atmosphere was inviting at first, then it became more of a toxic environment because nothing done by team members seems to be enough for management."
bad,"Mostly good people. Great if you like lots of hours and dealing with customers. Huge turnover. Culture was a lot better in the beginning, not so much now"
bad,"In my experience at a particular target I had the full time schedule I requested for a number of months, but was then let go with three hours to go in my final shift roughly five days before my 90 trial period was up. When I asked for a reason why I was given a vague answer of ""Multiple reasons"" and ""Verbal guest complaints."" I was then told by a direct superior I was eligible for rehire. I can only assume I made someone higher in management upset as there was no actual premise for letting my go given."
bad,"My 2+ yrs. @ Target have been informative in a number of ways. I've learned a lot, met really great teammates and have enjoyed/observed the antics of consumers while in a retail establishment. Our workplace culture is ""guest service is utmost"" and it shows in the way we all work together to see that the needs are met. Teamwork works really well at my facility because we care about our guests. Management, though trying at times, either move on to other stores (YAY)!!!   I'm pleased to say that my crew/teammates and managers are on the ""same page"" - get it done !!! then you can leave. I'd say the hardest part of my job is dealing with these out-of-control children whose parents don't have them behave correctly in a public place. What I really enjoy about the job is when I can advise or help someone find what they're looking for, it makes MY day!!!."
bad,"I'd recommend Target for anyone not in Electronics. The hours they gave me were far more than I'd wanted, the workload is hard for only one person in the department at one time, and the guests can be quite overwhelming. I've had experience in the past with selling electronics, but this was a bit too much. Most items you pull out of the back you have to back stock back in so the system is glitch-y, guests will have you very busy searching for something that says it should be out on the floor but isn't, and expectations just aren't realistic on the sales floor. Not to mention, one of the team leads were too fast paced, pressuring and overwhelming even if you're new. It seems in all other departments, everyone is happy but in electronics, they're very aware that the workload is too much for them and are unhappy with their hours. This job is great for people who need the hours and are okay with stress, but aren't focusing on anything else besides Target. If you're in school and taking hours here, good luck. Co-workers were nice, but the whole overall feeling you get just wasn't worth the good pay."
bad,I was hired to be a stylist and ended up picking clothes up from the floor and cleaning out fitting rooms.  They wouldn't know what a stylist was if one hit them in the face.  Management rude and stressed out.  Do NOT work there.
bad,The managers were not helpful  I wouldn’t recommend working there it just wasn’t for me at all but the customers were the only thing I enjoyed about the job
bad,"After working for Target Rockville, MD for a little over 3 years, I have begun to feel unappreciated and disrespected compared to the first couple years under previous management. They do not value their employees or respect their employees availability and slash hours for no reason even though sales were consistently made. Their is blatant favoritism and “conflict of interest”afoot within management."
bad,"Whenever I had the initial interview, I feel like the store owner did not care about my answers, but I got the job anyway."
bad,"When hired, target makes you believe that you'll be getting regular working hours... For 7 months I was only getting 4 HOURS PER WEEK! Cashiering is monotonous and they don't let you switch departments. It was a joke. If you have a job, you deserve to get paid to live."
bad,With the lack of hours to accomplish the high workload has made the company very stressful to work for. A very high turnover rate from my experience working for the company.
bad,management sucked if you had a problem they were never there to help. sucked when you have seen things that needed to be fixed and your direct manager just walked away
bad,"In 2019 my hours have fluctuated more than ever before they’ve opened a smaller target on campus which doesn’t have as much stuff as the Lennox’s target but in the months between March and December I had steady work until 2019 where even being there as long as I have won’t get solid hours in October "
bad,"honest work for decent pay when starting but bad management. the ""team"" is basically a few (3 or 4 depending on certain things) doing the work for the rest. horrible pay raises one of the bigger reasons I left."
bad,Target is a great first job however there is no room for growth unless you have a college degree. Working there would often be stressful because you would be tasked with too many responsibilities for your current shift.
bad,Target is a wonderful place to shop but when it comes to hours all im going to say is don't make a mistake and have a real life issue that causes you to be late or unavailable to make it to work even if you call and tell them the proper way your hours magically get cut.
bad,"I did not enjoy my time here. They were extremely lacking in customer service, and did not promote creativity for this position which heavily calls for it. Your scheduling needs are not considered which they should be considering the fact that you work based on the time YOU think you can complete it."
bad,"Managers will encourage you to be as courteous as possible, even so far as to refer to customers as ""guests"". But more often than not, the sentiment is not reciprocated."
bad,"Typical work day at Target consisted of checking all fresh produce before store opened, checking all items dates in the database that matched the day-of date, restocking, zoning, helping guests, and backing up the check lanes whenever needed."
bad,"Target is recommended for those fresh out of college looking for a ""how to"" on managing people. Target will hold your hand as you learn all facets of management. You will have long days, 12-14 hours, riddled with micromanagement check ins."
bad,"Co-workers are pleasant to work with "
bad,"The hours are long and awful, 10 am to 8 pm most days. You work pretty much every holiday. You don't even get every other weekend off anymore. Even for retail, the schedule is terrible for salaried employees. There is not enough payroll to accomplish half of what is expected, but that does not stop them from being increasingly more demanding."
bad,Not somewhere you want to be if your trying to pay bills. Better luck seeking a full time job with better benefits. Target is a good job for students in college
bad,"I worked seasonal for 2 months after Black Friday because the HR manager forgot about my 2 interviews I had done and forgot to call even though they were going to offer me a job position. I think I would have had a better time here if I got to know my co-worker's better but since I was seasonal I didn't have a lot of time to learn and to make friends. Also, backroom management and some team members made me feel belittled because I did not know how to do certain tasks even though I was new."
bad,"Working at target was ok at times, but was more for high school kids , didn't stay her long. Management only cared about sales,  never wanted to hear about problems in work area, or try to resolve issues."
bad,Like it but the Etl leaders are horrible! They are two faced and treat team leads very badly. The team members are pretty cool and all get along well!
bad,My experience at target was terrible the managers were very rude the customers were racist and security was useless I was attacked while working at target and no one did anything plus I was told I couldn’t use the bathroom to basically hold it for 4-5 hours until my break
bad,"The job constantly changes is ways that block you from developing any routine or comfort. The changes are rarely good and are often retracted but there will be big changes to how you work every month. They are also shoveling more and more responsibility on the lowest rank employees and giving them the title ""business owner."
bad,"As of June 1, 2019, most employees are limited to 15 hours per week or less.  Store no longer has swap shift board to exchange shifts with coworkers or to pick up extra hours.   Store is a mess due to hours being cut.  Most of the time only one cashier scheduled to work at time, which makes customers (guests) angry."
bad,"Target was truly unmotivational. Even as an individual who can easily motivate oneself to get their work done, Target made it hard to even accomplish that. Very little room to move up and promote and the compensation for the stressful and tedious work was hardly worth the effort. Staffing was always short handed and managers felt that they were too good to lend a hand. Very poor leadership skills."
bad,"I absolutely loved working at Target. As a beauty consultant you'll put product onto the shelves and help guests find what they're looking for. You will be expected to know beauty information such as: latest trends and treatments, what products would be good for the various skin types, what brands of certain products you prefer, the differences between products... etc. Don't worry! Target provides good training on learning about the products. It is easy work if you have a passion for beauty and helping people, or even just learning about beauty because I learned so much! For me, the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with guests. It was fun to build little friendships while you're helping someone find a color of lipstick to match their nails, the right curling iron, the cologne section, all the good stuff. I absolutely loved it."
bad,When I first started with Target it was a brand new store all the employees came in the same time so we became very close and we were a family the management team at that time was wonderful unfortunately there is a high turnover at target but I did love the people I worked with the management was good as time went on the management changed and was very inconsistent I probably would work there again but I’m not a fan of customer service anymore people are too rude
bad,Employees looking to advance would almost always say they were immature to promote and would outside hire. The ones that worked hard would get an ear full for days that they slowed down to the pace of those who worked so slow. The ones that worked slow and did the bare minimum would never be talked to. if  youre looking for a job to work with your outside life though this is a good one as trading shifts is easy and paid/unpaid time off is also easy
bad,"I loved Target when I first started working here. The culture was inclusive, the managers weren't mean, and it seemed as if everyone was a team player. The problem is it's only part-time & when I say part-time I am talking 5-15 hours per week. Can you imagine looking at your schedule to see five hours. Believe me you are having a good week if you get twenty. The good news is they feed you a lot because if they didn't you might starve."
bad,"During my Employment certain roles were cut down in numbers but responsibilities were kept the same. One Cart Attendant to not only handle carts, but spills, restroom clean ups/toilet paper stock. There are times when it would get backed up and the Cart Attendant would also have to be Cashier too. I've heard that its both improved and not quite improved so I'm not sure what more could be added."
bad,it was a temp to hire position and the managerial aspect was great but the job security and benefits were never an option. The hours were okay and reasonable.
bad,"Expectations are a little too high for workload for the amount of hours scheduled for. Management changes all the time, people are generally nice. Management would rather focus on the book 100% than use logic to do something faster and more efficient. If you want to advance, most of your changes will most likely be blocked by Store Manager or higher even though one of the big things when advancing in Target is to make a list of things you'd change and want to change within the Department you are Leader of. Most things are counter productive and takes more time to do than the previous system Target used."
bad,My position was at the customer service desk and being retail was  stressful.  It was my first retail job and was intended to be temporary until I could find something else.  Turnover in management was high making it harder on the employees to adjust to the different styles of management.
bad,6mo probation and then even after working hard they only keep their favorites. Would definitively consider a different job before coming here. its not worth the trouble
bad,"As a barista, they have been severely cutting hours so you are left alone for most if not all of your shift. There are very few people who are certified to cover breaks and they never want to come up because it’s busy and you’re all alone. The turn over is very high because it’s always busy and no one is scheduled to come in and help. Maybe if there were two people working at a time instead of just one more people would stay to work."
bad,"Just expected too much with the little we had, there would be two workers most of the time and absolutely no appreciation for what they did. I work 8 days in a row many times but also only one day a week. The hours are all over the place and hard to live with. The management is very poor, they hardly appreciate employees and honestly spend more time talking about food then the future of target. The district manager comes in and expects everything to be absolutely perfect but little does he know or care to know the struggles to do that."
bad,"I used to love my job as Flexible Fulfillment but after Target implemented modernization I lost all love for the company. I got along great with my backroom team but they lost their positions and were moved to the salesfloor, most of them didnt want to be out there so they quit. With so many people who have worked with Target for years quitting and so many new teenagers coming in the door I feel like I dont know anyone. I feel very lonely there. The only upside is Ship from Store is a fast paced a fun job since its mostly a treasure hunt all day."
bad,"Management is looking out for their own interests and do not care about you or customers. They are yes men/women to please corporate. I had a a bed-side manner coming from the medical field and was appalled about how some of the LODs, TLs, and ETLs treated everyone. If you are self-serving, this is your job."
bad,"-Hours were pretty consistent"
bad,"I got no room for moving up to better position.The other employees were to young for me to relate to.People did not like me, because I was not considered ""black"" enough."
bad,"Working at target ranged from alright to abysmal. In my experience working there for 5 months, I found that there were times where it was very mismanaged. Not to mention the working hours made the job more stressful than it needed to be. My main issue was with the management more than anything else. By far the only highlight I can think of were the friends that I made while working there, whether they were fellow coworkers or guests that come in the store. I cannot in good faith recommend this job experience to anyone."
bad,I worked for them seasonally years ago for a few months. Retail during the holidays is absolute torture. The bosses were kind enough but the scheduling was really inconsistent and sometimes we had no notice when it changed.  Holiday hours were grueling and brutal but days of actual work were few. Maybe three days out of the week and sometimes for 10 to 12 hours.
bad,Enjoyed time at Target. Got opportunity to grow as a leader and impact all areas of business quality and safery. We are business oweners within our departments
bad,I learned a few things at target and I grow a bit to save the least I hope was 1st introduced to being a target protection specialist and I must say I enjoyed it it's great to expand your horizons such as ing them troll of over 200 different layouts security cameras and going hands on on thef subjects but the work for filled itself A bit too intense when knives would be pulled up for simple I like  Electronic items all in all though it was OK.
bad,"An unproductive but easy, timed, and positive environment.. A typical day persists of coming to work on time, unload a truck-full of boxes, stock out product, backstock the overstock, and occasionally set sales plans and price change. The management was great at my first store with taking care of their employees. I had to relocate because of the store closing.  The particular store I transferred to had management that had too many problems and not any solutions, yet get offended when someone had a solution or when challenged.  Expectations were too high for the lack of  teaching and training provided. The hardest part of the job is doing everything the store leader asks, yet still get in trouble for taking too much time doing things the leader's way. I constantly asked or even begged for more hours to work, yet only received nine to nineteen hours a week, despite working hard for four years. There was definite lack of utilization of my talents even though I was trained to do many things. Even when the minimum wage at target raised, there was no real compensation for the people already making that much money. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet and the personalities you bond with."
bad,"They need better management and team lead that are not afraid to communicate with there employees during work,work too hard for little of nothing,no growth or advancement its like you stuck in being a employee forever,unappreciated manager don't give you credit for your hard work and a lot of favoritism in the company."
bad,"Honestly, I wouldn't recommend working for target. Yeah you may make some friends but I don't think its anywhere near worth how awful the management is. They micromanage and stress out all of their employees. Its just a really stressful enviroment to work in and the pay definitely isnt worth it."
bad,the job was a good job. I worked overnight so therefore I was locked inside the store so I didn't have to worry about any security risks. the hours were flexible and convenient.
bad,Bad attitudes and unreasonable tasks. Management talks about employees to others. Do not work with school hours. Ignored availability requests. If you upset them your hours will be dropped sadly.
bad,"I was hired for the flow team, and two and a half months in, they changed positions to DPO which I was among the first to partake in. It promised longer work days and more hours from the 12 I started with, and the workload increased as expected. First year was manageable, and teamwork still played a big role in accomplishing our daily goals. I was promised a steady five-day schedule close to, if not 40 hours per week and was mostly pleased. The 2017 fourth quarter season was rough, but we made it through. However, things started to change around 2018; we received new STL's around the summertime, and corporate direction changed yet again. Corporate has been pushing the company to work midshifts, eradicate ""flow"" positions and give said demographic the ultimatum to work longer hours or be fired (ironically, most of them were older generations). Our store is old and small, but corporate's SFS push forced us to cut into backroom space in order to accommodate for the growing process, making the backroom far more cluttered and tight on space than in the past. They've also heavily cut hours, making it difficult to complete their growing lists if demands and expectations. Teamwork is scarce due to poor midshift transition coverage (closers often come in an hour after the midshift TM has already left), and they do not replace the hours lost from callouts, requiring the [skeleton] crew to pick up the slack while struggling to finish pushing freight and zoning the store. Everyone as a whole is very unhappy with these changes, and morale (and our BRLA) has never been as low as it has been"
bad,"The work is okay and the people are okay, but if you're trying to advance at all, it's not going to happen here. They are trying to make wages higher, but with that comes an average pay increase and leaves no incentives for a real raise. It does not matter anymore how hard you work or how dependable you are or how long you've been there, you're going to make the same amount as the people who are lazy and/or have been there half the time you have."
bad,"Issues with management, and very “boys club” in certain departments. They promise more hours than ever given. Everyone is very supportive and makes the job seem so promising in the beginning but after you make it through your first few months, or the busy holiday seasons, your hours drop, managers don’t care about what you have to say, the holly jolly attitude they use to pull in seasonal hires dies off and usually results in a high turnover and people become dissatisfied. Can’t seem to keep a consistent staff but they don’t care because there’s always fresh blood to replace you with."
bad,"Worked in the electronics sections, was a great job that paid well, I was even one of the highest selling employees in the store. Overall was satisfied with the job and conditions but was let go without warning and when I asked as to why the only answer I got amounted to ""the management doesn't like you"". This was just a few weeks after the company wide minimum pay increase from $11 to $12."
bad,"I've met a lot of new people at Target, and always willing to help out where I'm needed. My coworkers are helpful and friendly all the time. However, the management is lacking strong leadership. I constantly felt like my job was in jeopardy because there were so many different expectations from the several different managers. My coworkers often were stressed about holding their job as well. I've worked in several other retail atmospheres, and Target is definitely more stressful than others. However, I still show up to work determined to help out and get the job done."
bad,Great work atmosphere. Like a family with coworkers. Management doesn't care about workers. Hardest part of job is trying to complete tasks the person before my shift didn't in my time frame.
bad,"I came to target as a seasonal employee. I didn't need the money, but I honestly just needed something to do until I headed back to my main job as a contractor. "
bad,They only hired me for holiday rush so I wa not getting enough  hour o talk to the manger but she said store is very slow  so I have to look for other jo
bad,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers and most of the job but the management wasnt great. Scheduled multiple times outside of availability and called on my days off. However, working with the guest in the store was a good experience."
bad,the job it’s self was very very stressful and fast paced. I personally didn’t like it due to the managers. They were not good managers but other than that it was decent and had great benefits and good oay
bad,"The go backs piled up and were left to only myself to return for the whole store, which was a lot to handle on my own especially while I’d be asked to be on a register for a while at the same time.  I was expected to get through them really fast with not a lot of knowledge about the store since I only worked there for two months. My manager wasn’t very welcoming and I barely worked with her. I always worked later whenever I was needed or came in on my off days. I only called off once and that was when I had a death in my family, after that they took me off the schedule."
bad,They don't have a points system or a grace period so if you are one minute late its a point against you. The managers have their favorites when it comes to rate. They tell certain people about their rate and certain people they don't. Also the managers yell at you and tell you to move faster if you are moving slow.
bad,"The management noticeable plays favorites. They harass, bully, and embarrass you in-front of your coworkers  when you don't finish something within the unreasonable  timeline they give you. They don't include in the time it takes to help out guest. If you complain to human resources about something she just cuts your hours just to be mean. She doesn't take complaints serious and doesn't keep conversations confidential. I don't know too much about other targets, but that's how mine was."
bad,Was very stressful because they took away morning stocking hours and had you stocking shelves with people in them.  It caused stress for employees and guests.
bad,"I wish they would stop saying how competitive their wages are. Sure, starting pay of $12 an hour sounds decent on paper... unless you're in Portland where the minimum wage is $12... Then you're making minimum. Walmart starting pay is $1 an hour more."
bad,Very poor management at my store. The head of the store was always very rude to her employees along with making promises to departments that were never followed through on. Lack of cleanliness due to lack of providing the proper tools to perform our jobs.
bad,It can be hard to accomplish tasks when there is no payroll and frustrating for the team when they are going to bring on 30 additional team members when they can't give out hours to us now.
bad,"The management in my location was extremely out of touch with the workforce, which led to tension between team leaders and team members. Oftentimes, people were hired as temporary/seasonal workers for years at a time and were therefore unable to qualify for benefits..."
bad,"It's an okay job. Pay isn't that good and it can be very boring. Most of the time you are standing by the front door checking receipts and being a ""presence""."
bad,"I only worked at Target for two months as a flow team member. Unloading the truck wasn't bad, but stocking was terrible. The work wasn't 'hard' but the speed at which you were expected to do so was wildly unrealistic. If you enjoy a challenge, go for it, but you need to be basically The Flash."
bad,"My time at Target started off really well but quickly went downhill from there. I was hired for an electronics position but I spent about 5% of my shift in the electronics section. Usually I was sent over to the toys and sporting goods, or infant section to straighten up the aisles. I almost never made any sales because I wasn't over by the guests. They also gave you too large of a work load. I almost never got all of my breaks. The management is a joke. The people are why I stayed, most of my coworkers were amazing and I miss them since leaving. But, there were a select few who were intolerable. "
bad,"Terrible work environment. Back stabbing, favoritism, overworked, stress beyond stress beyond stress beyond stress. They never appreciate your hard work and efforts, it is ALWAYS about what you don't get done."
bad,"Throughout the time I worked at Target I was continually harassed by two different employees that would needlessly criticize my work and attempt to boss me around despite not being supervisors, only mentors (a made up leadership initiative to replace training at Target.) One of them particularly disliked me and would constantly make me feel uncomfortable and also twice decided it was appropriate to invade my space and begin rubbing my shoulder with her hand before claiming that she needed to find herself a boyfriend. When I finally had enough and reported this to HR their reaction was basically a shrug and ""we'll have a talk with her."" She then targeted me and glared at me even more at that point until I finally just quit to get away from the toxic work environment that my supervisor and managers had done very little to fix."
bad,Working at Target was good at first then after my fist week working there it just kept getting worse and worse everyday. I felt like some of the managers thought we were super humans and want so much to be done in a unrealistic time.
bad,It provided a place of employment when I was a younger adult. Not very good for advancement or long term depending on where you live. Pay is not as good as competitors.
bad,It's okay to work there. The hours are great. But management sucks. Just know that they don't know what their doing. They aren't specific enough with there leaders.
bad,"Working at Target is wonderful as long as you are young. As time goes on it becomes more and more obvious that advancement is tied to which manager takes a liking to you. If you befriend the wrong ones you are stuck at your position no matter how hard you work. Atmosphere can be friendly, certainly not the worst job I have worked at but frustrating none the less."
bad,"Didnt enjoy my tine employed here the managers weren't very helpful and were more concerned about redcards than anything else, there was allot of harassment and inappropriate behavior"
bad,I was given many tools while being a team member of this company Target. There were opportunity for advancement in every aspect of wanting to build a goal.
bad,"The communication from management to employees is not very good at Target. They make it so that the employees feel as if they are in constant competition with each other. You never know from one day to the next if you will get a zone with good enough freight that you can make production. They don’t give any sick days, and when you’re sick you have to file for short term disability just to take a day off. When it’s not the holiday season from thanksgiving to Christmas you will be sent home early some weeks at least three of the four nights. Most of those weeks you average from 27-30  hours per week. And during the holidays they will force everyone to work overtime so much that you have 52-64 hours every week ."
bad,Management was bad when it came to help out because we were short handed or we had to do a million things. Team members there were okay but little drama. Overall good experience but. not to be permanent there.
bad,the co-workers were who made the job enjoyable. unloading the truck was the hardest part of the day. the rest of the day was mostly relaxing and easy going until some management came around. they seemed to over stress and rush things that would sometimes present safety concerns.
bad,working with great coworkers making friends yet also helping customers with their purchases and constantly organizing restock in the aisles.it was a first time working as a cashier.
bad,Stocking shelves and helping customers when needed.  The hardest part of the job was to stand out for the work you put in.  It was more of a clique style environment. If the managers liked you you were fine even if your work wasn't great. If you did a great job but the managers didn't like you then you didn't exist. The whole idea of being a good leader at Target was delegating. There is way more to being a good leader than just telling people what to do.
bad,"a typical day was, cleaning up the store,  zoning products, putting back all returned items.  I learned how to zone the products,.  The management team where nice, and helpful"
bad,Target is not fun anymore . If you are doing your job you get written up for doing your job. Management does not stand behind you. They give you a couple days of training then you are on your own.
bad,They complain that they dont have enough people and constantly call people in as replacements but refuse to hire eager employees. If you've worked there before and want to reapply they dont care.
bad,"I didn't really enjoy the policy changes when it came to money advancements. The policies were all over the place from one manager to the next. I would not advise people to work with a communal register, like they force."
bad,"You get introduced to 3 people, who are apparently the managers of the section you work and never see them again as you are working, only to be told later that they don't think you are working at all. How can those people who aren't there as you are doing your job comment on if you are doing poorly?"
bad,Can't expect a lot from them. You get what you sign up for though. Set up to just be there for the short term.  Nothing worth sticking around for and they insure you wouldn't want to.
bad,"The job is overall amazing but the management needs to get better. If they have a problem with what you do they will never talk to you about it, only about you."
bad,"The people I worked with on my level were fantastic, however management was strict and almost abusive. Always being watched and documented as to how you behaved. But for a starting rate $3 above minimum wage, I can't say it wasn't worth it."
bad,Sometimes workers watch you have a long line in still won’t help so your doing everything on your on basically until a manger or team lead speaks up in tells your staff members to get on a register and help out
bad,"I disliked working in the backroom. Cut off from world. Became hectic at times due to having multiple orders, while being the only employee in the stock room."
bad,Overall I was happy working for Target especially enjoyed my co-worker and supervisor.  This was my first job in the United States and did not have a comparison to other companies.  I would not be leaving but they have cut my hours below 16 hrs per week so to send money to my family in Panama I am forced to seek another job that enables me a full 40 hrs per week. I will definitely miss my co-workers but they seem to come and go due to Target Policy of cutting hours.
bad,Target was fast paced. Very little room for error. Paid well and had good benefits.  Target ensured all departments helped with cashiering. Target pushed for all team members to be available for weekends.
bad,"Was sick with ammionia An had doctors excuses didn’t get excused from work even with the doctor notes , found that to cause issues with everything else because I still had to go into work while I was very sick An management wasn’t very helpful at all with that"
bad,There were plenty of cases were they would change schedules and not inform me of this change and still expect me to be there so there is a major lack of communication with the company
bad,"I am a level 1 management, and everyone in my position is fantastic. Almost anyone higher is very difficult to work with most days. I really just stay there for the team members not the job it’s self. Way to stressful for not enough pay."
bad,"I started working in the summer just to make money before going back to college so I was working almost 40 hour weeks. When I was hired I said my ideal was 15-20 hours max. Boy was I wrong. Then when I was going back to school I cut my hours in half completely and had to lose a day for class, yet they still had me scheduled for 30 hour weeks while I was going to school part time as well. There was no one to bring my problems to because I was told there were about 8 (yes eight) people who created the schedules. I would not recommend working here if it is just a job to get by, they like to over work their good employees."
bad,There are certain managers that feel like they can talk down to you because of their title. The supervisors know how to help work and give you instruction on what needs to be done.
bad,worked many hours but my check wasn't reflecting the hours I worked. Working 10 hours and only receive pay for 8 hours. this was and a regular habit of the human resource management. over staffing on slow days and under staffing on busy days.
bad,"I was at Target for about 5 years and never really changed in the position I was in, but it was an good job to work while in school.  I just don't recommend it for an career."
bad,"Love the people the management suck, no one seems to like the flow team and treat us like step children. GSTl dont know what is going on half of the time and it no opportunity for growth,"
bad,"Target is a great place to work if you're just starting out in working, need a second job, or retired and looking for a little something to do.  They have a limited number of hours and getting anything close to full time is very difficult unless you are willing to work in multiple work centers.  Some of the directions the company is taking are detrimental to the work flow of the stores and are negatively impacting their employees."
bad,"A great place to work, but advancement within is difficult because there aren't many opportunities.  It is a good part time job but not a main income job.  I wish there were more hours available and full time positions."
bad,highly uncoordinated. strong favoritism.  Upper managment has changed for the semi better but if the store manager isnt there you notice. Lack of respect by most upper managment. example being the head of HR.
bad,I believe this job should be for someone whose looking for a secondary job or someone who's in school..benefits are great and the credit union with the com0any are awesome
bad,"Great experience, opportunities to grow and expand your time and effort to be the best for the next step in your careers,will also give you a few years of work with a bit of work to do,it is challenging but not worth it,but if someone likes a busy place like that with raging customers then all my respect to them,but I enjoyed it wasn't a bad experience for me"
bad,"I liked helping to drive sales and make the store look great. But retail, at store level can also be stressful, at times. With long hours and holidays"
bad,"Recently quit, they assured in the interview how the HR department checks in with you regularly and always gives you reviews and input on how you're doing. My first day I came in and shadowed another cashier for 2 hours and that was my only training. I only had 3 days of training at Starbucks and then showed up to work and was by myself without any warning to close on my own. The management between Starbucks and target was very poor I had no way to communicate that I was not ready to be alone with no help. I tried asking questions during training but got no help. After a month of working there I gave up because I still had not received a name tag. Not once did anybody from HR or even management ask how I was doing or check in with me and I felt forgotten about and I dreaded going to work everyday."
bad,"No on there does there job I have to often do the opening team job for them which leaves me already set up for failure as a closing team member. The favoritism is off the walls, certain people get their guaranteed hour's others do not base on favorites, they don't pay me enough and certainly not enough to do my job and others. Also never get to leave on your scheduled time."
bad,The work place is always busy and will always have something to do during the day. You get crossed trained regardless what position you get. On the plus side you get long lunches
bad,I don't feel appreciated Iam ready to leave retail there's so much more to me than that so I have to do what I have to do and that's leaving the company
bad,It's an easy workplace. I started loving it until management started giving me problems about missing work because my mom or grandpa was in and out of the hospital a lot.
bad,Too many managers and not enough communication between them. They pretend they are flexible but can't ever seem to give you a straight answer about anything.
bad,"Target does not offer a stable work week of hours!  It fluctuates from week to week!!  Pay is good to very good, but not enough hours for one person to live off of."
bad,Not a great job would not recommend it at all. You are essentially a worker ant running around moving dirt for the hive. Waking up at 3 and busting your butt is not worth it.
bad,"Coming from the point of view of a former Team Lead (Middle Management), this company has an interesting atmosphere mixture. They really try to pull off the caring company face, and have people in place scattered along the chain of administration to pull this off, but in the end, it's VERY much driven by profits and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that. I understand that this company was created for profit of course, however Target would create so much more team member loyalty if they seemed to care at all for their workers beyond face value of looking good to the public. As a team leader I was the person forced to continuously tell team members their hours had been cut, even though we had reached our quarterly goals. it seemed completely backward that they would achieve their goals, and then be punished because now the company sees the possibility of cutting hours and being able to achieve these same goals. So it was actually a complete disincentive to achieve your given work based on their business model."
bad,Probably would be a better job if they hired better management. Management can be vindictive and doesn't always seem to know what they are doing. The best part about working there is the coworkers. Almost all of them are awesome to be around.
bad,"typical work day was like being in boot camp"
bad,"It was a great work experience. Not much skill required for the job. I restocked isles, recalled merchandise that was returned or expiring and provided customer service. Great co workers. I did not like that I did not get enough hours. Job became repetitive. I would say it is a good job for a first ever job."
bad,I pushed carts and cleaned bathrooms and it was the worst experience of my life. I was constantly doing what everybody told me to do and I had little to no respect from my coworkers.
bad,"Shorewood target has a food area, including a starbucks and pizza hut. It's not really that bad to work in that area except that the manager there is terrible. It's the reason I left because I would have stayed if there was a different manager. I don't recommend working in this area at this Target. However, I did like working at Target because of the rest of employees and the pay is pretty good for starting a part-time job."
bad,"I loved waiting on all the customers, exchanging a laugh or two while passing them quickly through the shopping line, keeping my register area spotlessly clean for their benefit, and fulfilling our obligations as cashiers to sign up customers for Target charge cards. Trust me- if you didn't sign up at least 5 customers a day for the Target card you would be called into the office!"
bad,"Poorly run by management makes fellow employees not care about the job. The negative attitude spread and as a result, you get a poor work environment. Hours are rough for any part timers."
bad,"I don't want to go into too much detail but this just wasn't the job for me. "
bad,"This job is great but the management is not. They do not stand by their people and make decisions based on race. Very unprofessional, if the management was different this would be the best job."
bad,"Been with this company for 7 years. B4 I got pregnant I was getting 40 hours a week , now its been a year since i had my daughter and all I'm getting is 15 hours a week and I have asked many of times I need more hours and nothing, I been refused for many job promotions, people who has been there less then (year) are gettig 40 hours. So if you apply good luck for couple years may be great but it's all down hill from there."
bad,Target has good pay and benefits but the management is really poor. They often counsel team members without getting full information. Advancement is very limited within the distribution.
bad,"I'm pretty on the fence as to whether Target was a ""good"" or ""bad"" place to work. I got on well with the people in my department but never really got to interact with anyone outside of it. I'd lean towards a positive experience."
bad,"Target was an adequate PT employer for 10 years.  Unfortunately in 2016, my hours were gradually reduced from 25-30 per week to 4-12 hours per week.  This forced an end to my health coverage and other benefits. This requires me to seek additional employment at a preferred rate of 20-25 hours per week, with availability and hours flexible. "
bad,"Not a steady schedule, Low wage job. Good stepping stone but hard to make a career unless You Get into management which most are trying"
bad,"Target was a terrible place to work.  A job that was understaffed with employees most of the time and the compensation was horrible for a big retail store.  The management was degrading as there unrealistic expectations were outrageous.  The discount was poor and the incentives for getting a job done was a candy bar or a pop.  Overall, my experience working for Target were not the best."
bad,Fun and fast paced.  Different everyday.  Lots of fun traveling and making life long friends.  Getting to live in so many different cities was nice.  Got to live in cities I never thought I would live in or even visit.
bad,They will work you until you cannot work any longer. It is not worth the trouble of getting paid the overnight wage if you're too exhausted to even sleep the next day. I'm not sure what it was like for other Target employees but there was no sense of unity or teamwork I could find amongst my peers and my bosses.
bad,Advancement per target is that you have to be in a position for 18 months before you can advance to another position or another department. This is has deemed to be untrue with the location that i am at and the management will do anything to keep you from advancing or moving forward.
bad,"Target is a nice place to work but only if you are looking for hours that are less than 30 a week. Don't expect to go in and receive hours that are 20+ for at least the first month. They pay rate is okay but again, if you need hours, this is not the store for you or the place for you to work."
bad,"Being a cashier at target isn't bad, only negative thing is the hours, dealing with troublesome customers and the pay. Other wise target is a great place."
bad,it was an ok place to work. low wages no real benefits so it was something to just get by. the biggest problem was the low pay
bad,"This job isn't that hard. Unloading truck on the line can be difficult but the actual stocking of shelves is easy, just incredibly boring. Management has a micro-management tendency. Not much else to it."
bad,"Decent place to work, relatively quiet, most team members are reasonably friendly. A lot of attention is given to ""creating"" a fun atmosphere but it felt like a facade. The leadership is very focused on positions and hierarchy even to detriment of performance and/or expectations. Easy to feel less than valued. Focus is put on doing things only the way the specific leadership requests. Creativity or personality isn't appreciated or valued unless in positions for press."
bad,"On days that you receive your product to put up on the shelves can be a lot. They expect you to get all of the stock put up plus wait on customers, This also includes when you receive the stock"
bad,spent 10 years with Target and was let go with no apparent reason work wasn't too demanding but the Executives where on you all day. even if you where doing a good job they would find things to complain about. managing Team Members is'nt bad but your dealing with people from 16-80. So you need to have a lot of patience and deal with each Team Member differently. Turn around is big. I had a different Executive each year I worked.
bad,I will like it if they would have a better communication with there employees. Management needs alot of improvement.need to hire management within not bring new people in.
bad,"The Knightdale location is not so much of a friendly team as far as management goes. They don't care so much about their employees. On your days off they will call you in. They don't give enough hours or spread long shifts out across the board. They won't work with your availability the head and the current HR can be rude and hard to work with. If you are unable to make it to work for legit reasons they don't care. Target in general can be a ok place to work if you're just looking for part time or something above minimum wage. They start all employees off with 9$ and there isn't really room for advancement they promote who they want to. All sales floor and cashier team members are considered full time and there are no benefits unless you have been there a year MAYBE or you are a manager or receive x amount of hours. Can't wait to find a new job that I love and can work with until I am done farthing my education for my future career.NO ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENTS UNLESS you are the ""chosen one"". Goodluck!"
bad,"A typical day would include interacting with customers. Over the four years that I was with this company, I learned how to train new associates for seasonal operations and for new policies and  procedures as the company saw fit. I really enjoyed the cultural diversity that Target had in it's employees. The hardest part of the job was constant turnover rates and late evenings. The most enjoyable part was working with a diverse group of people who helped me to grow with the company."
bad,No work/life balance. Very long hours. As an Executive Team Leader you have to do everything and a lot is expected of you. GREAT COMPENSATION!
bad,"Target is full of nice funny people, however the computer system that I had to work with was horrible. It was basically double working, which is fine if you are not a busy place, but a pharmacy is usually busy."
bad,This was a high stress environment. There were a lot of different areas to work in so it did not get to dulling. You will always be learning something and its great for guest interaction experience.
bad,"okay work environment."
bad,"A typical day consist of working at least 3 positions at once. You will be helping guest of course, probably doing reshop and returning items to shelves, stocking items that are low in quantity, answering phone calls, assisting on register. The management is decent, accept they do more watching than working. Co-workers are extremely friendly borer-line annoying. the hardest part is juggling the many request you will receive from guest and management. the most enjoyable is working with co-worker to finish a job."
bad,"The worst part about working for Target is that most people are from Minnesota, have never left Minnesota, and dont plan to explore outside of their comfort zone. This causes a workplace where everyone thinks alike and so one challenges the status quo"
bad,"A typical day was to audit store inventory and account for loss, conduct video and physical surveillance. Arrest shoplifters and create paperwork with evidence for prosecution."
bad,"Target was a very hard place to work. Overnight position, very hard to  move up in the company, tough leadership, and low pay. Long commute for me, over an hour and a half."
bad,"PLEASE READ BEFORE APPLYING TO TARGET, FOR THIS POSITION."
bad,target was a great company at first. reason i worked there for so long was the employees i worked with. needs better pay. needs more opportunity for advancement
bad,Everyday i would get greeted with a not so friendly tone with my managers. They would never give me the time i needed off while i was in High School. I did learn team work and customer service from my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was the customers. You'd get mean and nasty people that would try and get something they bought at walmart and return it through us. But thats all retail. most enjoyable part of the job was the friends i made and learning different areas of the store
bad,Wake up hours before the store opens to unload trucks to stock the shelves.
bad,"The individuals working in the store were fun and friendly, but the feeling that you were just a number and easily replaced made for a stressfull and unhappy place to work. The work itself was not bad, physical but not difficult."
bad,"You are treated like you are stupid. It doesn't matter if your scanning scores are high and your customer surveys about how you preform your job is 100%. All that matters to Target is getting guests to apply for a REDCard. As a cashier, you are under so much pressure to get these REDCards. This is part of your job and in the ""Core Role"" description of the job it states ""Communicate REDCard benefits and ENCOURAGE the guest to apply for a REDCard."". Not badger and pressure the guests as well as the employee. This is a $7.50 an hour position and would be a nice little extra job, however, it turns into a very stressful situation if your REDCard quota is not acceptable."
bad,A typical day at Target was clocking in and going to an assigned cash register.  Target had several different cash register managers and only one was really helpful.  The training was terrible.  All they did was get a cashier and showed me how to operate the register with a cash or credit card payment.  Everything else I was on my own.
bad,"target is a decent company to customers, they are treated fairly and served quickly. however, when it comes to employees the company neglects to treat us with decenc and respect. Management is terrible. the management cannot take responsibility and is constantly putting down employees and treating us like children or rather animals. complaints to corporate had to be filed just to get some respect and even then no action was taken and there was no difference in behavior. 90% of employees will agree with this statement. the company just doesnt care. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be my co-workers, you can talk to them about anything and express your concerns to them. my least enjoyable part of the job would be dealing with management. I (and others) are constantly being treated as expendable, worthless, and inferior people. While at target i did learn to process thousands of materials in a quick and accurate manner."
bad,pre opening I will  ensure that that my front cooler was full and all expired items were discarded. Refill condiments and clean soda station. Fill out all logs and create task list for staff. partner with immediate mangers to discuss sales and opportunities. Ensured great customer service throughout the day.
bad,Coming in at 4:00 am to work and unload the truck and sometimes be done by 5:30 am and after that go to our sections and stock the store and have a 15 minute break like around 6:30 and go back to stock and sometimes to finish till 10:00 am to 12:00 pm.
bad,"The ability to sell phones and communicate with new people every day is something I enjoy.  I would actively engage customers and offer them all of our wireless products.  If they needed assistance with anything else I would also help with that.  I learned new ways to sell our products and how to overcome objections every time I heard the word NO.  I manage three employees and taught then everything I know.  We do much side by side selling, weekly recaps of sales and consistently train on new wireless plans and products.  I feel that it is a good work environment but I want to be more successful and I feel that there is not enough room for advancement.  I want opportunity to manage more people, become a leader, and teach people how to become more successful.  Others success is the way I become more motivated."
bad,"bad pay, poor hours, bad work distribution, enjoyed coworkers,"
bad,"Typical day at work was extremely boring, I stayed on the Cash register.."
bad,"The most enjoyable part about the job was the people I worked with and guests that came into the store. After nearly 10 years with the company, I learned structure, patience, family oriented (with one of my stores) and drive."
bad,"All I am saying is, someone needs to do a little of investigating of the Target in Harrisburg PA on High Pointe Blvd. Back track to about 2006 and work your way up. Theres some fishy things going on there."
bad,"If Target actually had me performing the duties they recruited me for, my employment experience would have been more positive.  It is unprofessional to offer one position to a person and tell them on their first day the position is no longer available and they have to take a position outside of their area of expertise and career path. Worst onboarding experience ever, and as a recruiter and HR professional I couldn't believe it actually happened in such a large corporation.  Management basically told me I had to deal with it."
bad,The environment is annoying and the pay hours are terrible. they hire more people than necessary.
bad,"Unload truck filled with large amount merchandise with only two people, specifically men. A fast paced environment, we had to make deadline unloading and stocking store merchandise on sales floor. The management was poor and constantly pressure to make sales by making sure we had everything placed on floor before opening hours."
bad,I would help the people shop was the best part because u got to really know the people that came into the store
bad,Use to be my favorite place to shop until I started working there
bad,"A Typical Day:"
bad,Target doesn't directly care about their employees. Period. They offer awesome benefits but other than that... they suck. Management sucks.
bad,"It used to be a fast fun and friendly place to work but now it's just all about being fast and getting the work out the door. "
bad,"At Target a typical day you are told by management a list of things to complete during the day. It's up to you to manage your time and take initiative. It's a great place to learn the how-tos of big box stores, as team members can always ask for information about any process in the store. Rewards cross-trained workers. Management is problematic. I've had good managers with great hands on capability and and some managers corrupt as can be. Management changes constantly, 18 months is the typical turnaround for managers, which forces you to restart your advancement with each new manager. While rules are in place to allow easy promotion, rules are easily bent to give favoritism. The hardest part of the job dealing with the constantly changing management. Most enjoyable is the co-workers who, as long as they're hourly team members, are very inclusive and very friendly."
bad,"Always FIFO (First in First out) for food. It's a long process but they expect you to move fast as hell and still be doing it right. Everything is ""move faster, move faster"" without thinking about the results so long as it's ""done"".; Supervisors masked their bad attitudes (poorly, I might add) with a fake positive attitude. Led with their mouth, not their actions. Poor leadership."
bad,"Everyone is looking out for themselves at this store, especially Management and Supervisors. Sure I obtained alot of work experience there, it being my first job and thats probably the only thing im thankful to Target for. "
bad,"Let me just say that I wasn't working for Target. I was working for a subsidiary of Radio Shack within Target, but not affiliated. It was a complete nightmare! My personal manager was amazing, but the district managers were garbage! No support! No opportunities! We were in a small town and were being compared to store sales in the San Diego area! How could you compete with that? Had only one day off a week and still managed to make under $300 every two weeks! Comissions for sales were a joke! Thank god another company took over Target Mobile! By the way...the phones are WAAAAAAAY over priced too! "
bad,"I enter the back room, clock in, and head straight into work. I've gained further experience in working a register, advanced my organizational, team-working, and people skills. The managers are somewhat fair, and very understanding. The hardest part is dealing with retail in general. Folding clothes over and over again, doing excessive amount of work for little pay and no guarantee for advancement. Most enjoyable would have to be working with my co-workers. A lot of them are fairly young and it makes it a lot easier and more comfortable to work with them."
bad,if you can deal with the different target culture its a great place to work with family
bad,"Make you learn and do everything in the store, but never gave excellent raises. Was real easy to work at this retail store. No much knowledge needed to work at target."
bad,Enjoyed some things - some attitudes of the permanent employees was kind of clickess.
bad,If you want to work for Target expect not to have a life and be alright with it
bad,"I worked at one of the busiest Target's in the country, they make you earn every penny you make. I was required to know everything that a manager above me knew without the pay or respect."
bad,This is a good job for someone who is physically able to work long hours for great pay. The workers there maintained a positive attitude for the most part while working under a time limit for production that had to be met. Management was not friendly or that concerned with any individual person had going on as long as their production was up.
bad,Not trained properly and job fell horribly. Great management though
bad,"This job isn't the wrost job, but it is't a great job. Manager don't care bout anything or anyone."
bad,HR at certain Targets could benefit from being further trained.
bad,Good job but can be better in many different sections. Pay is to low and not up to par. Co workers are great but management lacks very much.
bad,"The store atomosphere is great for part time workers, however management struggles to connect with their workers."
bad,Target was great when i first started working there then with management changes and other thing i had to leave not only did they make us stay super late they threat us telling us we would get fired if we didn;t stay i had to find something better
bad,Extremely organized company with a plethora of different positions. You can only advance if you possess a 4 year degree. You can get the degree while working in a lesser role but the promotion to the Executive level is not guaranteed once you get the degree no matter what the district level team tells you.
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time employed at Target. My co-workers all worked well together. Human resourses are also very helpful. Management is very unprofessional and unjust. They target and prey on Team members for personal reasoning,"
bad,I enjoy working I like the people that i work with and the job that i do.the hardest part of the job is sometimes feeling as though you are the only one working by yourself but the most enjoyable day is making your guest smile because they are happy at the end of the day.
bad,"Started out of college. Pay is good, benefits are good (for exempt/salaried leaders - NOT FOR TEAM MEMBERS AND LEADERS). Hard work, zero work life balance in the end. Payroll cuts and workload increases made it easy to leave."
bad,"It's a good job, but don't expect to get off when you're supposed to. It's not going to happen. There's hardly any communication between managers and employees, you're going to have to ask other coworkers to catch you up on meetings you should've been invited to. The workload is far too great for the allotted time, and whenever this issue is brought to a manager's attention the response is the same. Target has a system to ensure efficiency but it could be updated. Expectations can change, and be unreasonable some days. Sometimes you'll have to do the work of three people and still be expected to finish on time. You are allowed breaks but I've seen people skip them in order to get the job done. "
bad,They pay great but it’s a waste of time. You work 3-4 hour shifts and In the end your check looks like you’ve been off a whole week. I would recommend teenagers to work here.. or a side gig for extra money.
bad,"If you are gunna work here, dont just stay here make sure its temporary. The only way you can stay and be somewhat happy is if you are an ETL where you are the manager of your area."
bad,They don’t put enough staff on the floor so you can help customers and clean up after customers properly. You are so worn out running from one aisle to another. To much for 1 or 2 people.
bad,"I was hired to work in Starbucks, but because I couldn't be trained I became a guest advocate. I think it was foolish of them to hire someone that they couldn't train. They stopped scheduling me so I am looking for a new job."
bad,Management is terrible. Always have to do Targets job as Market source. Understaffed even with hiring new members who don't have the proper training. Management does not help for everyone to succeed and many of them do not do anything and make other employees work for them instead.
bad,"It’s highly competitive, fast-paced, and you’re given hardly any training for your position. It has a “survival of the fittest” feeling to it. Despite this, soon after, it will only provide security (decent pay) rather than any challenge (repetitive & monotonous tasks). If you’re looking for something to do for money in school, or supplement income, it’s decent. I don’t recommend staying long-term."
bad,Beauty team leader would not work around my college schedule! It was very disappointing. She would not even cross-train me to a different department. I loved working there but she told me if I need to change my availability she will not put me on the schedule.
bad,"Application process was very tedious, it took me about 25-30 minutes to complete it. I had an interview with two managers in one day, there was a lot of questions asked. They would read different scenarios and you would have to explain how you would handle each one. Overall the interview took about 30 minutes. I passed my interview and was hired on the spot. Don't be surprised if you don't get good hours. I barely worked, maybe 10 hours a week if that. My paychecks were only $50 every two weeks. Imagine that as a 16/17 year old. They make the hire speech sound so good but it was a lie. I was hired for ""30 hours a week"" but I was never scheduled for it."
bad,"To say that recent changes are being thought up by people ignorant to store processes and how they effect each other would be an understatement.  Corporate makes easy retail into an unbearable, illogical process.  I would not suggest Target currently as a good place to work."
bad,"I worked inside other targets before, but this one is by far the worst one that I actually work/ed for. The manager at this store is blatantly bias and has his favorites and some of my superiors are actual a**holes that make the working environment toxic and stressful. they think that Target is the number one priority and they don't care about someone having a personal life or  if they are sick and can't make it to work. All they care about is you working your self to death until you are useless to them and they let you go like you don't matter...."
bad,"At 23 I was making 60k+ but I was working 60+ hours weekly, every other weekend availability required. You will work a 6 day week and 4 day week. The 6 day week bleeds into the 4 day week. You can expect to work 60 hours in a row without two days off in a row."
bad,"Not only do you push carts as a cart attendant, but you do it in hot weather. It is a physically exhausting job they have you constantly doing. You get no rests in between besides your 15 minutes break. Be prepared to work doubles, so thats 10+ hours of pushing carts in hot weather. Would not recommend working here unless you like being overworked in terrible conditions. Oh and if you’re trying to call in because you’re sick? Good luck getting someone who actually answers the phone. Tried 9 times in over 2 hours."
bad,They think you can operate a warehouse from a laptop.. the management is unaware hard of hearing don’t listen. Runaway.. the people are nice but they need a upper management overhaul.. the gm comes from hr and try to use psychology to upset you when you have a concern then make it your fault
bad,"Working at Target used to be fun. We used to get free t-shirts, have barbecues, and it was a very relaxed environment. Target used to be more focused on the customer interaction than just unboxing and shoving product on the shelves. Now, it is a very stressful and over worked environment. The management has no respect for the team members anymore, we are expected to memorize sales goals or you get a write up when quizzed on floor, you're given too many jobs to do at the same time, and you're expected to have open availability and work 39.5 hours even if you are a full-time college student. Target used to be a great place to work at, it's gone very down hill since they got rid of the backroom staff."
bad,"The only reason to stay was the people. Workload was way too high with too little time. Company expected visuals, pulls/push for area, truck unload, zoning, flexible fulfillment, and backup for register on top of guest service all to be completed within a four hour shift by one person."
bad,"Honestly working at Target is technically easy.  You have usually the same work load on a day to day basis.  Routines are pretty normal and usually remain the same.  Management literally ruins all the good things about working there.  Half of the managers where clique-y, chose favorites and even would lie to your face and gossip about you.  Super unprofessional.  The other half were understanding but don't really help you with your problems.  It was really hard grasping what the managers really did after they were done delegating tasks.  They 100% relied on their team members to run the departments.  Anyways, as far as the job itself, it should be easy if you take your job seriously.  It is really easy to be lazy here, and if  you are a hard worker you will get frustrated with this basically every shift.  It is honestly kind of a boring job.  Your coworkers will make it worth while.  Most of them are really cool, some of them are really weird and a handful of them are mean."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help guest find the outfits for work and for dates, another thing that was enjoyable part of the job is teamwork."
bad,I was often the only one on busy days doing the work i was assigned to do. I was left to do nearly 3 different jobs on my own on busy weekends with no help.
bad,I meat many great people while working at target. I ended up leaving target because the lack of hours they have available for the employees although the hourly rate is appropriate for how easy the work is.
bad,"The tasks they assign are insane, management is terrible, and communication is practically nonexistent. The people, however, are kind, the place feels like a family away from family. They are supportive, kind, and fun. For the people alone I have stayed longer than I normally would have, but be prepared to be assigned alot of work that they expect you to finish in a short amount of time."
bad,It was a good job for the experience and there were a few great people but all in all it was a retail job so it had its downfalls. Certain departments felt like the communication was lacking and could definitely use some improvement but others worked fine. Not a horrible place to work but nothing really too wonderful about it either.
bad,I got decent hours and decent pay and my coworkers were very nice and easy to get along with. Eventually it started to change when management expected for me to do tasks that I wasn’t trained to do and when I asked for assistance I wasn’t hardly given any. Today however made me want to seek new employment when a manager yelled at me in his office and humiliated me by parading me around the store showing me what I was doing wrong. Never in my life have I been physically scared of a boss that I’ve had until today. The way he handled the situation was extremely inappropriate regardless of my mistake. Overall the pay is good but management needs some serious work and should stop harassing employees.
bad,"The bad thing about Target is that they give you poor hours and expect you to take it upon yourself to gain more hours by covering shifts for your coworkers, rather than just scheduling you with more hours to begin with."
bad,Target has come up with a new modernization process for all their stores which has caused a decrease in hour and increase in workload. Management has also become worse over the years as they have a bigger work load as well.
bad,"Ever since Target raised their minimum wage, they have cut everyone's hours, people are responsible more per shift, and not very many people are scheduled at once. When I started this job I absolutely loved it and had no plans to quit. Now I dread going into work. Maybe it was just my store, but this last wage jump really screwed alot of people over."
bad,"The warehouse I worked at hired managers right out of college and it didn't even matter what they were studying. They had no idea how to run a warehouse and there was absolutely no communication between shifts and different manager levels. If you ask for a transfer they find any excuse to make you unelidgeable for one, if you go to HR about any problems they ignore you and send you on your way as fast as possible. If you can stand poor managment and long boring hours, then they at least pay really well."
bad,"Depending on the store Target is a pretty good place to work if you have a strong leadership team. The store I worked at in Pineville, NC leadership team was terrible. They don’t communicate well and they do not care about their associates. Oh, and PLEASE get on their good side or you’ll end up picked on & fired. The turnover rate is high because of the work and the leaders. Hours are not flexible nor steady- you either open or close, sometimes you’ll have 30+ hours the next week you’ll be down to 10-15.  Sometimes its only one person in a whole department and they expect EVERYTHING to get done...while taking care of the guest which should be your priority. You could feel like you’ve worked your butt off and will receive no recognition. It’s easy to feel unappreciated. The way the managers run the store makes no sense at all which is the reason why people quit so much. It’s almost IMPOSSIBLE to advance within this company no matter how good of a job you think you do or they think you do, they will NEVER promote you or even talk about promoting you. Benefits are awesome & pay is good."
bad,"This company is now all about driving efficiency. If you are an older manager with Target, it is very hard to adjust to the new operating model. The company then forces you out."
bad,"A typical day would depend on the workload of online orders or receiving from trucks, but outside of the peak season (November-December) it's really slow year round. You learn a lot about the warehouse functions, departments and learn to use heavy machinery equipment but it's still a toxic environment. People hate their lives and their job but continue to still work there, most likely because of the pay and it can become depressing even if you're a positive person. I enjoyed some of the relationships I built with people but couldn't work there much longer even though the pay was good. Breaks during the week shifts aren't long enough too."
bad,"Working here, there is always something to be done. Rather its assisting guest, keeping up with your area and the many other things. The staff is also friendly, which makes working more enjoyable."
bad,They team leads and team members under them are great they make coming to work worth it. They work hard to provide guest with service that makes the guest come back but the people in the higher positions recieve the bonuses and raises when the smaller people really are what holds the business together and the company doesn’t see that
bad,"Way too understaffed, putting pressure on people over 18 who legally can work the overtime. The managers weren’t understanding at all with school times, I was constantly getting talked to for their scheduling mistakes regarding the same times every week off."
bad,"The company itself is a good company, some of the policies are ridiculous and they get mad at you when you don’t finish a task they give you when they tell you to do everything else around the store."
bad,"When i worked, my trainers left me after two days and they didn't help me that much if i needed help with a costumer or looking for an item. They aren't reliable."
bad,"there are a lot of politics at higher level. Its not a good company to join as fresher. No career growth in some teams, no ownership of any project or work"
bad,"Stay focus, also stay to yourself be mindful of your breaks. Bring your food and water because working 12 hour shifts you will get hungry, and that’s it."
bad,Really depends on the management. Certain leaders will not care for your well being and throw you under the bus if it means saving face for themselves.
bad,"I honestly just was not happy after the first six months. True Target team members would understand. Awhile after being there you begin to notice the decline in associates on the floor and the effort in teamwork. Guests ALWAYS come first according to Target, however, in some cases they never put their employees first. They would not want the world to know but based off certain sales or RedCard applications, everyone in the company gets a bonus but the cashiers and anyone below an executive team lead. Target is a joke and has no longevity through their young employees that come in looking to eventually have a career. I say apply at Targét— and yes I say that to be bourgeoise for those high class ""guests""— and gain the retail experience because you will learn a lot about customer service, however, don't make a career out of it unless you like being a brown noser for 3+ years or have a degree."
bad,"An absolute joke. Had worked not even 4 days on the job and was already expected to have EVERYTHING down. Was trained my first day for about 2 hours, after that I was on my own to do an overwhelming amount of work with little guidance. Other employees told me most don't stay more than a few weeks. "
bad,"This is 10-12 hours per day of stacking boxes in several different trailers continuously. Not enough downtime, unorganized work environment, and a never-ending sense of ""this job will never be completed"". Management is 5/5, work environment is 2/5, job itself is -5/5."
bad,"This specific Target, I don’t recommend. The managers give you little to no hours but want you do twice as much work when someone else calls out. They barely help you when you need it."
bad,You get paid well for what you do but being a barista is SO STRESSFUL. At the store I was at they only schedule 3 a day. One opening shift. One mid. One close. Management doesnt check on or help you unless the health auditors are in the building. You have to be self sufficient. If you have anxiety this is NOT the place to work at Target.
bad,"No development from executives, given unrealistic goals.  The people who work there are the most enjoyable, hardworking individuals.  I loved my years there."
bad,They were always up our a** for the red cards and the breaks and lunches were given late. They dont care about the wellbeing of others expect if you met the daily goal.
bad,"Checked emails, printed out daily schedule, placed money in the registers, set daily RedCard goals, partner with the leader on duty for any unexpected changes. Executed plans and set goals for the team. What I learned is the importance of developing relationships and engaging with my team.The workplace culture was a Fast, Fun and Friendly environment. Hardest part of the job was having to let people go. Most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity in my work, the ability to develop and promote my team into leadership roles."
bad,"Did not get paid enough to deal with the b/s I dealt with on the daily. Made wonderful friends while working there, most of my coworkers I met through target are now life long friends but higher management is terrible. My store manager acted like a child and was extremely unprofessional and just weird. They cut hours and they never seem to get better. Job is great for someone who has no financial responsibility"
bad,"Working at Target includes a fast-paced customer service oriented environment that only slows for breaks and shift end, with interchangeable staff duties in all areas of a very large department store retail sales arena. As a team member at Target, I learned how to constantly connect with all parts of the store and staff for the purpose of customer service and sales. As an employee of Target, there is a strong emphasis on a broad spectrum of equality and contribution to community inside and outside of the workplace. The most difficult part of working at Target is working short-staffed in certain areas of the store, while trying to provide quality customer service. I enjoyed when Target participated in employee recognition and programs to encourage employees to be confident in their individual abilities to help achieve the goals of a team."
bad,"Management and the workplace was great, but the pay is minimum wage. In areas where I live, that salary simply doesn't cut it. I also applied with a specific job in mind, and got placed in a different position instead, a position I did not want to work at. This soured my opinion of the company right from the beginning. Decent if you want a starting job, but nothing more than that."
bad,"The job is pretty simple. Move boxes around. However, the upper management is always trying to change the processes of how you do your job. It doesn't have to be a bad thing, but their lack of knowledge of day to day operations really throws a wrench into productivity and the team member is the one that pays for it. The temperatures in the summer and winter change with with the weather. The heat is pretty adequate in the winter but the summers are scorching hot and humid. the warehouse fans do a poor job of providing comfort in these conditions. Constantly raising productivity expectations paired with strict safety rules force team members to choose between getting coached on safety violations or not hitting their numbers and then getting coached for that."
bad,"I started off with a wonderfully stern manager who would make sure each team member backed each other up. It started as a fun, extremely productive Flow team, to bickering, quitting, walking out on a manager that felt that 'fun' in a work place, meant that no one was busy. In actuality, it was a team that flowed together, that was kept quiet, no longer thanked. 'Fun' does not destroy moral. Self absorbed managers, do."
bad,"I didn't really feel welcome and I feel like whenever I was at work, I was simply thrown in a position that was unnecessary because there were already too many people on a shift. It was difficult to communicate with managers and having a job that literally requires you to walk around with a cart full of misplaced stuff all day gets boring."
bad,A typical day at work was slow and boring. Management was horrible and in consistent. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management. Most enjoyable part was my co-workers.
bad,"Too much pressure on a small team, expected to do way more work than our small team can actually manage. Often asked to stay late or come in on days off because we can't actually manage to get things done on time, even though the managers claim that they give us enough hours for our team to finish"
bad,"The holiday season was very busy."
bad,You end up working more than you get paid. Expectation levels are to high and leadership at higher level can’t be trusted. Employees come and go to quick when they realize the workload and expectations are to high for what they get paid
bad,"Target is an (ok) company to work with. If there was more caring management the company, then some stores would be more successful, crew members would be more happy about they're job."
bad,"Semi organized, not very advanced with the new features at other targets that I have been in. I’m guessing that’s because it was a small store. Outrageous expectations required in very small unrealistic time frame. Management was unprofessional and there was not enough communication between the managers and other team members. Not much training involved wasn’t taken very seriously, they kind of just put me on the floor and expected me to know most of what to do."
bad,"Target makes for a great first retail experience. They are very team oriented, but my management team had no input or willingness to push for efficiency"
bad,Majority of co-workers where amazing people. The management team was week and had very little to no knowledge of job or what it entailed.  They made working there very difficult.
bad,The management pressures you frequently through the day to sell credit cards. In fact they want you to always be pressuring customers to purchase a credit card and if you don't you'll end up fired.
bad,The work is very easy. The people you work with are great. Also the hours are very flexible. You also get discounts on everything once you begin your employment.
bad,"Target is only great if you have a great STL & DTL. The company itself expectations are impossible they want you to get so much done with limit amount of hours. In stores the company is really  struggling. In my opinion if the corporate side would be more realistic with their expectations from day to day maybe more people would stay and make Target their career. I do realize retail isn't for everyone, but being with this company burns you out."
bad,"Not much hours were given when scheduling was made. Lots of call outs or always under staffed. Very stressful at times, but Target Management always tired to much arrangement to better the circumstances, definitely improving."
bad,"This job has a lot of growth opportunities but also a lot of responsibility and demanding hours. Its a great stepping stone. "
bad,"Target was a decent company to work for.  The only thing with working for this company is, the environment can get a little fast paced and stressful during the holiday season, which is the time I started working there."
bad,"Poor management.  There wasn't any assistance. They hire inexperienced individuals straight out of collage with no personal or leadership skills. Many times you have unreasonable expectations assigned to you. Hours are continuously cut and Human Resources and Executive Team Leaders are found mostly in their offices, unwilling to interact with guests or help solve problems. I as a Team Lead consistently had to deal with too few of hours to allocate to my team- and still we made top scores out of our district (Starbucks). It is simply a shame I had to leave due to their neglect of the team and my own hard work."
bad,"working at target is very odd, your managers are unprofessional and they lazy. the customers are kinda rude and sweet. target cant keep employees because they hire everybody as seasonal.aqwm./"
bad,Lack of Logistical routine and stability led to failure of company with he Canadian potential.
bad,Company is good to work for manager at the time could have been more professional and equal to all employees in the work place ........................
bad,a good place to get a job at because you learn new stuff by each day but the management were not good to me beside the most enjoyable part were the customers.
bad,"They have no clue what they were doing it seems like. However, I was just a worker so most likely I am wrong, but place was like a zoo for the backroom team."
bad,"honestly the best part was the other people working there. co-workers were great, the work got pretty heavy at times and slow otherwise. Management was horrible and no type of benefits at all unless you work 40 hours a week average but the'll make sure to cut your hours when they need to so you don't reach that point."
bad,"A Typical day at Target is you have a morning meeting for the section you work in, which is good, you have little games and you have fun people to work with. the Manager was great she always had time to talk to and find out if you had any issues. I did not like that they put me somewhere else when I was hired I asked for a cashier job. I only worked on the registers when needed. They made sure you worked your hours and then were out. Did not like overtime except for the Holidays. I learned a lot while there, but preferred to work what I ask to work on application. Pay is low for what you do."
bad,"They had great pay but offered no overtime , they would fire you over it & had poor management . Would recommend only if you care about the pay and not the quality of your job."
bad,I did learn a lot working at target. i just can't deal with rude people.  i used to do backroom and price change which was ok but dealing with customers can be stressful.
bad,"Not a bad job if you""re either in highschool ,college, stay at home mom looking for money( low pay) you probably wont see more than 8.50 an hour and its difficult to move up."
bad,"It has a lot of room for improvement. If you can't find employment any where else, it is better than not working. It is good for college students and people who don't have families to support."
bad,It's a good place to work for. However it may be very busy to a point where the availability of people's hours may not be fully taken care of by managers. It can be hectic but the company is well taken care of and it's a very welcoming place.
bad,"As an ex-employee, the employee's or team members are the best, they are helpful when one is able to be friendly and helpful. There are different departments and the team members look out for each other. However the management was the worst, those TLs, ETLs or STLs are very demandful and do not help team members only when there are visits. The hours are cut and the team members with the best hours, wage increases, and advancements, only get them because they have connections with the managers."
bad,"Some managers are good, some are bad and its impossible to know which is which because they have a finely knit clique that try and fire employees when they do something they don't agree with. The work would be amazing if it weren't for REDcards. We were encouraged to even falsify Redcard applications for the sake of sales and to keep our scores up. Employees were encouraged to apply for credit cards on a regular basis so that we could reach goals for the week. 6101 N Keystone was the worst Target ever"
bad,"Target's slogan describes more than just it's virtue towards the customers, but also it's philosophy on how to handle it's workers. Increasing difficulties in the retail space have resulted in the company cutting back payroll significantly and cutting payroll exponentially. Few employees are expected to fulfill every role in the store and are harshly penalized if the task load is too large. The company does a great job at developing talent but also becomes far too political when trying to promote at higher levels."
bad,The job is easy but the management wanted to much from them employees at times. Also I was down to one or two days a week. The pay is very good for the job description though.
bad,Hours are awful. You are treated as a number and have no home life. They dont treat people equally and I had a baby and needed the weekend shift 12 hours cause i could not work 4p to 2 a and they were hiring new hires for the shift i wanted and needed and they wont offer inside the building they want you to benefit them 100% if not they fire you without cause.
bad,"A typical day at work in morning time was very slow, it was not much to do. During the afternoon and evening time the store was very busy and fast pace.."
bad,"Worked here for over two years. This company had health benefits and they were pretty good. They got rid of them a few months after I left and completely dissolved the overnight shift, which paid $1 more than day shift. Spervisors and management were good, except one who had a bloody stick up her butt."
bad,"Management was probably the biggest downfall of the store, as I had four different bosses with all different objectives for me throughout the day, which is usually something I can handle, however they all would not communicate clearly. The demeanor of working with two of the four head leaders of Target would make it almost a hostile work environment. However I did enjoy being in a fast paced environment, and enjoyed having extra responsibilities as it gave me the best work experience."
bad,I really liked my job. Management didn't really seem to know what was truly going on in there areas. Not a lot of appreciation. Different people got held to different standards. Not everyone was held equally accountable. I did like working for the guest and the team that I lead. The company seems like a good company. Just didn't like the store I was working for.
bad,It was a decent job with good pay but the managers were just over bearing and always trying to pick on every little thing you did. If you found a easier way to do things they would frown upon it and tell you to do it there way.
bad,"While this is probably one of the easiest and safest jobs you can have, upper management doesn't know how to manage people and business choices are poor."
bad,"Overall, this was a nice place to work, however directions and expectations were not consistent and unclear. I often found it difficult to fill the workday, and was often treated very differently from permanent employees."
bad,"I unloaded trucks using a variety of forklifts including a slip loader and clamp loader."
bad,"Working there was a good experience for me I enjoyed my job and I didn't know anything about unloading trucks, driving the stand up forklift and using a Telzon until I worked there, I started in Receiving from my date of hire until my exit, I did this for 15 yrs"
bad,"I would have loved to continue my employment with them, but after one mistake with their outdated scheduling process, I was put on probation the day before I was moving. Before this happened, I was planning on transferring my job to a Target that was close to me. The pay was good, the hours were good, the ability to pick up hours was as easy as asking someone for their unwanted hours. The management was poor because I had no clue who was my supervisor (or Team Leader) because it changed every single shift. It almost seemed like coworkers would show up the next day as team leaders! It was hard to keep up and take direction because they, themselves, didn't know what they were doing. Breaks were fair, as any other well-established company was."
bad,"I usually cutting a boxing , carry a box ,put out a cart and helping people .i was learning a lot , i know how to and I really want to work fast."
bad,"Save your time and energy, dont even think about applying here. yes the pay check is nice but is it worth it if you want to slap and cuss out almost every employee?  No. Although some employees are nice and friendly, most get out of line and act like they are managers."
bad,"Don't expect growth within the company."
bad,"Organization moved to 100% agile product teams - unclear roles and responsibilities.  in midst of major transformations so i think the company will come out on top but in the meantime, not the most fun place to work."
bad,"While my experience there was short, and I was usually over burdened with responsibilities. It provides a great starting point for a teenager in high school to get some work experience. After a year there it became clear that there was very little room for growth. Coworkers were very fun and nice, and there were lots of team activities. "
bad,I was a sales associate on my way to a team lead position. I learned quite a lot about managing team members and sets on the salesfloor. Management was understanding for the most past. Coworkers were a hit and miss.
bad,"Target Distribution used to be an awesome place to work.  They used to value the Fast, Fun, and Friendly culture that made the work environment very attractive to all employees.  Lately, the company has come under new management, and they lack any care for workers and both individuals and as a team.  The culture has diminished from a teamwork environment to that of iron fist micro-management.  The new supervisors are very inexperienced, they do not address concerns rather than hold grudges for constructive feedback, and they treat adults as mere children.  The pay is good for having only a high school diploma, but the stress of having misguided leadership is not even worth the pay.  Needless to say, Target is a mediocre place to work, and be prepared to be totally confused and stressed out EACH AND EVERYDAY!!!!"
bad,Worst company to work for. Everything is dirty and nobody checks the dates on food. I was only one who did anything. The only thing that was worth it was the friends I made.
bad,This job is not recommended for the long term as it is very stressful do to the amount of physical labor within a limited time span as well as staff on more then one occasion.
bad,Hated it I felt like they ddnt ike me because I was the only black person basically never appreciated anythng I did had a problem with everything
bad,Target is far better than Walmart when it comes to presentation however they're products are over priced. We as a team are told how much profit were making every month but no changes have been made to employees pay or benefits. There is too much middle management and not enough permanent workers to get the tasks finished. We have to 1 hour to get a truck unloaded before the store opens up so instead of having the logistic team work overnight we get in trouble for having products on the floor while people are trying to shop. I have learned the thrill of the sale. Some guest come to me for advice and I try to persuade them the purchase the most expensive item we have but if they're not trying to spend any money I would push them to purchase something so they don't leave empty handed. The hardest part of the job was either waking up at 4 am to unload a truck or the fact that we are so under staffed because of lack of pay no one wanted to stay. Over all I know its not my direct managers fault that things aren't going as efficiently as they could but as I mentioned earlier there is too much middle management.
bad,"Everday is the same old thing, nothing interesting to be intriged by, but what else can you expect from retail... They hire first time managers, so you know what that means. Poor choice... Theyre good on giving you breaks, as long as you ask for them, and making sure you take your lunch. A few of the managers are okay, but arent interested in how your department is doing if you need help. They are understanding if there are personal issues in your life and will offer you help through hot lines. They can be flexible with your schedule and understand that you have a life outside of work, but that means you will suffer with few hours. HR is extremely helpful and they offer free food and drinks in the break room on occasion-- always a nice surprise. Work as hard as you can and maybe they'll recognize your dedication once a year, unless you are handing out red cards, that is pretty much what you can expect. The best part of working here are your nice, regular customers and few friendly co-workers."
bad,"Started off good, I was told my number one job is to make sure that guest leave happier then when they arrived. the downside to this was, that management did not follow through with those protocols. they would assume and talk about guests being suspicious because they wanted refunds. and it was all about the numbers, how many red cards we got, the guest surveys. it was no longer about helping the guests, but rather about pleasing the management. very poor leadership from the management, not promoting a team environment, ousting new members in leadership, very top down which is not conducive to team building."
bad,Leadership is laid back but the work is very physical. Pay is good better than anything else without a degree but you will feel it at the end of the day.
bad,My typical day at work was okay. It was pretty busy on most days. Sometimes my days went by quick and other days were slow at times.
bad,"Understaffed due to high turn over rate. A lot of my co-workers quit or where fired, because HR would not be flexible with their schedules. Also, there were many occasions were the breakdown in communication was so bad no one had any idea what was going on. The company of Target is a very good company to work for, but the Towson Target needs a new HR department and new/better management. There were times that I was the only cashier from 8 until I got off. I was a part-time cashier that worked an average of 35 hours a week. Once school started again, they (HR) made it tremendously to change my schedule. One of the ETLs approached me and implied that I should focus in being a cashier instead of pursuing a college degree."
bad,Availability of hours is always playing around with your schedule on a daily basis and the pay was nothing compared to other retail stores offerings.
bad,mangement was horrible and it seems as if no one wanted to work there. we would unload the truck early in the morning then head to the sales floor to neatly put up items.my co-workers were great and fun to work with.
bad,"I'm not into stepping on people to get promoted and therefore, I quickly determined that the possibility of ever getting promoted were zero. "
bad,"I worked for Target Mobile, not Target. It was great when they were owned by RadioShack and I probably would have stayed if they never switched it to MarketSource."
bad,I used to love coming to work but now I dread it. The managers are not on the same page. Too many different rules and I can't work at a place where you are not promised an advancement. They cut hours and for me working for 5 years my pay doesn't show.
bad,"New manager has never worked in a machine shop, and constantly makes wild and crazy dead lines that were not possible. example.. need 30 tools out tomorrow no excuses... the issue would be that not all of the parts had been machined yet."
bad,"nothing great, just ok. im a manager here, long hours, and get yelled at a lot by guests"
bad,"Working as a cashier at Target seems pretty straightforward on the outset. But once you're hired, you find out all about their ridiculous REDCard program. Make no mistake: Target's entire business strategy hinges on and around this one flawed program. Cashiers have to peddle this program to every single customer, and they WILL fire you if you don't get many sign-ups (the required amount is >2.5% of however many notifications you receive in a week to sign people up. The more people you see, the more notifications you'll get, which means the more cards you'll need to sell in order to stay up to par week by week). "
bad,"Target is great if you're coming out of college heavy in student loans because they love college recruits and pay well.  However, there is zero work-life balance.  Your entire life will be consumed by Target.  Retention in management is atrocious and no one seems to care."
bad,"Working environment is very good and clean. "
bad,"help customers and stock the shelves well."
bad,"Nothing was ever typical while working at Target Corperation, in the first four years it was great. New exciting advancement oppertunitees, learning diferent departments, to work in. "
bad,"My typical day at work starts with reports and required tasks to get done on that day. I come in contact with at least 20 or more Team Members per day to answer questions they may have. I also look over applications submitted online, conduct orientations, and provide support to all team members as needed. "
bad,"I worked at a super target, most of my team leaders were great, but there were three who were so cocky about being on salary, kinda treated everyone like dirt and were always very loud. The ones who were great would always find a reason to buy food for the break room, but breaks were always 10-45 minutes late. There's lot of opportunity to move up, a lot of chances to pick up shifts. Everyone gets super crazy about having outs in your lanes and percent amazed and you have to ask every guest about the red card which gets super annoying for everyone involved."
bad,"Lots of room to grow if you want to do more with the company. Challenging environment that requires the ability to balance leadership with things like cashiering, taking out the trash, and helping guests find merchandise."
bad,"I guess Target is alright. I've worked in retail for almost a decade, and I'm burnt out by it. If you like working in grocery stores, I suppose you would like working at Target. The starting pay is low, and Target is virulently anti-union. I work at a lower volume store, so I never get full time hours. Target recently stopped offering health benefits to part time employees. Target will use and abuse you like any other big box retailer."
bad,"My coworkers were friendly and helpful, easy to work with. A typical day at work was long but not boring. The management was stiff, dehumanizing and hard to work with if your schedule needed adjustment. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping guests."
bad,"Very political management structure.  Fun though, I do miss some people."
bad,the small area of the retail store was easy to monitor and keep in order
bad,"dealing with the everyday customer and associate issues.  "
bad,slow workplace treated unfair didn't appreciate my work short breaks short hours
bad,"Most of the time working there was a pretty fun place. But when things got hectic and crazy, things REALLY got crazy. The lack of sleep got to a lot of people, so a lot of the times people called in sick which made things harder and put more stress on the others which in turn made other people call in. So in all it was a pretty harsh work environment."
bad,management is good.  hard to get steady hours.  Target just doesn't do regular full time
bad,The pay is not adequate for most employees to meet economic requirements and they tend to keep employees at minimal hours making it worse.
bad,"Overall the place isn't horrible. If you don't have a college degree then don't expect to do anything but work on the floor. You get ""fresh"" college grads to be your boss. I have worked in this type of industry for over 10 years and and have more experience than she ever will. So if you don't mind being on the bottom and capping out your pay in 2 years, then it may work for you."
bad,"Its a nice company to be involved in, people are friendly and respectful!"
bad,-good benefits and decent pay
bad,Doesn't interact with customers much. Supervisors are hardly around.
bad,cool place to work for younger people. not many hours to go around and the pay is not all that great but you have good benefits.
bad,Pay Rate is poor rate
bad,"Great starter job, I learned a lot. No room for advancement beyond team lead"
bad,"The only problem I had was I told management several times that I needed more training and it wasn't given to me. I didn't understand most of the job or how to read the planograms. Other associates helped me when they could, but management completely ignored my requests for additionaly training."
bad,"Depending in what store you work in that it will be considered Fast,Fun, and Friendly. You can learn a lot of things. Some of the management team are only worried about themselves ONLY. But if you love to be around all kinds of people...Then you can do it!!!"
bad,Target is a great American company but lacks a few major traits. Management sometimes can be a joke. At least at the store I worked at they all seemed to care about gossip and having favorites. They could pay their employess better for what we go through. The compensation is lousy.
bad,"Well to start off, the hiring process was a bit confusing. I was called in for an interview and was interviewed by one of the couple managers working there. After the interview, I was told that I would be hired part-time but before I left, HR told me I was to be hired as seasonal. At the time I didn't really care since I needed a job."
bad,I would still be working here if it wasn't for the non existing team work. The poor more management. The harassment and racial comments we're resolved  as well.
bad,"CONS:"
bad,"Good money but not worth it. It would be better to avoid at all costs. Their slogan is Expect More, Pay Less. They will expect a great deal from you but will not reciprocate."
bad,"The managers did not care to train new people on basically ANYTHING, but they sure as h*ll had mad orders to throw around at the new people. Everyone is for themselves and the workload can sometimes be too much for one employee, considering how many things have to get done by the end of the shift. Almost no room for breaks or error, always have something to do. Deserves better pay for employees for sure."
bad,"Company policy dictated a no-harassment policy, which was not honored.  Customers were allowed to verbally abuse cashiers.  Management did not warn any customer to stop abusing a cashier.  The hardest part of the job was continuing to give good customer service when a customer was screaming at you, and calling you names."
bad,I told them I needed specific days off but they gave me those days anyways. Didnt leave me in one department kept moving me around. They said they will keep me on a set schedule but ended up moving my hours everywhere.
bad,I worked for the mobile department and it was horrible. The pay was slightly ok for retail but good have been much better. The DM was horrible and would do malicious things towards the employees just because he wasn’t a fan of ours
bad,"This company give you only 4 hours per day , is a good company but only for people who need a part time job. Sometimes the manager they are bad persons , not everyone , is only some managers they are like that"
bad,"Most of the managers and people in charge is super nice. They are frequently  short on staff  yet they schedule you for 3h-5h, They shouldn't rely on past year revenue."
bad,"While working I was trying to go back to school, and management would not work with my schedule to ensure that I could potentially do both. I had to forgo going to school to make sure i would not be fired."
bad,"They are somewhat understanding with time off. The managers are just trying to look out for the company, not the employees. They hire a lot of people and only give a few hours."
bad,Management was atrocious. As a target security specialist I felt I was more of a store associate then anything else. You would think your job title was one thing when really it means everything. Don’t get me wrong I like helping out when I can. However getting yelled at because of the duties of my peers who are not of my position because I didn’t help them do there job is ridiculous. When I have a job to do my self
bad,"This was my first ever job, so as far as first jobs go it gave me experience and universal skills I can take anywhere. I learned many things during my two years working at Target such as interpersonal skills, autonomy, and teamwork."
bad,Target is only good if you are interested in working in retail hours are rough to work around and environment is very difficult and it was in the curb of chicoak
bad,"They had me working a 4-hour shift every other week at six in the morning. I made $44 each paycheck. I was unloading the refrigerated trucks, not worth $88 a month."
bad,"Work life balance does not exist at Target. As with any retail chain, its all about perception. Store visits are dog and pony shows and leadership just wants to see full shelves and no reshop. Problem is that there isnt enough payroll to clean up the stores appropriately or staff the registers at the front end so customer experience suffers."
bad,I have a physical disability that was not worked with. I ended up being ignored in the end and couldn’t get a hold of HR. I was never officially let go but I still have my employee discount
bad,It was good at first but after some mangers left and we got new one they treated us bad or tried to over work people. They would find little ways to write people up as well so they could get fired.
bad,Most of the time management would argue amongst each other on scheduling and disciplinary  actions. They had favorites and grudges against workers. Not recommended.
bad,I did not like working at target. I feel like they really don't care about their lower level employees. And the management often has no idea what is going on.
bad,"when there are issues it is always someone else's fault management did not show much ownership when there were issues, felt like there was no one to turn too for help"
bad,"It is great at first. However after sometime you will see favorites and there are some people who are treated different based on a physical appearance, if you catch my drift. They can be flexible but only if they think it's reasonable. If they know you're a good worker they will sometimes not try to accommodate for an availability change."
bad,"no job security, the managers care more about their own role and making money than the satisfaction of their employees. pay is very low for the amount of work they expect"
bad,There are so many teams at target but no team help other teams when needed. The job description is confusing and not direct. They want more then they are willing to offer pay wise. They have employees that Have been working for years and do not let them know to apply for a higher up position if they have the qualifications.
bad,This is a good company to work for if they just treat their employee with some respect. How am i suppose to pay for my bills on a 8 hours a week? Also they hire a bunch a people so they don't have to give you benefits it really sucks because this is a multi billion dollar company.
bad,"My coworkers at target were either odd or super nice, but the lower-level management often were power-hungry and super hard to work with. Overall, the job was easy, but the management made it harder than it should have been."
bad,Working at target really helped me discover my strengths and weakness. I've gained alot of knowledge and resources that can advance me to more opportunities in life. Management is a little tough but manageable. The hardest part is really needing a strong mentality.  The enjoyable part of my job was being able to work in a diverse area. My department was the most diverse and well balance of personality.
bad,"very fast paced, they require you to unload the merchandise truck as fast very time restricted and stock shelves and backstock sometimes faster than humanly possible"
bad,"They hired me on at a late stage in pregnancy, knowing I'd be leaving shortly to care for a newborn. Had full intention of going back, but the manager at the time was incredibly rude and expected things of me she knew I was unable to do. Then expected my coworkers to avoid doing their jobs to help me with mine, instead of picking up what I wasn't able to accomplish in the morning. I would get in trouble for staying 30 minutes late in order to fulfill my tasks. I loved the job itself and my coworkers, but my superiors made it complicated and unenjoyable."
bad,"I worked as a cashier for a few years. The job itself is pretty easy: just ring up customers, clean/organize the cash lanes as needed, complete any other tasks assigned by manager. What I hated most though was selling the RedCard (store credit card). RedCard sales are the defining factor of success for everyone, from the cashier, to the manager, to the store itself. It is encouraged that a cashier sells at least one RedCard every 200 transactions, and the managers can be very pushy. Some managers use incentives (raffle drawings, free lunch, etc) to encourage cashiers to sell RedCards, but others may use coaching instead. If you don't sell enough, they relegate you to self check-out, where it's nearly impossible to sell RedCards, which means you dig yourself into a hole deeper and deeper. Other times, managers retaliate by cutting your hours. This RedCard environment became more toxic year after year I was there, hence why I left."
bad,This company was job was super stressful.  I had so many tasks to do and not enough time to do them.  I put clothing back out in the store and straightened clothing and shoes for all departments.  I also worked at the cash register.  I put items on the shelf to restock the shelves.  I found no time to complete all of these jobs.  I felt overwhelmed most of the time.  I did not have benefits because I only worked part-time.  I didn't understand why the supervisors needed to constantly stand over the workers and talk to them on walkie talkies to communicate every second you were working.  I felt like people should be able to do their jobs on their own.  The salary was $10.00 an hour in Hawaii.
bad,At target your hours will flux every week. Most of the time they won’t hire within the store. No advancement in position. Most are in over there heads
bad,"the best thing about this place are the people, the Management and higher up preach a different story, but when it comes down to it, the more lazy you are the better you are treated, if you actually do your job and follow the rules, your screwed. I know sounds messed up right! sadly its true!! management sucks and they have no idea what they are doing, then blame you, for their shortcomings"
bad,I got a job interview at 12 pm. I waited for someone to come an interview me for a while. Finally after waiting we began the interview process I was asked 4 questions. Then 6 minutes after the interview was over I received an email stating that I was not selected. How do you know I’m not qualified for a job if you asked me 4 questions? I felt like the interview was a complete waste of my time. I wasn’t given any feedback as to why I didn’t get the job.
bad,"Fed up with certain parts of management, everything else is fine but it totally ruins the work experience, the work is often stressful but tolerable, but can often be pushed overboard depending on how the leaders act."
bad,"I personally don’t like working for target because i feel as if they don’t really care about their employees. They don’t have flexible hours like they say, they don’t listen or care about the work that you do, as long as EVERYTHING gets done."
bad,My experience at Target wasn’t wasn’t what I thought it was going to be but The job was easy and the team members were nice but the job was long and the
bad,Target is wack job to work it’s cool if it’s your first job but the Management is hella unprofessional. They don’t give you enough hours to work and you can be a hard worker they don’t care. HR doesn’t know anything
bad,they make you do a lot of work but with very little pay. Most of the management is terrible and don't do any work. The positives of this job is the discount and the co workers that you get to work with.
bad,"The pay is very good, and probably the only saving grace of working for Target. How many hours you and your store get per week is based largely on a lottery system, which means one week you may get 40, and the next you may only get 15. My Target very often had me unloading entire trailers of refrigerated goods by myself, something that was not in the job description, and for which I received very minimal training and no additional benefits. District supervisors and members of corporate often make decisions arbitrarily, that end up hurting both store profits, and the employees. The job itself is tiring and boring, but not entirely bad, considering the pay. The deep structural problems within the corporation is why I would not recommend anyone work there for longer than a few months."
bad,I liked most of my managers but the shift leaders on night shift are terrible all they do is wait until the managers leave & run things their own way making it impossible to get your work done & then you get wrote up for it... I was given a week to show improvement or get fired for things that were out of my control basically from just doing what I was told & Then those night shift leaders will make you look bad to keep the heat off of them...I quit because it wasn’t worth the stress of working nights
bad,"Workplace politics and favoritism are abundant in this store.Management acts as though this is the only job in town and you are lucky they even gave you a chance. Absolutely no respect is given to new employees. New employees are given the grunt work while the veteran employees gossip and wander about the store. No room for advancement, low pay, pig headed managers and Hours are not consistent and not a job you could live or get by with. You can have 40 hrs one week and 15 the next."
bad,The target I worked at was not open to taking care of lower management or their employees...the executive team was always a priority and they always were double standards between them and the employees..the majority of the time the executives were in their offices directing orders as opposed to making their presence on the floor and working with the team. The turnover was very high...
bad,"Target has really taken a turn for the worse. Shopping there is great, working there is an absolute nightmare. Target has become far too corporate and is focused on making each target fit a cookie cutter mold that simply does not work for every Target across the board. Each facet of work at Target will differ store to store and they treat the small stores as if they are large stores, but give the small store less hours to get it all done. It is absolutely ridiculous and I have never hated a job more than I have working for Target."
bad,Alot of overtime. Manager I had was very rude. Fast paced hd to meet production goals. benefits were about average for this type of job. pay was good. Never knew where u were going to be working. Alot of favortism
bad,"I was hired as a GSTL (guest service team lead). I had years of customer service/management experience but zero experience at Target. When I was hired they told me I would have to do 2 weeks of training at a different location that was actually over a 40 minute drive both ways. While at that location I was barely trained with the person who was supposed to be training me and spent the majority of the time with that locations GSTL’s assistants. When I finally finished training my partner quit a month later (she was supposed to continue training me). I also had no supervisor over me (they were in the process of finding someone). For weeks I had no one to continue training me or help me. A lot of the leaders for the other departments of the store were very frustrated with me but I had really only had 2 weeks of training to begin with. I tried to ask as many questions as I could but of course everyone was extremely busy doing their jobs. About a month and a half of being there I saw 6 other leaders/assistants quit. Then I came to work one day to the news that our store manager had been fired. I was promised over and over that they were going to hire me a partner to run the front (this was a super target) and a boss, and it never happened. This specific location was supposed to have an executive GSTL, 2 GSTLs and 4 assistants, I was the only GSTL and only had 3 assistants and we did not have anyone to ask questions or guide us at all. HR and other store leaders would constantly criticize us but NEVER had any answers or help for us. I quit a little over 3 months of working there and"
bad,For students or a seasonal part time job it might be ok. It's better than Walmart but I wouldn't consider Target if you were looking for a serious career in retail unless you were really desperate or have access to a very high position with good benefits.
bad,The store itself ran like a mad house. There is such a quick running into each other to make the cut off time for unloading and stocking the shelves. There was no actual training for the position they just threw you on and had the other associates fill you in the best the could while also having to fulfill there job requirements. Hectic and not organized.
bad,"Target expects flawless continuous hard work and underpays cashiers. The pay is not worth all the work you put in. It is almost impossible to move up in the company unless you have worked there for over 10 years. The management pushed all the work on the cashiers, stockers and sales associates."
bad,They needed to hire more people. The staff had favoritism and didn't have a flexible schedule with getting time off or switching your hours. I did not like it personally. I gave it 2 stars because I met a great friend.
bad,"You are expected to be talked down to by customers (whom are referred to as ""guests"") daily and to take it with the self loathing smile of a dunce.  The vast majority of team leaders and executive level management are green behind the ears, do nothing, passive aggressive crabs in a bucket looking for any way to pull themselves up at your expense.  You WILL be assumed to be both ignorant and incompetent by customers and management alike. "
bad,Great choice for students or those with more flexible scheduling. Management was poor at best. Scheduling would change drastically from week to week with no consistency (be prepared to work most weekends). Miscommunication between mangers and team members. Constant problems arising from personal drama being brought into the workplace. Low pay/weak benefits.
bad,"I worked at the Pinellas Park location for about a year and it was the worst store I have ever worked at. The management wasn’t friendly, the other employees weren’t welcoming, and overall it just was a miserable place to work. Management didn’t take into consideration if you wanted to expand your skills into different departments."
bad,Its an alright job if you just need a job. Most people arent very happy working there. And i wasnt either. Its an inbetween job not a life long work place.
bad,Target was an awesome great first job opportunity. I learned a great deal from target. It was an awesome great first job experience. Working nights was a great way to learn new skills
bad,"poor management, but good pay. I made good friends at my location and enjoyed my job but I felt like some managers (LODS) did not care about your overall well being. Too much drama too"
bad,Loved this job until the management team started showing favoritism and that they pick and chose who they wanted working there and who they did not for whatever personal reasons they did or did not want someone to continue working there
bad,no clear communication and management that doesn't care about you. Job changed constantly because different people would say different things and i never knew what i was supposed to be doing.
bad,"The overall experience at this particular Target makes me never want to go back as a worker. I loved the work I did. Setting up planograms, presenting the merchandise to the customers and it felt great to do so, but what I didn't love was the management. Over time you really get an understanding of how much this store lacks communication and leadership. Most higher ups were considered unreliable and this store has a relatively high turn over even in management. Know why? Because they never properly train anybody and frustration sky rockets. I will never forget how many new hires came up to me asking questions and weren't told correctly or accurately beforehand. I will never forget the days of feeling so unappreciated for my work and feeling little respect or appreciation. The main focus is on sale goals understandably, but the feeling of respect for your job? Forget about it. The hours shift and quite honestly there are weeks where you're looking at a range between 40 hours between 30, but then they could also drop down to 15 hours. The ONLY thing positive about this place was my team and the people I worked with. They made the days feel less stressful and awful. Before putting in my 2 weeks I was offered the position of TL (team lead). Let me tell you, the stress and money isn't worth it for here."
bad,"Corporate has a heavy hand on the goings ons of the store front, but don't seem to know what it's like at bottom level. The changes come so often and drastic that it causes chaos. It stresses out the management staff, who then put extra pressure om those below them. The pay isn't worth the emotional stress. The pay isn't worth much honestly."
bad,Even if you give a 2 weeks if you don’t or are unable to finish it you won’t be eligible for rehire I even let a manger know there’s a chance I might not be able to finish after I handed a written two weeks and she said okay I did one weekend shift but wasn’t able to make my last one I got off too late for my merchandiser job 4 years later I reapply and find out I’m not eligible for rehire even though it let me apply again and said hr would contact me unless you know you will finish your two weeks by working ALL the days don’t apply here
bad,I don't like the hours and my current positions. They won’t let me breath or have plenty of flexibility. The store is also understaff making the work environment very difficult to work in.
bad,"If you're scheduled you cannot call out for funerals. that's not a company looking out for employees. Its a good job, for a 16 year old. Not a 27 year old."
bad,"when i first started at target a little over 2 years ago it was a relaxed place to work, then it started getting much stricter and the rate of production we have to hit in the functions went way up despite not making the job any easier and they implemented rules to impede on the job functions in order to make the job safer."
bad,Lots of discrimination behind the scenes. Felt as if this was a play job and had drama as if it were high school. I would absolutely not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"I worked at this company over a decade ago for a few years, but obviously my time at another company means that I don't have much to say about modern Target work environments."
bad,they schedule only 8 hour shifts and they have favorites. feel like some workers judge and overall its a pretty boring work environment. the register is not too easy.
bad,I experienced some great years with them. I hope the best for this company :-). I would definitely recommend this store to someone looking for a starter job to gain experience.
bad,"Purporting to want to change the company culture to a more inclusive, open and honest one where they embrace change but in reality it is a company obsessed with money and costs with very weak senior management."
bad,Worked for this company seasonally... there way of “letting go” of seasonal employees is disgraceful!!! I drove 30 minutes in the snow on New Year’s Eve for them to tell me I’ve bwen terminated for no real reason other than they already have too many employees. What kind of nonsense is that??? Poor management. Managers were mean and rude. 10/10 would not recommend to a friend.
bad,"I worked at 4 different Target locations and I really only enjoyed one. The atmosphere was great and I loved my coworkers, but it often seemed as if the higher level management would make decisions without thinking them through and then blame the team members when the idea failed."
bad,"In this highly technical, fast-paced, and challenging position, you'll collaborate with multidisciplinary team members to provide the very best care for our patients. The Patient Care Assistant is to transport patients to and from the unit(s), and also provide other support services to the patients and professional staff."
bad,Working for Target was a great starter career while in college.  They worked around the changing college schedule.  Down side retail and holidays were difficult and often draining
bad,Management is horrible. My manager didn’t care about anything but production. It’s all about numbers  numbers. If you don’t have daycare services for Saturday’s set up I advice you don’t get a job here because mandatory OT is MANDATORY OT and they could care less.
bad,I worked as a graduate intern at Target and learned a lot about becoming a pharmacist there.  The varied experience reinforced my decision to become a pharmacist.
bad,"many situations in which i was put down for not accomplishing tasks that were above me."
bad,"Other than the relationships I garnered with coworkers at Target I did not feel very recognized.  My immediate supervisor did poorly at her job, and would regularly take breaks that were way over the time limit with HR employees leaving me alone to do the work of two people.  My equals in target were great and made the job bearable.  Much of the upper management was kind, but during my time their my supervisor's supervisor changed quite often leaving confusion in their wake.  I learned how to work extremely hard with little recognition, but the job gave me a strong sense of the retail world and how corporations treat employees."
bad,With target you work either 10-12 hour shifts. The day goes by very quickly with different tasks that need to be completed throughout each work day. Before you know it your 10 or 12 hour work day goes by fast.
bad,"It has been a long time since I worked for this company.  They had great training, the culture was rough, it was retail.  There is only so much you can expect."
bad,I have been working on and off for Target for the pass six years. I learned a lot about Customer Service and working under pressure. Working a target taught me to be patient
bad,"Enjoyable to work with kids and parents"
bad,I don't like it. It's like highschool.   No room for growth. It is not about what you know it is about who you know. Never any stable hours. You can apply for full time and only work 10 hours a week.
bad,"Target really could have been a great place to work. On a day to day as HR I was able to interact with and support a large team. I had the opportunity to motivate, develop fun events and community service initiatives as well as participate in fundraising opportunities. "
bad,"I was literally the best worker there , was also seasonal , i don't understand why they dropped me when they told me that they were going to keep me. I like target but the managers were mean."
bad,"The company does not pay its employers enough for the amount of work. "
bad,"Target was a fun place to work at first, but the hours never increased and people who would work there for 4 months would get more hours than people who worked there for 4 years."
bad,Working at Target was okay for a while until they got new managers. The whole place is micromanaged and your work goes unappreciated. All they care about are the sales of red cards and I really don't feel like they truly care about their team members.
bad,I am trying to find a new job now I don’t think target is for me however they have went to starting pay at 12 dollars a hour but they never let anyone work over 25 hours unless you pick up other people shifts and working 25 hours doesn’t qualify you for insurance
bad,"There's a reason why I see the listing for a beauty floor associate at Target every time I look at job listings..."
bad,"Great job but if the staff decides to not like you, prepare for the worst. Pays great. Avoid working with food at all costs. Cashiering is great and somewhat structured"
bad,"The work we had to do was definitely manageable and not too bad. Most days I was able to finish all my work and go home on time. But as time went on, the management  grew more and more incompetent and unorganized."
bad,You came in to unload an 18 wheeler to bowl out merchandise to the different area's I loved helping customers and I worked in every area as well as Cashier Switchboard Operator
bad,The team members are friendly and easy going towards other team members. Team Leads and Team Exs keep changing how store is operated one day to another so hard to keep up with their demands for performance.
bad,"Target is how you would expect a grocery store to be, slow paced and a drain on both your physical and mental well being. It does pay well, for a superstore chain, but that may just be compensation for emotional distress."
bad,"Liked the management at the time, wasn't getting enough hours so found a better job. Was cross trained in different areas, enjoyable environment at the time"
bad,This job was rough. The managers were on and off.  Generally working here my morale was always really low.  The pay was good but not worth the drain of you energy.
bad,"Buena empresa con una cultura laboral buena, hay apertura al crecimiento laboral y pues se aprende mucho de las experiencias de los compañeros."
bad,If you live with your parents and need a job it is great. This is not a job that provides anywhere need what someone needs for a living wage in the area. This is due to a variable raise system and highly inconsistent hours.
bad,"Since the new management came into the warehouse a few months ago, life there has become harder for everyone. People are getting fired for almost anything and people are quitting because there isn't enough hours for full time employees and the management really doesn't seem to care about the employees. You have 3 to 4 night managers that will all tell you something different and they keep getting changed out and moved around every few months; so nothing stays the same."
bad,milk cheese salad pastas bread butter detergent mirror games tv underwear eggs bacon sausage juice chips pretzels cookies soda water drawers tshirts toys blankets sheets
bad,"The location I worked at had nice coworkers but the team leaders and managers were a different story. They would give me no choice but to agree to coming in on my off days, then for months I was getting 40 hours a week despite talking to them multiple times about being in school. It wasn't even season or close to major holidays. There was no work/life balance at all. They made me feel mislead a lot and I wish I had quit sooner."
bad,"A lot of managers to report to, it gets confusing. Scheduling is unfair and inflexible. Constantly on your feet. Only 10% off is given for employees. But pays well."
bad,"Working at Target is stressful they are not flexible with schedules, they put more work on you and give u less pay. Getting 40 hours a week is not likely."
bad,"Management always scheduled me outside of my availability as a minor. Job itself was easy, with a laid-back dress code and management. Just highly unorganized for such a large, national company. Lots of free food, though."
bad,Very fast paced job that requires constant motion. This is the perfect job if you like to stay busy. The shift starts at 4am so it requires getting up early but you leave early as well so it balances out.
bad,It depends on your manager as to how much support you have and which store you're placed.  Each store only has 1 facilities manager no matter the size and you have no support team.  The pay is competitive and the schedule is nice.
bad,I was a part-time employee so really have not got lots to say about this company. It was minimum wage. I was not with them very long as they did not succeed in Canada.
bad,Decent work enviornment but early hours and quick paced. Great for those whating a physically demanding job  also has discounts for all target employees
bad,"Poor management, low work hours for part time workers who are not team leads, pressure to sell read cards to every guest, No job growth, Needs better audits on management"
bad,"Management was poor, and by time they let me go for standing up for something that wasn't right they had got fired for theft of money. and stealing out of the store."
bad,"At Target I was a member of the Flow Team which would unload the"
bad,it was a great place to work in the beginning. towards the end they expected to much out of me for the little resources i had.but over all a great place to work if you need some extra cash or if you are getting back on your feet.
bad,"Putting price's on merchandise or restocking floor. Making sure we document all merchandise that was lost, stolen or broken. Restocking backroom with new merchandise."
bad,"It is a very stressful place with low pay, physically demanding job. Manager staff does not care about their employees and try to keep all workers at low hours to avoid paying benefits."
bad,"A typical day at work includes greeting customers, making sure the store looks clean, stocking shelves, and assisting customers. The management was pretty good but i didn't actually enjoy the job itself because of how much stocking i had to do. It's honestly not a bad place to work at but the job just wasn't for me."
bad,"After working at a Target store for two and a half years I finally decided to leave mostly due to poor management but a close second would be lack of hours. The management could use some work i.e. some LOD's could be more respectful to her team members and actually hear them out when we need certain days off instead of blindly ignoring team members. Hours could be more fruitful of course as store sales did dictate how much we worked i.e. its the holiday time of the year and yet I still received only 20 hours a few weeks during that time of year. A typical day at work for me would be clocking in, signing out equipment and then meeting with a LOD or team lead about the game plan for the day/night. Depending on your LOD/team leader the workload will vary. I learned a lot of different roles of the store ins and outs and there is and I mean A LOT of different things. I worked there for two and a half years and just this past holiday season and I learned a lot of new things. The hardest part of the job is getting assigned several (usually 5-6) tasks to be completed ""before you leave today"" which does not work out well if I would be the only one working this closing/morning sales floor shift which does not pair well with responding for fast service, helping guests and covering other team member breaks while the LOD(s) eats a guacamole dip in the break room and dictates over the walkie-talkie with a mouth full of food."
bad,A decent job with decent pay. A great start up/supplemental job. You can meet new people and form friendships with coworkers and the community. Not a bad place.
bad,"Worked there for over 2 years.. Did not like the new ETL. She did not care for anyone but herself, and anything you'd have known before her was wrong."
bad,"hours inconsistent, management uncompassionate, not enough pay, not enough opportunity to advance in company, favoritism, not enough benefits, no free food unless Black Friday"
bad,I liked the job because it was fast paced and I was able to interact with different people all the time.They didn't give hours to all the people who really wanted to work.
bad,"I enjoyed the job and worked hard with the Team to improve results in our area. It was sold as a ""Fast, Fun and Friendly"" Company and it is not. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a difference in what I worked on. It was a bit of a stressful environment and layoffs were involved."
bad,"Going in at twenty I didn’t expect to work at Target for an extended period of time. What followed were the four best years of my professional career. You not only get to work with a wonderful team, but you get the chance to prove yourself. A lot of promotions are done in-house."
bad,an ok job for younger people looking to make a decent starting wage but not a great place for growth. managers often push cashiers and team members to sell credit cards but provide no finical incentives.
bad,They hire way too many people and don't have enough hours to give to new people they hire. They really pressure you to get red cards. They fired one girl without even telling her up front. She had to call into the store to find out why she was no longer on the online schedule.
bad,Management is okay however could be better. There is not much compassion for team members and their situations. Def not enough pay for the amount of work put in
bad,"Working at target warehouse, you have to have your mind made up because , it is not an easy job , your on your feet 24/7 and your.  Constantly  packing and pushing boxes"
bad,"The pay sucked. Leadership did not lead, instead they gossiped. There was no communication between leadership and the staff. The schedules were always inconsistent."
bad,"This job is ok, if you need a quick part time job then maybe you would like it. Hard work with low pay and benefits. I would not recommend my friends of family to work here."
bad,"It was a Seasonal Temporary Job. In hopes to gain a job position at the end of the term. It was a good chance to get my foot in the door. In the end, I did not get hired as a permanent for the position."
bad,Wouldn't recommend working here. The work environment was poor and stressful. Lacking management would not hold all workers to same standard. Long hours led to no personal time.
bad,"Rather than promotions being given for hard work or based on previous skills/experience of a candidate, Target instead seems to promote entirely based on who you know.  As a result, many employees tend to spend large portions of their work day going to ""status"" or going to network with people over coffee instead of focusing on their actual job duties."
bad,"If leadership was better at Target then one could "
bad,"you grow a lot of patience and you work at a fast paced , target didn't really teach me anything that i didn't already know  my self, but it was a working progress i started off seasonal and became permanent"
bad,"I unfortunately had a bad experience with this job. It started out great, but then we had a change in management. The new manager played favorites a lot. Now this does not mean that it is a bad company to work for. I just happened to have someone that made it an unenjoyable workplace after I had already been there for 2 years."
bad,Its was ok just to many people telling you what to do overnight team that i was on had to help out other teams and maintain our team goal as well. Long hrs no fresh air
bad,I would recommend this job to an individual way before I would recommend them to wal mart... If only target had the benefits as walmart has then it would be the perfect retail job.
bad,"ok place of employment, not so good hours, management is so-so depending on what store you get. logistics is not a hard job, mostly just stocking shelves."
bad,"this is a decent job it you  enjoy working retail. The hours are usually unstable depending on your job title. Additionally, the customers are usually rude."
bad,"This place is all about production and pushing to meet the numbers. Yes they talk about safety and the right way to do things. Training is a joke and isn't taken seriously. Very easy to get hurt here moving 450+ boxes an hour. Team can work together at times and against each other at other times. Nothing is balanced between workers, sometimes you will be doing a lot of work non stop. Very very hot summers, very unsafe. This job will work you no problem at all."
bad,"I do not recommend working here.  Very, very hard, trying, and unreasonable.  They do not care about the health and safety of their employees.  All you'll find here is stress and injury."
bad,"Very stressfull. Was placed into a supposed ""temporary"" position and then basically taken advantage of and kept in that position because of my previous experience in that position. There were always new hires for the position I was promised when hired."
bad,lack of leadership and management. would cut work hours randomly without giving reason. management was very childish. the hardest part of the job was not knowing what you schedule was going to be so weeks.
bad,It was horrible working at target the manager had horrible communication skills with people. He felt like he was better than everyone really made people uncomfortable and didn't want to talk to him.
bad,"Poor Management.  No customer service given to patients. I was told I wasn't there to talk to customers while we had nothing to do, and I am very much a people person,"
bad,"had a decent time there but had problems with getting to much work and not enough people to do it but still got the work done and some , had some great leaders but needed better ones"
bad,"I love to shop at target, however I hated working there. We constantly had to push red cards and they would pull you into a room and push that you need to offer it to every customer. Really kind  of annoying which made me dislike working as a cashier. However the mangers mostly were nice."
bad,Promotions were not based on performance or production. Minorities  were given preference. I do not recommend this company as either an employee or consumer.
bad,"It's a very aesthetically pleasing place to work and customers are often very polite, although management was always jumbled and made working very difficult. Having too many direct managers with conflicting ideas and not enough communication on radios."
bad,"a lot of redcard promotion, kind of got annoying after a while.The managers kind of rude and snotty but I guess it was an okay job. to each his own..."
bad,I started there as an seasonal employee and I was glad to be let go after. I've never noticed until working there how messy and irresponsible people can be in the store.
bad,"This was a job based on time management team building organization and customer service skills. As well as being a team player, team leader, and problem solver."
bad,"Productive place to be, it is busy so you are serving guests, or answering questions taking returns or payments.management was good.Had a fun and nice environment."
bad,Working for Target has changed how a view the retail world. The second largest retail company in the country and treat employees unfairly. No wonder T
bad,"High expectations, low pay. Starting pay is $10 /hour. Small opportunities for growth. Little recognition for good work. Very few hours available to work. Benefits available and flexible scheduling. Managers are overworked and pressured which trickles down to sales associates."
bad,"Working back room at target is the hardest job there, Management is constantly on you. A lot of work in a little time and I've also seen people come and go at least 5 times a month."
bad,this is an OK place to work. good for a starting job but i cant imagine working here for longer than 6 months. Working weird shifts and not a set schedule is hard to work around.
bad,Target is fun to work at if you are in your desired position. My only complaint is that I requested to be cross trained several times. I was unhappy with having only one skill and when I set up a meeting to discuss another position I was disregarded.
bad,"Target was a great place to work while it was still open in Canada. Training was very detailed and thorough, staff was always welcoming to new workers and customers."
bad,"Target is a very demanding company with good opportunity for development but lack of benefits in store to store interactions, also  there is a lack of ownership for store leaders with responsibilities and current role at the location I was in."
bad,It was us against them all the time. They weren't willing to work with other job schedules. The management teams were full of crude people who got to their position through connections and never did anything after they got a new position.
bad,"the enviroment comfortable and facilities is better."
bad,"as a fellow employee there I worked there for little over a year and not only did they bring me in for the bottom dollar amount, the 1 raise I got was only like 15 cents. hard work definetley does not pay off there"
bad,"There's no possibility for advancement unless you get a bachelors, and they still probably won't hire you for management. I was fired for voicing my opinion and the official reason was cause I ""leaned"" on a piece of equipment. Safety violation"
bad,"Great job to have as a career, wonderful co workers, lots of opportunity involved with the job I enjoy the pace the environment, I would love to work for this company again"
bad,"The work was honest and wasn't too extensive, the pay was more than what the work was worth in my opinion. The management was rather disappointing, their style of managing included barking orders from the break room instead of cooperating with the employees."
bad,Being a retail company. it is an excellent place to learn about retail . the technology being used is also good and latest. The experience gained at this company is pretty good.
bad,haven't worked there in years so I don't know how it is now. when I was there the store leader sucked. but worked with some good guys.
bad,I enjoyed working there and it was a good experience for me because I didn't know how to drive a forklift or use a Telzon until I worked there.
bad,It was an okay place to work at. Could of got treated better then what they did. They pick favorites there and talk about other peoples business to other co workers.
bad,Typical retail. If you did well socially in high school you will fit right in. You will be mirco manage at this job. I have learned a lot about retail here though.
bad,"this was my first job, didn't really know to much about it, but as i learned more i became a great asset to the company, move up fast as a high school student, due to my ambition and hard work."
bad,It is an okay place to work if you like working in retail. You will not get full time work unless you are trained to do 2 or 3 different jobs within the company or you are a Team Lead or Manager. It is a minimum wage job with raises occurring annually based on performance.
bad,Fast fun and friendly .. had to be the easiest job .. had fun but it' gets frustrating sometimes with chemical spills or people messing up shelves after you just corrected them
bad,Management is great but when it comes to scheduling it's not so great. Upbeat and great attitudes from most everyone. You get the chance to learn a lot of different departments.
bad,"I did like working here at first, but after new leaders came in they kind of ruined that store. They had no idea how to do their jobs, made the store a mess, and treated their employees very poorly. After awhile I really started to resent that store and couldn't deal with them anymore."
bad,"Most of the time it has to be a fast paced work environment to make up for people who lack a sense of urgency. Given the amount of workload, deadlines, and number of people we currently have, expectations from managers can be unrealistic. Co-workers who are oblivious to what's going on can be the hardest part of the job. After a month on the job, a new employee should have enough knowledge to know what's going on. Co-workers who I can rely on and ask very little from are the most enjoyable. Unfortunately, the reliable ones have all left. At the end of the day, it can get exhausting."
bad,"A typical day at work would be answering multiple phone calls and find a solution to the problem. I enjoy finding solutions, but do not enjoy being on the phone."
bad,"As soon you walk in, there are people who feel like they are superior to you, due to their title and it is favoritism in the workplace."
bad,Work environment was ok could've been better managers killed moral. The man that hired me quit weeks later. Says enough.
bad,"The best part of working for this company is they truly let YOU be YOU. Anything goes as far as hair, tattoos, & piercings. They are also very punctual with breaks & lunches. They pay is not great, but you do get regular raises."
bad,"I'm not going to lie, I dealt with harassment, and attitudes from coworkers, and people that were in charge, and favoritism amongst workers."
bad,Not great. The management is no existent. Just a more attractive Walmart catering to the upper middle class and the like. I would be hesitant.
bad,"This is pointless review as they no longer operate in Canada,  They messed up their supply chain badly couldn't stock the shelves the rest is history."
bad,"While Target is a wonderful corporation, the management at the West Melbourne Target is quite poor, leading to a lot of drama and inappropriate emotional manipulation from the managers to the employees.This could be a great job, but the lack of care from the leaders leads to a stressful and even emotionally draining environment."
bad,Target was great to work for. I loved the customer service and the environment. The pay was decent. the hours were okay too
bad,Its boring because your not productive you just stand there for most of the time. The pay is 9.25 and the commission isn't that great unless you work less hrs and get more sales
bad,it is an ok place to work. hours are inconsistent. the people are okay. the  pay is good. the employeers did not really care about the employees personal life and situations as to why they could not make it in to work that day
bad,"After working for this company for many years, the hardest part of the job was its professionalism. None of the managers really cared about the employees nor did they take their job seriously."
bad,"Overall, John Deere was a good place to work.  It allows you to learn a lot about the business world while at the same time figuring out what you want to do for a career."
bad,Do your task and leave. Never become too friendly with the team members here. Everyone is for themselves no matter what they have you to believe. Which is typical of fast paced jobs such as target. Horrible management. Overall people are friendly. Just don't get personal.
bad,Working at Target at times was fun but also very frustrating. There was no real authority so reporting problems and complains was near impossible.
bad,A typical day at work.  Help customers find items.  Work with staff on projects.  Stock in caps.  Answer calls. and work cashiers.
bad,"Working at Target was Difficult. When we got our new Manager, he was a jerk and he didn't like the fact that I just finished high school and was promoted to a Electronics Team Leader. so he treated me very poorly. Liquidation then came and everything broke loose. everyone was upset and everyone was tired of getting yelled at by customers. honestly, we all wanted it to end at that point. be everything before that was fun to work at! enjoyed the team culture and meeting new people who made a big difference in my life! As much as I liked working there, i was quite happy to get my package and leave."
bad,The management did not care about the employees. They also do not give very many hours at all. Also they would not work around my school schedule like they said they would upon hiring me.
bad,management doesn't really listen to your problems and your schedual can get changed at a moments notice. co workers were always nice and always willing to help you with any problems.
bad,"Target is a great place to gain experience in a first job."
bad,"stocking and reset of plannograms busy challenging at times job, nothing consistant not even hours a lot of management changes which caused a lot of back n forth in what was gng on"
bad,"I was a store manager for rent a cent for about 3 years I was involved with hiring, terminating, promoting. Some of my responsibilities were receiving transferring product sales collections. When i took over the store I grew the store as in customer wise ,I profit the store achieved awards. I made sure it was important that the store was ran per company policy, training was done successfully, I created a happy healthy work environment to improve the quality of the store."
bad,I was a team member during Christmas season. It was always busy so I got to greet people all the time. I learned more team strategies and how to work in a very busy environment.
bad,"I do not believe this company does their part in advertising, which made it difficult to sell cell phones here. The work was enjoyable, but since it was difficult to sell cell phones in a place where no one knew they could buy them, the compensation was not so enjoyable."
bad,"You stock, zone, stock, zone, stock, zone for the majority of the day. In between all of that you have to help customers look for things that may or may not exist. And if you can't find it in the store, you have to climb mountains to find it for them online."
bad,"I enjoy meeting and talking with the many people that pass through, i have had many wonderful conversations and learned new things from many of the people. one guest in particular had asked for a toy we didn't currently have in and so asked if i could call him when it did come in. The morning it finally did come in I made the call he was so pleased he has written me a letter of recommendation. Many of my co-workers are just as wonderful as the guests friendly and always willing to help out when they can. However some of the management in there is questionable. I feel like they don't like to work with employees and make us as happy as the guests. I have asked for time off every now and then to spend with family because they have me working all weekend witch is the only time my family has off because they all work office jobs, target tells me that they cannot  because i must have open availability despite one of my co-workers having almost every Saturday off. But despite all that I learned that there are many people willing to led a hand and I love to see a child smile when they find the toy, game or movie they are looking for and I will go out of my way to try and make that happen."
bad,Dull work environment that was repetitive by nature. Very little advancement opportunity was found here. Over night was a burden to my daily schedule
bad,"When I first started working for Target, I really believed that it would be a job that I loved. While that was the case for a while, it sadly didn't end that way. Target in my opinion, is just a large cooperation that doesn't care enough about their employees."
bad,"•	Stocked shelves, maintained a clean work environment, assisted in sales, and performed cashier responsibilities."
bad,Pretty easy and laid back job. Really good if you are in college and need something flexible but management at times seem very disorganized and you are constantly being misdirected.
bad,Management only cared about the mistakes you made. You could be  giving good customer service all day and make one mistake and they would just point out that one negative.
bad,When I first started working there l really liked it but then things changed when I started over night my team treated I did not approve of and some management really didn't care about the team members
bad,"People are ok, dead lines are crazy and management expects to much from you, hours are all over the place and the pay for the work you do is insufficient"
bad,"A typical day at Target was basically a nightmare. Upon clocking in I was to find a PDA to use because my job requires one but majority of the time there was none to be found. Other employees would either hid them or not put them back where they where supposed to. The management is terrible to say the least. They basically had favorites and made sure said favorites where scheduled one there shifts so they could socialize. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom, could basically go anywhere and do what you wanted. Im saying this because one of the guys i was hired with took advantage of this freedom. He would take hour breaks instead of the standard half and would take 30 min paid breaks instead of the standard 15 min. I could go on and on about my experience working at Target but I'll end it here. I am not a fan of how they ran things at this particular Target."
bad,"Payroll was cut significantly and team members had to pick up the slack.  Not enough cashiers to meet demands of the guests so other work centers had to lend help at the front and were later reprimanded for poor guest survey scores as those associates could not help guests in their workcenters. Call buttons were a huge focus burt when everyone is on a register, nobody is available to help the guests on the floor at the call buttons. Response time would exceed standard of 60 seconds and guests would leave a poor survey."
bad,"the only thing I can say about this job is the compensation for selling phones is the greatest by far, but other then that the company itself is greedy and expect you to work like slaves."
bad,"A day at the distribution center I worked at for 4 years had its ""pros"" and ""cons"" as listed below but to be more specific on the summary id say It has its days. The work is generally easy and if you carry yourself well you should be okay BUT.... If your GL (group leader) in whatever department you wind up working for see's a report that your productivity is going down, now in some cases the work could be overwhelming (Peak Holiday) or just the general laziness some people carry but in the most case it comes down to the GL (also depending on how he or she sees it) most cases come down to a drop of volume which overall hurts every department in this way which brings me to it again.. Your GL knows the volume is down and just about everyone there is at the same rate you are or worse? But For some god knows reason hardly most GL's have a heart rate. I've myself have seen 5 Lead changes in 3 years. I don't blame most. Corporate rules with an iron fist and it can be scary at times."
bad,Tough environment to work in. Daily tasks and allotted time not enough to complete tasks. Co workers are great. A lot to do everyday with few to help complete.
bad,Target has to much management overhead. Most job positions have 2 or 3 individuals working at them when only one person is necessary.
bad,"A typical day at work would be great. I clock in, and prepare to unload a random piece truck. I've learn that in retail it can take a wall to move up the food chain as far as evolving in that company. Management for the most part is okay. My co-workers are fun to be around for the most part. In fact my co-worker make that much more enjoyable. The hardest part of my job is making up for lost time. Say for an example if someone calls out (me) Korey Andrews will have to pick up the slack. Since pretty much everyone counts on me when I am present. The most enjoyable part of my day is being there to help out with what needs to be done."
bad,"Always looked forward to going to work. My coworkers were fantastic and even though the constant lifting (for twelve hours) was difficult, the atmosphere and culture of the workplace made it worthwhile. Regrettably the management were never on top of things and many of the supervisors wouldn't take responsibility for their actions, pushing it down onto warehouse workers to take the blame instead."
bad,"The products sold were good.  The management left much to be desired.  They played favorites and deliberately ""got rid"" of employees who made more money than the newbies."
bad,"The management at Target is terrible, the business policies they use make no sense in the long run and a yearly pay raise is at most 25 cents. Hopefully you will have good co-workers to make each work shift bearable."
bad,"Stock shelves and make aisles look neat."
bad,"Some associates working there are VERY rude"
bad,"I am amazed at the amount of growth potential there is for this company. The opportunity to work for such a large retailer with so many programs in pace for growth was fantastic."
bad,"The company itself I like, however over my extended period of working there things changed dramatically. I used to come in and get my job done, without any issues or questions, management actually would help out if needed. But, over the past year, that changed significantly. "
bad,Stocked shelves. Nice people to work with. Hardly ever got off a shift on expected time.
bad,"I enjoyed my work that I performed in the Pricing Department.  Unfortunately you are working for a major retailer and the way they treat employees is sub-par.  The wages, hours and unrealistic expectations are the main reason the working environment is so bad."
bad,No support from store manager up through District level.  Hired brand new store managers from outside the company that had no retail experience or management experience.  Did not interview / promote from within.
bad,"Busy busy all day long. from the time you get to work to the time you get off your going be doing something,"
bad,"I work very early unloading trucks and stocking shelves. I enjoy meeting new people and learning new skills. There are no benefits and no days off are allowed, and the pay is only minimum wage. I am looking for something better."
bad,"I wake up 3am to get ready and be at work by 4am. Once at work I immediately want to leave. It is very easy work, very, very easy. However, there is no benefit of the job. The paychecks are very small and it feels like I am wasting my time there."
bad,Worked in customer service and as a cashier. Was a great environment to work in but no room to move up.
bad,"Pushing goods off from truck onto sales floor for customers to consumer purchases, maintaining a clean stock room for ease of replenishment."
bad,Stocking the floors with clothing and other merchandise.  Keeping shelves and floors neat.  Hardest part of the job is maintain the baskest were people did not want the merchandise.
bad,"•	Performing Great Customer Service "
bad,"Although working there wasn't the worst thing in the world, they didn't work with my clinical hours during school."
bad,"You will have to work many departments and cashier alot."
bad,Overnight stocking for a short period of time.  Seemed like a good company.
bad,"Target is not a fun, fast, or friendly place to work. The hours are long and the pay is low. And if you are not people oriented, then this is not the job for you. There are over one hundred employees at any given time so ""getting"" to know someone is almost impossible. And that's if a co-worker stays long enough for you to learn their name. Also, be prepared to come second to a Red Card because at the end of the day that's all management cares about, not you. If you make it past your ninety day probation be prepared for the disappointment of be evaluated as ""INCONSISTANTLY EFFECTIVE."""
bad,It a good place to work as far as dayside and the back room team. The flow/srocking team hour are low and its kind of hard to get more.
bad,The job was easy and they wanted people to strive for their best to move up.
bad,A typical day at Target starts at organizing the store and making sure everything looks nice and tidy. Pulling merchandise from the backroom to the floor is also included in one of our daily basis tasks.
bad,I enjoyed unloading the truck and stocking it taught me a lot.
bad,A typical day at work is collecting shopping carts and helping valuable customers to their vehicles with large purchases. The enjoyable part of the job was being able to be of assistance when customers needed more cashiers available.
bad,Too much to do in a work day with not enough pay. Not a job for someone wanting to support their family unless you are upper management.
bad,"Target itself was great to work at, as the employees had make a ""game"" out of who could get the most done that shift. The hardest part of that job was dealing with both the poor arrangements that Corporate had made for the employees, and the holiday rushes (Black Friday)."
bad,Work was challenge in getting the apt resume for the technology.
bad,"minor scope clinic, with schedules that varied often. Not able to utilize skills from college."
bad,It is decent. If you want to take on more hours you can. The management was ok.
bad,I would go into work and organise products on the shelf for 8 hours.
bad,Typical day at work: We always had to much to do and not enough time or team members.
bad,"I have given three years of my employment history to Target. I worked part time to finish college and obtain my degree. A typical day at target would be one were a worker gets unappreciated by Team leads, and never recognize by store managers. The co-workers are the best part, they literally make the job a connected community, or family. We come together as a team and we get the job done, by communicating pros and cons for the objective. We demonstrate team morale and lead by example I learned that this job has made my character very compromising and lenient. I will leave this job with the notion that i made a difference, whether or not i was recognize for it."
bad,Great company with excellent work life balance in the Distribution Centers.
bad,Target is very busy work that requires attention to detail.  Enjoyed my co-workers.  The most challenging part of the day was cleaning the floor in time for opening
bad,"service is no fun, this was my first job so in that sense it was ok, but I did not enjoy it."
bad,"Very demanding work environment with limited work/ life balance. Could have been a great experience under different circumstances, but personally I did not find it to be a fit with me. Far too many alterations being made to the team member structure, which is detracting from the enjoyable environment it was when I began working there."
bad,would open everyday and close always working and always would cover for the manager when she would call in but when i needed a favor or someone to cover for me i would get no help with that i always had find someone to take over my shift and just being taken advantage..
bad,The work place was great but the people weren't so great. Things never got done on time. Was just a bad place to work at
bad,Not a good pay scale for the work being done. The people on the job make the job alot better.
bad,"I work in the stock room of Target Canada, I started with helping set up the store before it opened. I receive inventory, sort inventory, stock shelves, attend to guests, run required equipment. The hardest part of my job is having a lack of leadership. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with some of the people i work with, and helping our guests out. I truly believe that to have success you must lead by example."
bad,There are these two blind women that comes into target all the time I always be the first to great them and assist them around the store. They really enjoy my help and I really enjoy helping them.
bad,Target only wants people who can keep the shelves stocked.  Being knowledgeable and making sales will not get you any recognition here.  I wouldn't work here again.
bad,"A typical day was managing 20-50 people. Lots of walking around the store and ensuring that all people were in the right place, and projects were getting done. The hardest part of the job was the coaching and feedback that I had to delver. The best part was learning so much about how the Target stores run and work on a daily basis!"
bad,good for students in high school and college looking for a temporary job
bad,"Pulled  inventory to go to sales floor, pushed to floor and backstock excess inventory in warehouse.checked accuracy of inventory,"
bad,Ensured that all shelves were fully stocked.  Trained new hires working within my department.
bad,This company is a forever growing and prosperous place to work.
bad,Target was my first job and it wasn't a great starting point. Initially I was excited to work at target. It seemed like a fun and professional work environment. It quite possibly could have been management that made it so hard to cope with this job. If you are a closer beware you will almost NEVER get to leave when you are scheduled to be off the clock. We went into compliance a lot because of the lack of time management.
bad,Target was fun to work for the managers are very helpful but the pay stinks they expect too much and with the pay it does not balance at all
bad,"Target was a very great place to work. I learned a lot of new things. Target is well organized and very team supporting. Though they could use a little help in the managing area. Businesses have to be very careful about whom they hire to run different areas of the store. Managers are meant to work also, not just give orders. They are there to show the other team members exactly how the job should be done. Target taught me to set high goals for myself, and not just at home or school but at work too. Without high, nearly impossible goals a person will always settle for the median requirement."
bad,"the pay is good, but good luck being one of the new team members to join target. they will fire you for no reason way before you hit your 90-day."
bad,"My work experience in Target was good we had good leaders who pays much attention to the employees ,give them good salary and also they are more concerned with the security of their workers where by they need every employee to be safe,secure and comfortable with the work he or she is doing.The leaders are very organized ,social and friendly to everyone and their management seems to be good. but I never saw any  cultural activities at Target.In general i can say it is a good company ever.The hardest part was zoning because you can zone right now but after five minutes the place looks maze again and the most enjoyable part was cashier is just meeting with different smiling faces attending to them and that is it.for my job at Target I was payed $10.75 . I have worked with this company for several months but they refused to schedule me as other students because of my age."
bad,"Helping Customers "
bad,"Hated it!"
bad,I worked here while in high school and they were great with working with my school schedule. They always made sure to put my education first.
bad,expect looooong hours and give no respect to their management staff.
bad,"Face paced with little room for growth, enjoyed the customers,"
bad,"Over all it's a good company to work for, but only if you are looking for a part time job. I would not recommend this job as a career."
bad,"Inbound Calls regarding credit cards. "
bad,To busy and unorganized. the turn over rate was unbelievable.
bad,I enjoyed meeting different people and customers. I also enjoy working with my co workers and meeting new people
bad,"The hardest part of the job is having people consistently get smart and have attitude with you but you can not do or say anyhing back to them,"
bad,A day a work is waking up in the morning to be at work at 4am when I get there I grab everything I need to help me threw my shift all my back stock carts my flat beds bags for trash and cage to put all boxes in. I learn something everyday weather its meeting new team members or something being reset over in my department. I love my co-workers like having another family everyone helps one another. Management is OK I just wish they new how to respond to the request we ask from them. The hardest part of the job is feeling like we do so much work with so little pay I go to work and give it 110% and don't get a thank you. What I love about the job is working with hard team players who understand what everyone is going threw but yet in all we all come together and get the job done.
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place to work. It literally drains you mentally and physically.
bad,I enjoyed all the friends i made at Target..the work area was hot with little air fans but i felt good when i completed my job on time .I learned a lot about receiving and shipping
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of starting out the day with no direction from the team lead, followed by a team meeting where the team lead would ""fuss and yell"" about how we were not doing what we were supposed to be doing. The co-workers in my section were great, we would all get together and make a plan and work towards a certain goal and make sure that we met it as quickly and accurately as possible. The hardest and least enjoyable part of the job would have to be that once my section was done with our part we would have to go and help the other sections in the store because they did not work as a team."
bad,"This is not the best job to work for. unprofessional and not the best environment, rude workers."
bad,My time at Star Tek was spent learning the ins and outs of Verizon Co.
bad,"I had the best schedule known to man and was making fabulous money - and yet I developed health issues and left work a wreck each day I was there.  The culture is designed to be cut throat and you are expected to rise above by standing on the heads of your peers.  Some people may thrive in that environment, but at a turnover rate of 78 percent amongst supervisors in the building - a restructuring of that thought process might be in order.  Of course, I would be surprised if anyone I worked with was still there."
bad,"I do not have any complains as far as my coworkers are concerned during my time here, but management team was always changing. Things were always changing because of this, hours were being cut, and people with seniority were never considered. "
bad,"A very physical and fast paced environment. One task to the next with a minimal break time can be considered over-working. "
bad,"enjoyed very much working at target have for9 years. the last couple of month it has become very hard and stressful because of ther red cards . they want you to ask people if they want a red card and if they say no , they want you to keep telling the person about the card and i am having a hard time harrasing people no means no. they are really pushing us and i am not comfortable doing that . they have started taking people in the office and bulling teammembers, which is a shame because i did like my job, some of the younger teammembers are telling how scared and stressed they are . a job should not be like that and i feel like i need to move on .   "
bad,Typical day at work is work your butt off and get little in return. I learned a lot about logistics and rules and regulations with the health department. Management had good days and bad. Good days they would say nice things about your work and encourage you to move up in the company. Most bad days were caused by you making a mistake or having to call out (which I VERY rarely did). Hardest part was working your butt off thinking you were going to move up in the company and you never do. The most enjoyable part was the people.
bad,I currently still work with Target. Within the five years working there the best part of my job is being able to move in different areas within the store and learning to do new things. I believe the more challenging thing about working with Target is knowing that I have been working in four different positions in within Target and do not get paid the regular wage for those positions. The management is often out of office and hard to get in contact with at time and often forgetful. 
bad,"I was only there when I was on summer and winter breaks from school, so I wasn't there very often."
bad,"Working at target is like having your mother watch over your back every day. Managers don't trust their team members or team leaders to do there jobs and micromanage everything. Your team leaders who know what their doing make the job great, but the ones who are slaves to the managers make the job awful. Bad pay for the amount of work you do."
bad,"Day consisted of the supervison of 55 employees, monitoring inventory, and salesfloor replenishment."
bad,It was a fun job and one that was there when i needed it. It was a seasonal postion
bad,I started off liking the job...But then management changed and so did the good vibe of the job.
bad,"It's good pay and you never have to work overtime or stay late. The job seems to be getting worse. The managements only concern lately is numbers, numbers, numbers. You could be an all around great employee but if you're at 99% and not 100% or over you will be getting talked to and eventually written up. Another thing that is bothersome is managements style to treat people like they are 5 yrs old and the feeling they give off as its never enough. It takes awhile to get any training so new employees are always stuck doing the non desirable very physical work every day.This job will knock 20 years off your life."
bad,Working with people on the sales floor and helping customers find what they are looking for. 
bad,"Target's ""fast, fun and friendly idea"" is not as true to heart as it was meant to be. There is no worklife balance and the expectations are unrealistic."
bad,"Terrible company to work for, no growth, not enough hours and not enough pay."
bad,"I could work several areas of the store. Frequently I would come to work scheduled to work in one area, the L.O.D (Leader On Duty) would ask if I would work in an area that someone else had not shown up for work. This way I was assisting the team to function better to aid the Guests."
bad,"Oversee team under me. Make schedule, and give annual reviews."
bad,"If you end up working for Target be prepared to work all weekends, nights, and holidays. Management is out for themselves so if there is a way they can get out of trouble and blame it on you they will do it and write you up for it no matter how unfair it may be. I can say that during my time there I was able to learn many valuable management skills and time management techniques. Promoting from within doesn't happen very often so be prepared to stay in the position you are in for the long haul and train people that make more money then you do. If you are lucky enough to have a store that has a great h.r. they will do their best to make you feel valued"
bad,I was a very hard worker and loved the job. I liked the customers they were very friendly. My supervisor was understanding and the employees taught me a lot.
bad,This place was a great place to gain experience in the working world
bad,Work was very repetitive with no sense of advancement. Most employees didn't care about the job. Managers showed little interest in the concern of employees. Not a very enjoyable workplace.
bad,"Great learning experience in a new field, loved working with so many different people."
bad,Awful company to work for.
bad,Work well with an unopen work schedule
bad,not to much to say didnt work there very long but it was and ok job
bad,"target cater to college students, chance for promotions was based on education. management was strick, has fast as you put stock up you had to turn around and pull it back out for team leaders to merchandise. not having enough tubs to put merchandise in was a pain. it was indeed a different type of work place."
bad,"-A typical day at work consisted of conducting morning meetings with employees to discuss any new or revised changes within the company and to mention opportunities noticed after walking the entire store to observe the presentation of it. In addition, my day also entailed constant walking around the store, continuously reading emails to stay current on essential information, delegating and following up with my team leaders to ensure employees were executing assignments to achieve company goals."
bad,"Check in, inmediately after that I used to have two to three minutes to get to work. I learned something different from my others jobs. My co-workers were too cold, it was to hard to work there b ecause to much discrimination against hispanic people."
bad,liked the job but it was only 20-32 hrs a week they called it DX'S or daily extras so we had no insurance or any benefits at all.
bad,Very unorganized corporation. Bad pay. Lack of good training.
bad,Working was alrightbut it was too strung out as well as the fact that during a school day being called in to work too much
bad,target is ok. they kinda suck with hours also. i mean its a job but i wouldnt try to make a career out of it
bad,When I got hired at Target I was happy because I have to not only pay student loans but also where I live jobs are hard to get. I worked at Target for a little over a year. My schedule was Monday through Friday on the Presentation team with good hours. Plano is a tedious job but could be fun when not rushed. Working at Target the first half of the year was great until a new supervisor took over.
bad,"First off, I would like to mention that I moved from New York to Florida. I went to my HR in New York to help me transfer. She said that she would but ultimately never did anything. I gave her 3 months notice and she did not attempt to help me until a week before I was set to move out of state. I was told that I would be fine and not to worry. My last day at that store she told me that she never had a chance to help me transfer because she was too busy. This was frustrating to me because my room mate at the time also worked at this same store and was transferred with no problem. I honestly think that she could have had more training. Not sure if she was just a bad HR or did not receive the training she needed."
bad,over time in the company employees loss the ability to move up.
bad,Had a lot issues with higher up and favoritism. No room to move up. Co workers were great
bad,deserved a promotion ....didnt get one...i was becoming over qualified for my position.
bad,This would be a good place for students but I would not recommend it if you are looking for a career.
bad,"Hard work, a lot of standing, also a lot of drama between fellow team members. Strict work schedule"
bad,"Target is a good company to work for, the people are fun and friendly. It would be better if they didn't cut hours so much."
bad,"There was always task to be done. But there were a lot of people that just slacked, leaving the ones doing there job to pick up the slack. The slack pick up wasn't always noticed my management."
bad,the target on haldeman has the worst shift runners and its very unorginized .the shift runners just sit in the break room and read magazines all night .
bad,very nice people i was able to get much exp.in diffrent areas of the company.
bad,"Not a great pkace to work. They expect and demand so much, it is unreasonable and once your on a salary kiss your work life balance good bye. It can be good but your store location is a key factor."
bad,The hardest part of working at Target is having a manager who does not see the hard work you put in daily to meet their needs. I say their needs because it is never what the customers as for it is mainly what the manager what and need to help them in the long run with corporate.
bad,Target still does the rotating management style that completely undermines the team members ability to build up a rapport with their manager. They also hire kids straight out of college to run their stores.
bad,"The job is easy, you’ll be trained for your area. Really great atmosphere but the management/HR REALLY needs some improvement. It makes it harder to come to work"
bad,They will lie to you during the interview and promise benefits and full time hours. That’s what happened to me and then I was robbed of hrs! Started off working 40hrs a week then chopped down to 17 or 18hrs a week! When I spoke to HR about it they said there was nothing that could be done and to deal with it.
bad,Company is changing direction. No longer a happy place to work at. Workplace culture has gone down. Customers come first. Always. Learned how to work in a fast-paced environment.
bad,Target is a good company but there wasn’t much opportunity at my location for advancement. There may be at other locations. The pay was very low and the hours were always cut which is upsetting when you have bills
bad,"in a year a lot has changed, the new monderzation is not working. When I first started I was getting 37 hours a week, then when we rolled out the new processes I got cut back to 20. No one can live off of 20 hours a week. A lot of turnover, always getting a new team lead because target over works you and underpays you. Excepts you to get the job done of 4 people, make sure you push the truck, backstock and don’t forgot to zone and reshop all in a 4 hour shift!"
bad,I worked in loss prevention. It was a fun time. I liked to catch the bad guys and put them in jail. I was the top performer in the store out of 4 other loss prevention individuals. But they have quotas on how many your supposed to get and the price point you can go after if they conceal and all other types of things. To where corporate is always making you feel like you are at risk for your job. Because target loves to cut out positions they feel as if they are not needed. Other then the constant threat of losing your job fun times though.
bad,overall i enjoyed the people that i worked with i just didn't make enough to stay with the company would go back though if they would take me. management wasn't to bad i just didn't get enough hours
bad,"This isn’t a terrible place to work if you’re a kid going to school or as a second job. Their starting rates are generous but there’s not really opportunity for advancement or raises. The management is awesome and nice, very accommodating. The discounts are nice. Other than that though, there are no other upsides. The hours are always being cut and you’re never garaunteed more than 20 hours a week, if that. The schedule changes randomly. People aren’t expected to follow through with their job- someone else will always get to it seems to be the case. There isn’t enough walkies or devices for everyone on the morning and day shifts therefore getting your work done efficiently is compromised. There’s no set plan for training, you’re kind of just tossed in. And what position you work completely depends on the day after you’ve already showed up for your shift- regardless of where you’re scheduled to be. Although everyone is very nice and there’s usually even free food in the break room, the hours are horribly hard to come by and they never seem to promote within. Even as a seasonal job, this just did not cut it. Won’t recomment anyone work here unless they can live on under $200 a check..."
bad,"Working for Target can be stressed full at times. I love my coworkers and managers but the HR at my target isn't helpful, and friendly. I don't think I can go to my HR there. I tried changing my availability  times and they won't approve it and it was for my school, unfortunately they said that my avability doesn't meet their hours but I thought they would be more understanding because it was school but they were not. Coworkers have left in the past because they would be scheduled while in class."
bad,I loved the place when I was just a team member. You pretty much just show up and do work that any person can do. Easy easy work but can be boring and tedious. As a manager it really sucked. Upper management was super cliquey and I didn’t trust them the slightest. Talking bad about the employees and other managers. It was toxic and sickening working with those disgusting people.
bad,a typical work day is hectic. I learned that being a multitasker is a good trait to have working here. Management is strict. Workplace culture is good when your fellow employees can help. The hardest part is the job is being given 3 or 4 things to do at once and it’s mandatory to get it done before your shift is over. The most enjoyable part about the job is your fellow employees being so kind and helpful.
bad,"My hours varied, so most of the time was good hard work.  I liked working with my co-workers and customers.  The customers and team members in other departments are all great to work around, and the work was most enjoyable.  The company, however, went from a great place to work to a place that was barely tolerable.  I miss most of the people, but the company is in dis-array, and I do not miss that one bit."
bad,The job is great if you like doing one task at a time like stocking or organizing items during holidays it gets hectic but that's expected its a job for more people who do not like many human interactions and like to keep to them selves.
bad,Working here was not too bad other than the fact that there were little to no hours after the holidays. Management picked favorites and gave them what they wanted but did not do the same for others
bad,Intense but educational environment. If you are entry level expect to work more than 40 hours a week. It is important to remember at a big company that you are just a number
bad,No fixed schedule or guaranteed hours per week. May or may not be provided health insurance depending on your average hours. Stressful to do job duties with the hours scheduled.  There  is diversity. Job is more like high school students or first time workers.
bad,It was a good fun experience for me I like working there the workers showed me how to work at a slow paste an fast paste working there in the morning was the best time for me.
bad,"worked the registers"
bad,"stressful "
bad,"Target has a very strong corporate culture.  If you're in then you're in but if you are not a model of their fast, fun, and friendly culture than you're out."
bad,I didn't feel alone when the guy's and I would work on the production line and out front sweating and out of breath. I wished I would of switched to soft lines instead of hard lines.
bad,If your're not willing to work majority closing shifts then this job isn't for you. I had a daytime shift maybe once a week but I closed for the most part. The team overall is cool but the leads definitely show favoritism toward those who have worked there longer. Those are the ones they keep on the daytime shifts until the weekend. Those people never close! I opened most saturdays and maybe a monday here and there but for the most part I closed the store which means getting off at 11:30. I got the job at the beginning of the Summer but when school started I requested a schedule change due to me not being able to close anymore. It got rejected so I had to quit so I could avoid getting fired for calling out on the days I had to work til close. I wish I could've stayed but I just could not work those late hours.
bad,"Co worker are easy to get along with, guest are sometimes rude, management is very supportive when needed for guest service, fast pace work and you learn alot."
bad,It was a great place to work and loved the discount and the hours were nice also you could have a nice clean area to work and not a ton of drama or rudeness
bad,"The management were great and I really did enjoy the leaders I worked under, however the culture of the company was sloppy and lacking. A number of co-workers would not show up to work and we were understaffed for a number of days. The pay was very minuscule and there really isn't many options for higher opportunities other than management."
bad,The pay is pretty good so thats one plus. On the other hand in return your expected to live in the store. The only holiday your really going to ever get off is easter. It's retail so expected a good portion of your day/life spent in the store.
bad,"I was a cashier with guest services experience. I felt unappreciated. I felt scheduling should have been better organized. The team leads would put first people in at Guest Services whether they knew Guest Services or not. You would think the schedule could have been coded to have Guest Services Members scheduled from open to close, but that was not the case. So the Team Members who knew Guest Services were put on a check lane on a busy Saturday, and new Team Members who hadn't learned to operate the registers were put at Guest Services. This created a lot of stress for Team Members, and for guests. Target has lost many valuable Team Members because of this. Also, it's very humiliating to be trained for Guest Services, and report to work to be on a check lane for your full shift. Cashiers pride themselves on that advancement to Guest Services. It's a slap in the face!! I did my job, and I did it well. I always worked hard to complete all of my tasks, and assist with helping things to run smoothly."
bad,"At first this job was great, friendly coworkers and mostly nice customers. After being there for a couple months things started changing for the worse. Management started becoming rude and piling more work on us than normal. I felt as though we weren't working as a team anymore."
bad,"Good environment, good quality of merchandise, the team leaders are really support for the regulars employees.Clean stores.The team members help each other and excellent customer services."
bad,Target is an OK job. But they are always all over the place and Managers and team leads can have an amazing attitude always get recognized for doing your job. Co workers are amazing especially flow team. Worst thing would be you never leave at the right time they never get to finis truck because everyone leaves and sometimes a couple people have to stay for a long time.
bad,its nice working at a clothing store. usually you spend money where are working if you are constantly working with the clothes where you can stay ahead of all of the latest trends and fashions.
bad,Target was a good place to work.. it paid well and had a good benefit package.. Management never bothered you as long as you were getting your numbers
bad,Its a fast fun and friendly company but there is too much turn over and most of the time the higher managers are not trained enough to know how to do their job
bad,"I just really didn't care working with food,plus i was getting sick a lot ended up i had cancer. it was hard to get help. no one stay long the turn over rate was bad."
bad,"Working at target was defiantly an experience that I will never forget. I learned how to deal with people from all different backgrounds. My Co-workers defiantly made the job interesting, and enjoyable at times. The management was by far the worst I have ever had to deal with."
bad,"I had a good supervisor. The compensation and benefits were very good.  But the work enviroment was hostile and extremely stressful. "
bad,"A typical day at work is faced paced. I leaned to be very flexible to where I was needed on any given day, and many different areas of the store. I found being flexible reduced the chances of boredom setting in because you are in different areas every day."
bad,"Hourly team members were great to work with."
bad,"Granted I was placed in a struggling store, but the value of work life balance is not in place. I know retail is a struggle, but this was beyond a struggle."
bad,a typical day would be rushed and stressful .i learned how to handle situations and do the job safely. co-workers could have been more officiant.getting wagons loaded was hard and the enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
bad,"As a cashier I learned to deal with customers in a calm and respect full manner. I learned to advertise the target red car while getting done with customers quick as to not hold up line. I learned, checking, wic checking and credit/debit transaction."
bad,"In my experience working here I learned a lot about retail and made some long time friends.  The atmosphere was friendly and co-workers were willing to help each other and were eager about their jobs. Management was good too.  Though they did offer benefits, at $8.00/hr you might end up spending your paycheck paying for them...  Also, holidays were the busiest so no time off.  But that's retail, right?"
bad,"I enjoyed working at Target because my co workers were very respectful, management was timely and on top of all things brought to them. Customer service was very well."
bad,"Work in food service "
bad,"Working for Target for 17 years, I learned a lot about the retail business. From the back of the house to front. I enjoyed pretty much of my different roles as a leader. "
bad,a lot of workers just stood around chit chatting and not doing their jobs. it was hard for me to work there
bad,target is cool if your in high school or retired. The compensation was extremely poor.
bad,I developed a lot of photos which was fun to see peoples funny photos or baby pictures. Management was ok. It was a lot of managers but sometimes it felt like you were being watched at all times. The co workers were A LOT of drama. The hardest part was the drama I encountered which ultimately led to me resigning. The most enjoyable part was developing the photos.
bad,"When working at Target, I enjoyed the first 2 weeks. Then some of the management team started to become impatient, with those who just started because they had trouble keeping up with all the customers that need to be checked out.  Some customers would try to rush the cashiers including me because the customer had to get somewhere but did not leave enough time to get what they need from store. So, they became very impatient."
bad,great environment to work in. I've learned leadership skills and productivity. Management was also great. There was no hard part of the job.
bad,"Typical day was basically trying to deter theft."
bad,A typical work day was slow not many people. I learned about different types of phones and how to activate them.
bad,a typical day at work is its usually slow in the evenings and usually busy on the weekends.
bad,"Operated all aspects of the Kodak photo lab, assisted customers with photo orders, developed 35 mm film, and covered lunch breaks for the employees of the guest services counter/check-outs when needed. I learned about photo development, color, paper types, and the Kodak kiosk and software. Worked with very little to no supervision. Worked independently at the photo lab, worked with various others at guest services and check-outs. The most difficult part of the job was the malfunctioning of the photo developing machinery. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was the customers."
bad,"This company does a very good job relating their company culture through videos, pamphlets and training. The compensation and benefits are very competitive and keep up with increasing cost of living expenses."
bad,Your Benefits are good with this company but gives no real support either in help nor invectives to the Regular workers.
bad,I think they where very unfair to people who where very good workers
bad,They seem like they are all over the place. Most employees are pretty rude. I think they could use a day where they close the store and have a meeting.
bad,"The overall environment at target, is amazing. Fast pace, friendly and professional environment were some of the things that made this one of the best jobs out there. Although, after the holidays your hours will be cut more than 96%"
bad,"The store leaders do not communicate well with the team members, because what they need to communicate is not clear through district and corporate leaders throughout the country. Stores all around the United States have come out with statements saying that the new ""modernization"" plan that kicked in this fiscal year has backfired on the company big time, losing the most valuable team members at stores nationally. My first year and a half at target was great, and the job was fun. I loved going to work and seeing all of the people I worked with, and loved what I did daily, but as soon as this ""modernization"" plan kicked in my store, along with a bunch of others apparently, came crashing down, and the number of team members at my store has dropped significantly because of this unnecessary and extreme change. Target has dropped the amount of hours and payroll, and positions per store, but has increased the pay (which is the same for everyone, despite experience or talent; absolutely ridiculous because not everyone deserves the same pay.) and workload for the fewer team members at stores. This has caused major stress and chaos among team leaders and members throughout stores nationally, and it is just not a good place to work, mentally."
bad,Working at target was a very pleasurable experience for most of the time that I have been there. There are many ups and downs. This job has helped me mature in many ways.
bad,"TARGET store in Rhode Island "
bad,"I had a great time working with my co workers, they were all cheery and nice to everyone. But all the managers had favorite employees and then get away with things, and then blamed others for it. The different managers seemed like they didn’t talk to each other at all. They all had seperate views of how’s thinga should be done, so one day you’re doing it right and the next you’re not."
bad,"I use to love target until I joined the team and was fired for a broken ankle I received while in a car wreck. Target has good benefits with the company, but the management I was under was completely wrong for firing me for my circumstance."
bad,"We would start off in a employee meeting, breaking down what needs to be done for today. which helped make things easier on all floor leaders. I learned multiple ways to work with employees, and decide who was capable of what jobs. The management was very informative, and willing to help at any time. The hardest part of the job i would have to say was bringing a new worker into the swing of things. You could usually tell after a days work who would be able to handle the pressure of the job. The most enjoyable parts of working at target would have to be the people/employees,."
bad,"I enjoyed all the physical and organizational aspects of the job, but being able to tell customers where everything was wigged me out too much. The MyDevice was confusing to search for items. Management was friendly and fair for the most part, and attempted to help me with my problems, but it was the height of the holidays and I was a liability. I was seasonal, and I was expected to get a hang of the ropes in 2 weeks versus the normal 90-day learning curve. I told them ahead that I was on the autism spectrum, and they didn't seem to really take that into account when handling my emotional problems, but I have the ability to manage my symptoms so I'm not holding that over them too much."
bad,"Generally this should be a decent place to work. However, I had one manager (who eventually was fired) that threatened to fire us over not getting people to sign of for Red Cards."
bad,A good place to work except for the fact that they're always hiring but at the same time they don't value employees that work hard and want more work hours.They are confused when it comes to your job duties.For instance if you are working as stocking on the salesfloor they sometimes would schedule you as a cashier.The benefits is great but not worth it if you're not scheduled enough hours.
bad,Working at target was just something that I could do for a quick buck but it wasn't anything super enjoyable. The hours were very long and the only enjoyable thing about working there was the people. I don't recommend this to someone looking for a career but if you want to make some money it's a decent part time gig.
bad,i have equipment operator order puller slotting and i  am so excited to apply at the company .i have been a fan to the company for along time and would love to be a part of the team a again.
bad,"The people I worked with were fantastic, but target needs to work on helping every day team members not just the management, but a over all it was a job until I found a job in my career field."
bad,It was fun working at target but I did not like the managers. store manager was not a person. she was mean to the team leader. I also learn a lot working in large.
bad,"I learned a variety of different things at Target. From unloading, to driving the forklift. It was an amazing first time experience working there. I gained a lot of things that I still use today."
bad,"After 20 years of services my target (southport park) is closing with little over 3 months notice, with such short notice our full time and part timers have had little to no success in locating jobs. All other target in my area are looking exclusively for casuals to save money."
bad,"Worked loading trucks very hard type job, Worked hard but did it. Loaded up 7 trucks at atime 10 hours a day. Very demanding of a job  pay was good had weekends off."
bad,"A typical day for me was interacting with the customers and cleaning and stocking. I learned a lot about Target. I learned about their red cards and rewards, how to better assist customers, and learned about their benefits programs. But the management sucks. They were very unprofessional towards their employees, disorganized, and very unfriendly. The hardest part about this job is dealing with the management. But the most enjoyable part is helping and meeting new people everyday."
bad,"Working at Target has been a very eye opening experience, in teaching me more about myself and where I really want to be going forward with my career. Target is a generally nice place to work but with any job you have your ups and downs."
bad,Target is not a very laid- back environment. I was not very fond of all of my co- workers. Target was where I first experienced working as a cashier. I learned A lot about being a cashier while I was at Target.
bad,I hated the Target in Greensburg because it was all drama. The management did things to see how far the could push you. They lied to you and made you feel like a slave.
bad,"•	Loaded trucks and routed package through facility"
bad,"I love the company Target. However the hours are inconsistent, which makes living off of the pay difficult. Love wont pay the bills!"
bad,"I worked in the Outbound Dept. as a seasonal. I find the job is NOT for everyone. Your typical day consists of hand loading(stacking) anywhere from 4-8 truck trailers for 12 hours ( For 3 days). They also expect you to also jump on a lift to drop off varies products to other trailers in order for you to reach a 100% or better score each day to insure your employment and in order for you, if you choose, to transfer out of that Dept. in to another Dept. I personally believe that out in Outbound they push the workers too far than they need to to achieve their goals. I would have 4-7 trucks at a time and they rush the product so fast down the lines that you struggle to keep up and so fast that you are unable to get on the lifts to help you achieve your daily goal. Not only do stack the products in the trailers by hand you are required to push varies number of pallets in with the aid of a pallet jack. I kid you not their were times I would get 6 pallets or more dropped off into each line and I had to push them into the trailers. Some of these pallets would be water pallets and they would be very difficult to move due to their weight. During that type of issue you would have to leave your trucks in order to find someone who is trained to operate a forklift to help assist you and by doing so you run the risk of falling behind on your trucks. I feel that they need to go back and look on how to assist workers in achieve the goals that they have set forth. When I worked there there was next to nothing in the terms of training. They would throw you into trucks without any tips, suggestions,"
bad,I learned that no matter how hard you work or dedicate yourself to your job money or cutting costs will always win over dedication
bad,"A typical working day at Target wasn't for the ordinary person. If you were more of a night time person, then this job was for you. Usually started work at 11 and finished at about 7 or later. It all depended on how much there was to do and how big the load was. Working over time was always happening. Wouldn't get out until sometimes 12 in the afternoon. Always worked with partners or a group. Just working there was a good environment. It was always a welcoming environment. Management was dispersed between a few Team leads who rotated days when they would come in. They all communicated well with all the employees. Never found a hard part in this job. It was always fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was, being around a great group of people. Everyone was nice and very controversial."
bad,"The management here walk around like they are super superior. There is a lot of talk and gossip in the workplace going on behind closed doors. I wouldn't say that it is a long-term profession and no one can be trusted. I appreciate the opportunity to be a supervisor's assistant, but they were judgmental and I felt I wasn't liked by most management, possibly because I am a strong and confident black women that is fun and outgoing. Lots of people take this as competition or intimidation. I would say the hardest part of my job was being lying on by co-workers and dealing with the carelessness and harshness of the management team. The most enjoyable was making a living and a somewhat better atmosphere than some other work places I have worked in."
bad,"This is a great opportunity for anyone who needs a part-time job, however, if you are not hired into the ETL internship or STL training program, advancement and promotional opportunities are very hard to come by."
bad,workers and management need help. when a employee with learning disabilities is bullying from them. they didn't do anything not even corporate.  they let it happen.
bad,"Very VERY fast paced and labor intensive. The general manager  is good, but some of the leads for different departments are horrible with their attitudes. They pay 13/hr which is nice,yes, but you're lucky to even get 2p hours. They make you do so much in your shift because of the pay raise and pressure you to finish on time because theres no overtime. The leads are horrible trainers so the regular coworkers end up training you. Domt work here."
bad,I want to go back but I didn’t have a great manager at the experience that I was there. It’s good environment over there. Friendly customer but the manager is
bad,I arrive at 6 am and grab my my device and walkie. I head to the back and get ready to start pushing truck. Once truck is done I prepare the merchandise to be pushed to the front of the store and stocked.
bad,"I was hired on as a full time associates and I was being given the worst hours i could have possibly imagined, some weeks i would have 6 hours and other weeks it would be 40.  There was NO financial stability unless you've ben working there for years and took a spot that someone else had. the manual labor you put in has no positive outcome at the end of the day. a dollar over minimum wage and a sore body is all you ever got."
bad,Titus was a great experience I really don't have much to say about their job it was very many years ago I would like not to talk about that thank you.
bad,"As a flow team member you would go in before target opened, and unload the trucks in the back of the store. You then take the pallets to the front of the store, and stock shelves. The management never did any work, and they constantly yelled at everyone. Everyone else was great and very helpful."
bad,"Get started working as soon as I clock in. I've learned to do some inventory, unload truck and restock and replenish the store shelves. Also have knowledge in using store equipment. Manager is hands-on and always helpful. Target is an equal opportunity employment. Handling the manual jack and moving heavy vehicles throughout the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is working and getting along with my co-workers."
bad,"I was an intern, it was a great way to build on my management and other professional skills. Retail at a management level can be cutthroat because you have to meet quotas."
bad,"Target is a great company but it doesn't have work/life balance. You will work 55 hours a week. Target isnt for everyone, overall there some good and bad things about the job"
bad,Also the temperature in the store is set by people in Minnesota so if you live in the south it will be hot in your local target. Good pay but you have to deal with people who have enough money to enjoy life so they are petty and hostile.
bad,"I was lucky to get the chance to work at Target, but I was only offered a seasonal position, due to the full crew they had hired beforehand. I had gotten a lot of hours starting out at the store and was often called in for some extra hours if I had wanted them. As time grew on, I wasn’t getting the hours I needed such as 5 hours per week- which meant one day per week I was working. They weren’t very flexible with time off for family events or personal situations, when I brought them up for consideration. Even then, the staff has been nothing but helpful and friendly when I was learning how to work my position as a hardline worker."
bad,"alot of movements, i learn that the product comes in various shapes and sizes. Management is excellent, there's a hugh cultural diversity i worked along with. The hardest part of the job was learning how to use the RF scanner."
bad,"The thing about doing sales at Target is that the store forces you to push Unnecessary things on customers, most notably Target cards. Weekly quotas were annoying to deal with, and the rewards were really not worth it. If you didn't ask literally everyone who came through if they wanted to sign up for a card, a manager would overhear and reprimand you. Of course, they were just doing their jobs too. Overall 2/10 would not recommend"
bad,Target has good benefits and good security.When it comes to fulfilling guest complaints quick they not on it hard enough.
bad,Target didn't pay well and you worked very hard.And management was a hit or miss because they always had new managers coming in.
bad,"Typical day at work Handle store merchandise Assist customers at the cash register  Set and maintain the shelves "
bad,"It was a nice, calm, and relaxing place to work at. You would show up and everyone working there greets you, and is happy to have you on their team."
bad,"Target is the best job I have had, so to give it such a low rating was difficult, but there are some important issues that prevent the Morgantown Target from becoming the great store it could be. With that being said, I have been working at this Target during a massive transition period where we have gone through 3 STL's during a few months and have lost almost ALL of our store's leadership. Our retention rate is terrible, so it is a difficult store to keep organized and staffed."
bad,"A typical day at work would be coming in around 2:30 and heading straight to the back room of target and starting on the 2:00 pulls, stocking the shelves, & placing any backstock on to the tub and putting it back in the right stock room. While being at Target i've learned what it means to be fast, fun, & friendly when it comes to givhelping a guest out with any of their requests. It's important that you don't let the guest go without feeling that they've got the help they needed when entering the store & left feeling with the impression that they don't have to wait for a long period of time while shopping there. Management overall made sure that they kept their workers on the right track & focused on the task at hand. The hardest part of the was making sure that all tasks were completed before the deadline that had to be met & being able to do it without leaving any room for error. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to work hard but still have fun with co-workers that did things as a family, whether it was on the outside or Target or on the inside of it."
bad,"12 hour shifts saturday through monday, work was not hard. i felt like i wasn't trained properly and they left you out there alone without knowledge of what you are doing."
bad,"When I first started working in this position, I was excited because this is my local Target, the one I always go to, so I thought ""Hey! Awesome that I get to work at my favorite local store!"" It was fun during the Halloween season, obviously. However, once the ACTUAL Thanksgiving/Black Friday/Christmas season came around, it got VERY STRESSFUL and difficult to keep up with everything. Guests would be snappy and rude to me, and then management EXPECTED me to just stand there and take the attitude. Every time I stood up for myself and the store, suddenly it was ME getting trouble with management, apparently. The day I was told I was no longer going to be kept for the regular season, I thought it was a breath of relief. NEVER will I work for Target again."
bad,"I really enjoyed my time at Target but team members are rarely getting more that 15 hours a week. They start at $13, but my schedule next week is only for 10 hours. This week I’m scheduled for 15 hours. I’m moving on. "
bad,Money hungry managers will force your push Red Cards in order to boost sales on a psychological gimic. Managers didn't like when you didnt sell cards.
bad,I loved working with the people that I got to work with and know. I met a lot of people who are my friends. The job was tough because you were on a time schedule and if you didn't get it done it time you were in trouble. I left because I felt that my time at my work place was up and that I needed to move on and do better things.
bad,"Working for target in Lawton, OK  is fun the pay is nice however they don't provide the hours to match the pay. It's an easy job the work atmosphere is relaxed but management is poor."
bad,I go to backroom to get shipped boxes to put on the carts ... then I go do my stock on HBA health beauty area .. I learned how use zebra to check price
bad,People especially management was just extremely rude and one sided. If your looking for a job where everyone is treated equally this is not the place for you !!!!
bad,Worked at Target Card Services for many years spending most on the edge of corrective action.  The work enviroment is petty and high school like and the management allows it.  Lots of work to do and busy most of the time.
bad,I enjoy  the night shift also like the fast pace environment. Cross training is a plus. Hardest part of the job is reset of items being moved
bad,"Throughout my time of employment with this company I was provided the opportunity for much advancement; beginning as a kart attendant at the front end of the store, to a back room team member and other position in between."
bad,"Great work environment, learned a great deal about the retail workplace."
bad,I wasnt comfortable at Target corporation. I felt like they werent understandable to my family situation and sometimes held it against me.
bad,"Working as a team member here didn't feel very inclusive at all. There was an incident that made me uncomfortable, too uncomfortable to continue as the only female cart attendant, one the managers didn't care too much for employee security."
bad,"Ok too work management needed to be nicer to employees especially in front of customers better break room, cleaner restrooms, treat all employees the same."
bad,"Personally, I have not had the best experience working here in Target, however, I expect that that is because of the department I was placed in. I am in the clothing department and currently, a majority of the people in the department are not the best of people. Only the TLs and a few others are decent people."
bad,Very enjoyable atmosphere but horrible pay. Nice people to be around but not a career.
bad,"I worked nights, and it's busy as usual. Well i didn't understand the display. When i asked another co-worker""who as well had much to do"" for help. She didn't hesistate to drop what she was doing, and help me immediantly."
bad,"It is a great place to work at for your first job. Management needs some improvement because they are not always fast, fun and friendly. They tend to single people out, or pick favorites. They are really flexible with hours and availability."
bad,Management definitely show favoritism within this company. Moving up within the company is really easy if you show you care and put in effort in the tasks given to you. What makes the job easier is the team and management. If management has favorite leads and leaders it's no fun at all. At the time a lot was put on regular employees for such little pay.
bad,"Family oriented, the team members are nice, most of the team leaders are nice.  It's all about the numbers and how fast you put out the products on the shelves."
bad,"I loved working there wasn't crazy bout how late it was but overall it was good, the other employees are decent and I made a few friends too but then one day I accidentally drop a pallet on my foot cause I was rushing around and I called them LIKE IM SUPPOSE TO and they took me to medcore tbh I could've kept working but they didn't want that so that was on them anyway they had a hard time understanding what I was saying I even used a clipboard as a demonstration but they asked the same questions like 10 times. after they told me to go home I was off the rest of the week kinda bummed cause I like working there. then they asked bout it again and again like omg how many times do I have to explain it then my dad who used to work there when he was younger said they'll try to fire u anyway and that this injury was going to be enough. sure enough 3 days later they waited for me in the lobby and took me into a side room and I knew what it was and prior to my firing they hired and fired multiple people aka newcomers like me within a week they don't give u a chance at all but they said in orientation they give chances well obviously they lie their turnover rate is high. I was going to give this job a chance. when I was injured they said they could put me in another department but obviously that was a lie as well. overall working there is great but don't hurt yourself otherwise ur out of there and out of a good job."
bad,"always having something to do is the best part of being a cashier"
bad,"I love my job and it’s not that bad, management hr did not try with my requests sadly to move to a different department sadly. I will miss it. But I am leaving on a good note. Just in case I wanted to be hired again."
bad,"I worked at Target for 4 weeks as a seasonal team member and this was my first job. Working there  on hardlines was fun and there was always other opportunities to participate in. Everyone there felt like a 2nd family to me. I loved working there but management at my store was awful."
bad,I personally wouldn't recommend going there to work but that's my opinion.A lot of the employees have attitudes and are disrespectful. My supervisor was great though
bad,"I love working at target BUT there is little to none hours. 95% of employees are part time working only 15-25 hours a week if lucky. It is hard to move up to a ""team lead"" and get Full Time.. If you are not a ""Team Lead"" or any sort of supervisor/manager you will NOT be full time. There is no O/T as well."
good,"The big problem there's not enough hours for everyone, even you have an open availability. They prefer to give more hours the new team members."
good,"I didn’t feel like the managers really cared about me as an individual when I worked there. Several times the scheduling manager would schedule me for days when I was in school and couldn’t come in, and then made it my problem and I had to find a cover for it."
good,The manager here was the MOST rude person I've ever met... Very misunderstanding. Doesn't like to work around anyone's schedule but their own.. yells at employees around customers.. threatens job daily... Just e very messy business.
good,"Everyone, especially management is only out to save their own jobs, unrealistic expectations, rude, certain team leads get full time but dont even understand how to do their jobs. This specific target in Chesapeake needs a whole knew management team. Everyone there all the way up to gm need to be replaced. The only positive i had coming into work was two people i worked with. Every single other person there was at some point or another condescending and had an overall lack of repect for eachother. Associates were rude with management  had absolutely zero respect for anyone. Theyd rather you quit that move you to another department."
good,"I was hired for seasonal in September 2016. They loved the fact that I was picking up shifts every week decided to keep me permanently. The TLs, LODs, and HR were absolutely horrendous and would retaliate for any sort of issue that left them feeling wronged. Flash forward to March 2018 I had just found out I was pregnant and had terrible health issues. The whole time I was admitted in the hospital they gave me an impossible time with calling out/forcied me to find my own coverage. The first 4 shifts they scheduled for me after leaving the hospital were each 8 hours despite asking them to drop my hours significantly. They continued ignoring my health concerns until I just left."
good,From my first day there I wasn't given a warm welcome. People felt like I was hired and going to take their job or their hours. The management treated people based on how they liked them. So did the team members. They were not an inclusive place to work.
good,typical day is go in get assignments from manager and complete them in a timely manner.  time allotted was not always enough time to complete the task.  policy of asking every guest to sign up for the app and the credit application is a turn off.
good,Target's management was one of the worst. It was all politics and the upper management advanced only those supervisors that pushed the employees to unreal expectations by timing us on stocking the shelves. They also put their spies among us to report back to them.
good,I love shopping at target but they didn’t pay me as they should have and I was over worked and they didn’t care if u had family at home as long as u was there to work for them
good,My opinion one can't advance if you are a older worker.They think we know how to conduct business in the work place.Ive working in retailing for years. They really don't care about there employees like that they don't like good worker.If they don't like you they will make ypur job experience a nightmare.
good,You are worked like a slave labor. Management sucks as do other co workers! Not worth the time to work here move along and work else where as it sucks here!
good,"Worked in the clothes section for 6 months. If you’re a closer, you have to stay until every person in the store has finished their work. So if you work hard and get everything done, doesn’t matter because So-and-so in electronics took his sweet time all day. Now you have to finish your work and go help other departments for another 2 hours after close. If you are a stocker, they expect you to run to the front and cashier if it gets busy and then you get yelled at by your department manager because your task still isn’t finished. Discount is pretty low and at the time you could only use the discount if you paid cash. They do this to prevent you from getting a discount on any big purchases. Typical immature employees, most management are rude and lazy, customers are ridiculously entitled. I loved Target as a customer. After working there, you realize how ghetto and dirty it is. Check the dates on any food or medicine you buy."
good,"Target has their own ideas for everything and no opening for employees opinions. It is cut throat, either they like you or they don’t. They do mass hiring to weed out individuals over time who they do not wish to advance in the company."
good,"While I loved the company as a whole, the typical work day was met with a lot of factors that could either set you up for success or push you into absolute failure.  It all depends on your team, if you work with people who just don't care, your set up for failure.  If you happen to work with a team that actually cares about their job, you will succeed."
good,"Days would begin with stocking shelves, cashiering. Management did not know how to supervise employees. Management never learned my name. I worked there for 6 months. Worked on my own with no one to train me. Hardest part of job was customers.most enjoyable part of the job was playing with toys in toy department"
good,"It's not a bad place. They always seem to have what I need and more, prices are high but that's to be expected. Customer service to me is great. This place is definitely more friendly than other stores like Wal-Mart. Team members are nice and always welcoming."
good,The most competitive part of the job is getting customer to sign up for a Red Card because most people either don't want to sign up and aren't interested  or has tried to apply but are not approve. when we don't sign enough customer per week we get punish. So...Good Luck and put your customer service face on. :)
good,"Not enough workers, cut your hours, poor management. Say good bye to your weekends or you're fired. No teamwork just look out for yourself so good luck."
good,Bad place to work if you are in South Lebanon Ohio. They brought new manager in and she was horrible. They went to investigate her and she quit then after 50 people were either fired or quit. One he fired was in the hospital at the time.
good,Of course there's always a manager you don't like at any job you work at. Unfortunately at the store I work at has multiple managers that won't give you the time of day unless you're constantly stroking their ego. It's been paying the bills only recently since I had to have another job at a gas station but had to quit that job because all my other coworkers at Target quit on me. Now that I have the hours I'm working more duties than the actual manager does now except I don't get the pay of a manager.
good,The management was poor. The way they treated their employees was poor. The whole thing was poor. They made you feel terrible if you had a family emergency and had to miss work.
good,"Increased inside sales and product development on all T-Mobile cellular services"
good,Weren't willing to give hours and the illegally terminated me. Work environment was comfortable and coworkers were very helpful to me. Management was ok
good,"Target was also very serious, get your job done and go home type of place. I did not enjoy working there. The break room always played new movies but you never had the time to watch them all the way."
good,This job is great for high school kids it teaches alot about the work force before heading out into the world to find a career.
good,very childish. Every one was dating everyone. You dont need skill to be promoted you would have to be dating someone or are a favorite. Management were very catty and childish and didnt care if you had a 103 fever they wanted what they wanted done. I learned patience with this company because it was horrible
good,"I have worked at Target for 7 years. When I first started there I could see myself being there for a very long time. I am very very part time. Meaning, I work an average of 15 hours per week, IF THAT. I also work full time somewhere else, but I use this job as extra cash in my wallet. Unfortunately, I have seen my store gone down hill VERY quickly especially after this past holiday season. My store manager is a JOKE. He cares NOTHING about the team members and all about the guests, which I find absolutely crazy. He cut hours THE WEEK AFTER CHRISTMAS. Since then, the hours have not been the same. The week of christmas I worked 32 hours, the week after I was down to about 15. You DO NOT have a set scheduled. You are sometimes there until about 11:45pm after your scheduled time. You are not guaranteed hours that you would like and not guaranteed full time. You will not get benefits unless you worked over 20 hours per week."
good,Working at Target is for students that need money for supplies. A person with a family cannot only work at Target because the pay is not great and not enough hours. The best about Target is all the product knowledge received from all departments.
good,"A typical day at work will include high stress and sore feet. It's nearly impossible to move anywhere in this store (That includes promotions or transferring stores or just departments) unless you have a close friendly relationship with one or more superiors. Their is a lot of favoritism in this store which is insulting and the constant harassment for employees to get red cards is pathetic. No matter how good you are at your job, how many rave reviews you get from the customers, if you don't get people to apply for a store credit card, you're not worth much to Target."
good,"At first, I really enjoyed this job. However, throughout the years management changed many times. The younger the management got, the worse the store was run. No confidentiality when you discuss issues. Many of the upper management were under 25 and it was their first job out of college. Thry had no idea what they were doing. They stick together like a high school clique."
good,Not a comfortable place to work. Nobody really cares about their job they're all just there for a check.
good,"Supervisors very nice. Helpful work place. pay decreased after remodel was over could not stay with low pay, "
good,"After 8 years, my responsibilities were increased, hours cut, expected to do 100% increase in workload in 1/4th the time. Tried to request transfer numerous times, They would write me up for something I was trained to do. Each manager told me different  clock in times, where to be & when, without notifying me they changed their minds again. Too many managers, all telling me to do something different. Management wouldn't consult with one another & be on same page. They would change the rules day by day."
good,Target do not train the new employess very well but have very high expections of them.
good,No time for standing around. Management needs improvement.
good,Cashiering is a fulfilling position that allows me to enocunter a diverse set of people. I learned more problem solving skills and enjoyed learning neww skills from other employees. Management was rarely visible. The hardest part of the job is trying to obtain enough working hours to maintain finances.
good,"•	Responsible for developing film, cleaning photo machines, as well as adding developing chemicals as needed"
good,The job was fun but the management was terrible. If the store had better management then the job would be better.
good,"I learned a lot working at Target in the Logistics department. Management was lacking in many departments. They did not train their employees well at all. Other co-workers are left to train new employees without being asked. When hired you are told of your schedule, when you go into orientation, you are given a different schedule, and when you actually clock in you actually work a lot longer than your supposed to. They do not work with you and your schedule. There were many times when some employees who have been there for awhile would purposefully do things to make your job harder and hurt you. Management would always turn a blind eye to these people. I liked my job and i loved my co-workers but unfortunately it was not enough to get me to stay"
good,"They are never willing to work with your schedule. Target is suppose to be all about school and family, but are unwilling to give you the days off you need to go to school to get a real education. There is no room for advancement. When they hire a manager or supervisor, they hirer outside of the company, they don't even consider anyone who has been there for two plus years. Management looks down on you like you are dirt."
good,"learned how to stock shelves,but the hardest part was rushing against time and getting ready for the Holidays."
good,"Typical day was very busy and handling multiple things at once, management were nice and they tried to make work fun to be at but still making sure you do your job. hardest part of the day is just getting through it, a lot of repitition."
good,If you are looking for a great part time gig or your just startig out in the work force Target is a great place
good,i worked at target twice for the Christmas season as a second job it was ok for a short time. but not as your only job. if you are asked to stay after the Christmas they call it full time but its realy part time with 24 hours or less a week
good,I was only there for short of a month it was very far i lived in sp an the location was somewhere on Roosevelt Blvd there break times are unreasonable by the time you clock out for break your already five minutes into your break and the lockers are small. Also they had no compassion for the workers catching the bus five minutes will not break target.
good,"The company doesn't care about its employees but at least it's better than working for Walmart.  They don't see employees as actual people, just sources of labor."
good,"After the last store manager came in, our sales went down and we started having all kinds of accidents in the backroom, because she didn't enforce cleaning but wanted to yell at everyone about accidents. She came in trying to be everyone's friend, instead of being an authority figure and people took advantage. Then everyone started quitting, back to back."
good,"be very very specific with your availability.  I said I was available to work any time on Saturday or Sunday and so every week end they scheduled me at 4 in the morning.  I thought I would get assigned that early since the overnight crew was an entirely different application and I had already opted out of working overnight.  They wouldn't let me change my availability since I was under ""probation""."
good,They started changing things in store got rid of peoples jobs and then started weaning the older associates out for yonger stronger employees.. Was a good company in the beginning then managers started changing rules day by day
good,"if you want a job where you'll be paid barely anything for doing EVERYONE'S job then yeah, apply here. Poor management, lack of communication from higher roles, overall bad place to work."
good,Working at Target I didn't get many hours the most hours I would get for each shift I had would be 4 hours and I would only work two times a week and I had talked to my manager about seeing if I can get more hours she said of course but I never got more hours
good,They dont appreciate the associates in any way they dont recognize the good workers from the bad ones. Too much work for little pay and the raise was not even worth it that would only give you about 7-10cents
good,"With the new modernization everyone is stressed out and unhappy except the ETL’s & Store Director. Work load is way to big to accomplish, always being told what you did wrong never props for a job well done. All the new leads have come from outside the store when there’s plenty inside wanting to grow. I was told you have to groom yourself when asking to promote a GSA to a SETL. I was a Hardlines Team Lead then a Service and Engagement Team Lead. I was very unhappy given the SETL position and put in my notice after 2 months of telling them I didn’t want that position and then not listening. Management needs to find the balance of empathy and leadership. My store director was a robot. I would only recommend Target to people looking for experience and not a career. They will not work with you, your schedule or growth. It’s their way or the highway."
good,"Low pay for part-time. Worked 40 hr weeks and was only part-time. Constantly standing no breathers. Rough work environment, don’t work here unless you want to sweat everyday at work."
good,It’s a great place to work for someone who just needs an extra few dollars. If you’re wanting to pay your bills you’ll have to work two jobs. The new management sucks but customers are nice and friendly as well as other team members.
good,Not good. At first I loved it but then started to be looked down upon for my knowledge of the shifty store. They ended up terminating me for reasons unknown...
good,"When I first started at target we had a great upper management staff. Over the two and a half years I worked for my particular store all but two of the management positions changed. Many of those positions changed more than once with younger people. Bring in younger management is a good thing, however when everyone is new at their positions then everything g is a mess. The store is now always understaffed and a hectic mess. This makes customers unhaply and they yell at the team members, who have no control over staffing, and not the upper management who make the schedules. It was a great place to work for the first couple months, until they started to bring in inexperienced new graduates all at once."
good,"When I started I loved the company but the last year or so things have been slowly turning towards the worst. They no longer care about employees and just want you to show up, punch the clock, and leave. They don’t care about well being you are just a number and condsidered replaceable."
good,"There is a calendar in the break room that has all of the special ""Celebration"" days.  Like National Doughnut day, National Pizza day, and so on.  At Christmas they give you makings for PB&Js."
good,"An average day is 8.5 hours long, and you get two 15 minute breaks and a half hour for lunch. You could expect a fairly busy day. The management is very childish, meaning you are in a popularity contest. And if your in then you are fine, otherwise you wont like working there. I enjoyed the end of the day and my breaks where I could go to my car and be by myself."
good,Horrible management. Retail can be miserable. The management can be unfair. Workplace culture is constantly changing. The hardest  part of the job is working long hours without a break. The most enjoyable part of the job is being appreciated by happy customers.
good,"This Target's Distribution Center of Cedar Falls. As a warehouse worker, I had to learn the loading/unloading process in a collaborative spirit. To perform the daily task, physical performance was a must. The job was so demanding in term of trailer to unload on daily basis."
good,"Target has no concern for family. They will feed you endless lip service about health and well-being, but all of their actual actions prove that these things don't actually matter in their culture."
good,I wouldn't recommend working there. You are demanded a lot with little guaranteed hours. The work/life balance is a joke. I worked every Thanksgiving for 8 years!!! It was MANDATORY!!!
good,"Target was a decent place, too many chiefs not enough Indians, I was hired full time but I never got close to part time hours a week. Promises of hours getting better kept me their as long as I stayed. the schedules were for me erradatic at best opening one day, next afternoon hours, to closing the next.  That's how it was from day one, management ect tends to show favoritism"
good,"This would be a great job if you are a cashier. Otherwise you are expected to do 50-60 hours of work in a 40 work week. This same job in other companies would be paying dollars more. Most status conversations are how you didn't finish, not focusing on what you did. Executive staff takes ridiculously long breaks together, this seems to be company wide. Lack of support across the board.  "
good,"Not worth trying to work there if you want to live on your own, no advancement. Not enough hours of work, have to work desperately hard to get a few extra hours"
good,"I told them prior to being hired that I was going to be gone for a week the following month."
good,"Management cut hours to all ""older"" employees even though I was hired as a 32+ hr employee. Most of the better employees were forced to find other employment to survive."
good,"One of the worst jobs I've every had. GM lied about the money that could be made, The location I worked at had the rudest mangers (target managers). Always short staffed"
good,"When I informed my managers that I was pregnant, they still had me doing heavy lifting. They have astronomically high expectations and give zero recognition when you come remotely close to their expectations."
good,"My local Target can't seem to keep any employees or managers. I understand that retail is a fast paced business, but they will over work the staff. Everyone walk around with attitudes all day long and you will barley catch a smile. If you apply for target because of the pay, that's great but if you want a friendly fast paced environment to work then your wasting your time applying for Target."
good,"Target, despite being such a successful company, does not give any benefits to their workers unless you average more than 35 hours a week over the course of the year. Meaning, firstly, that you must be there a year to even have a chance to have health coverage. Secondly, they try their hardest to make sure that no one except management and HR are present enough hours. More often than not, they will schedule you for no more than 20-25 hours in a week - if that much- and if you want more, you must go through a list on the wall of shifts that others want to give away. It is so stressful to try to get consistent hours unless you are in, say, the price management team, and even then during the holidays you are pushed into the regular sales associate role, cut down to 20 or so hours. It's ridiculous."
good,Pretty cutthroat place to work. Managers and team leader are horrible at giving tasks. Make you do 8hours worth of work in only 4 hours. I would recommend this job as a temporary job.
good,They expect a lot from you even when its not in your job description. They will place you wherever they need you. They also get upset when you use the sick hours yule worked hard for.
good,It was difficult to have consistent hours due to home office taking away hours because we did not meet sales goals. They hired too many people but did not properly schedule.
good,"Cashiering for the day, greeting customers and being positive goes along way. Communication between management and employees is very bad. They also promise hours and then you don’t get them. Hire new staff and they get your hours. And employees that got hired before them get cut hours. Hardest part of my job was attitudes of other co workers. Best part was enacting with the public."
good,they are very disrespectful. horrible experience overall and i wouldnt recommend this deadend job full of old people who dont know what progression is.
good,Self paced environment with a lot of work to get done in a small amount of time .Manger does work with you and plus any other staff incase he isn't able to answer any questions or concerns .
good,"Loved my job and what I did, but the managers were absolute children. I once spent 6 hours setting up a model just to be told it looked terrible. They expect you to do a million things at once and they literally walk around the store doing nothing. Do NOT let the pay blind you. It’s such a stressful place to work that plays favorites."
good,I started out working over 40 hours a week and was happy to be a target team member but after the manager retired and a new manager strait out of college took over cut my hours to two three hour shifts and was expected to do more in those 3 hours.
good,I like my job but not enough hours when your a mother with two kids to support  they always hire tons of people but nobody gets good hours you need to be a team leader to get 40 hrs they always say they need to cut hours regular employees who do most of the work then management get the end of the stick
good,"early start time with 5:30 am shifts to unload trucks and stock shelves, extremely fast pace. to have the store ready before 8 am opening of the store"
good,The pay at this job was very bad and my supervisor was very rude and verbally abusive. The discount at this place was only 10% for employees. I felt no job security here.
good,"No advancement for team members in certain areas and if that, you can't get a leadership position for years. They hire external leadership all of the time instead of trying to cultivate talent within the store. There is talent available, but I don't know why they aren't considered. I made the decision to leave because I needed more for my life."
good,Not a great long term place. Management is terrible and they overstaff in order to cut hours. Even after 7 years of work when you finally leave they will hardly give you a goodbye.
good,"Not a stable work place "
good,I've enjoyed working her but I also want something better for me. I see this as a temporary  job and even though I have been their for 6 yrs now I think it's time for me to move on and get something better
good,"I applied for backroom merchandise order puller and instead they put me on the 4am shift to unload trucks & stock shelves. The pay is horrible for the amount of work they expect you to do. Whether you're on a team of 20 or 6 they still rush you to complete the same amount of work in 4 hours before the store opens. The managers are a joke as well, they expect you to work any shift they feel regardless of the schedule you may have for school or your family. The co-workers aren't friendly and no one either bothers to help you out, even though the company brags about teamwork. Don't waste your time working for this company."
good,"Working pace is great, I learned a lot about team work. Management is a little disorganized. Had problems with trying to work around my school schedule."
good,"I don't mind shopping there but it's the kind of place you work because you need money but you escape as soon as you can. It's not a career, don't get trapped there."
good,"I learned that I work better under pressure, how to deal with difficult guest and people in general. I liked the people but working for target the managers treat the employees poorly."
good,"Terrible place to work.  Customers were awesome but the constant haranguing by supervisor regarding ""Red Cards"" was so deflating."
good,"Working was a pain. Everyone was every where, and there were not that many hours. There were too many employees which decreased the hours even more. I was happy to be only seasonal."
good,"was not there long enough to ever appreciate the retail store as a night stocker., but do feel that the store as a shopper is ok"
good,"We are busy every now and then but the managers dont ever give breaks on time, we cant have closed bottles of water at register, it gets really hot upfront to where it can make someone light headed,"
good,"It was an in-between type of job, something to have just to survive one, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except someone really down on their luck and like to have their sleeping patterns screwed up."
good,"Target is a great company to work for, to get by, unfortunately I do not see it being a workplace with career options. I picked up many skills in customer service, team work, communication, Human Resources etc. The management is the main reason I have decided to seek new career options. The people that work their are great, Target has a very diverse team."
good,If your looking for a high paying job then this is the wrong place to go. There are too many managers that do not know how to communicate and they love to throw you under the bus.
good,"Great company culture to start with. Motivating and amazing FFF culture (Fast, Fun & Friendly) But once the store opens and the daily grind settles in, life at Target tends to go South very quickly. TL's (Team Leaders) turn into irritable, micro managers who hover and push which in turn, makes the average Joe (Team Member) work even slower. Not to mention, if the TL's don't like you (as a person) they tend to cut your hours down to bare minimum in the hopes you'll quit and go somewhere else."
good,"My typical day on the job consisted of counting inventory and occasionally helping unload the merchandise from the truck.  The days I had to help unload the truck I could not complete my regular duty of counting the stores stock.  I learned a lot about being patient and organizing my day.  You have to be a self starter and motivated at all times for this job.  My co-workers were the best, always friendly and willing to give a hand when needed.  The hardest part about the job was dealing with management.  It always seemed as though they did not know what direction they were supposed to lead you in."
good,"I haven't been at target quite a year yet, and the overall atmosphere make you just not want to be apart of it at all."
good,"I have been working for target for almost a year. In the beginning, I loved working with an awesome team and work was very enjoyable. I wanted to learn everything, and my Team Leads were very receptive to my ideas. When my store location had closed down, I transferred to a nearby Target. I always arrive to work on time and ready to do my work. However, working at this particular location is not enjoyable, the team members are rude and our Team leads are not very appreciative. Whenever I ask to work in a different area, I am told there isn't any positions available. Working the sales floor or the fitting room is all I do, and I want to learn more and do more."
good,it was a nice place to work at first than thing started to change they didnt like to work with you if you had things come up in your life..
good,"Ringing customers up and cleaning the front end. Most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers, it always made the day easier when you liked the people you worked with. The managers were never really around, the customers were rude."
good,"Good place to get experience and training. "
good,A typical day at target is great co-workers are struggling as much as anybody else with minimal pay. The hardest part of the job is the lack of hours to get the job done. The most enjoyable would be the guests children that come in everyday almost and say hello by name. 
good,"Horrible Management, Schedule Issue, Nice/Helpful Coworkers"
good,"I understand its a business, but needs to be more compelled to associates, in order to keep good workers."
good,"Too many ""ETL""s hovering over the employees that don't need to be watched and not keeping their eye on the NON-Workers who get by not doing they're share. Advancement>not. Always hiring new employees, cutting into other employees hours, that is if the new employee even shows up for one day, only to quit after one day."
good,"It stated out as a temp job and six years later . Hours would go down at the begining of the year but, they would hire new people ????"
good,duties were the same each day.management was good.co-workers were nice.
good,Did daily inventory of merchandise on hand.
good,the pay is not good for the work they have you doing its hard to get promoted i have a degree and i don't want to let it go to waste the best par t of the job is the teamwork and getting to go home you might get a high pay per hour but they hardly let you work if your lucky you'll get 3 days to work even doe u applied for full time work sometimes i only get one day of work how am i suppose to support my family working one day this sis so outragous
good,"Good place to work, good people, interesting and some room for advancement, just not enough hours."
good,I worked for target when i was still in high school. This being my first job i felt that it was an ok place to work
good,The job is a good learning tool for young people stating out. As for those of us who have worked in warehouses its testing when you have a manager who doesn't have the experience tell how to do a job your capable  of preforming on your own. Managers need to work in the positions they are managing.  Learn the job then teach it.
good,"I was unfairly let go, from this company and I chosen not to fight the issue cause I didn’t want to deal with them anymore. It was cool up until I was let go."
good,"if you land at a target, you will meeting great employees that will help each other out. "
good,"I enjoyed working there while I was there. The hours were not that great, I wish there were more. I had previous retail experience that I was able to use there. The management team were easy to work with."
good,I worked for target distribution for a few months and was actually happy they gave me the boot. The job can be nice with certain employees you meet but there was a lot of favoritism especially with women employees. there are times when I meet my quota only to be told by a new OM that I wasn’t moving at a pace they wanted but we never really have a pace rather it was hard to get one cause of the favorites who often leave unfinished caddies in the aisles then when you have to pick them up you end up pulling four instead of two then they all of a sudden come up and ask you to flex back to the first aisle while they push the ones you finish. Of course the OMs see it’s your fault for being slow. Management is nonexistent and it for some reason I still haven’t received my final check it’s been two weeks.
good,"On top of being buried in work and never receiving help for it, essentially they shoved massive amounts of responsibility to people that shouldn't have to have it soley alone. There should be two people per department if they expect someone to be able to get a weeks worth of work done in 6 hours per day, while helping customers, and trying to answer phone calls, or back-up cashier. "
good,I was always put at one of the registers that was far from the other cashiers.  Never had help until they saw I had a long line  This was every time I had to work
good,"I fell between 2 managers, first one was good and a proper manager, the store was gaining in the Target ranks. The second was to youg , did not like older people working for her and the store has suffered, I do not even shop there."
good,"I work at target in Grand Rapids MN, employees are all treated differently, very passive aggressive, not clear on directions. No one can advance their positions here. They play favorites, don’t follow company policies, and the level of accountability and expectations is placed depending on who you are ( level of closeness to the team leads). The scheduling is also poor. Really not much I can say that’s nice about this store, it’s not being run well."
good,"Management was a joke, and made it almost impossible to move up or get better at any aspect of the job. Management was lazy and handed all responsibility over to lower members as they talked with each other and sat around at the Starbucks located in our site."
good,It was not as productive as i thought it was a fun place to work managers was pretty good but it is kinda hard to move up in the company alot off turnover
good,Management is poorly run. Employees are not treated fairly or well. Hours are hardly given. Genuinely just stressful and difficult job to be happy at.
good,"A lot of favoritism, no set schedule, won’t really work with you if you’re going to school and if you are they’ll cut your hours. You do get time off and sick pay but that accumulates as you work there, you aren’t starting off with certain days/hours"
good,"I worked for target part time, they where very flexible and very kind at first when they changed managers things changes and went down hill, now mandatory to work full shifts and many of us that worked part time had to leave."
good,Management are there to push you to work harder to accomplish an impossible amount of tasks in a very limited amount of time.  Promotions where given based on who sucked up the most not how actually earned the promotion.
good,"Everyone is in charge of their own departments. "
good,"The experience was great until the manager quit. They do not pay attention to your availability and there’s nothing you can really do about it. I was called into the office to discuss my “no-call-no-show” where I found out my manager never told anyone that I ever called in (a day in advance). "
good,"Management was unreasonable, I had a medical issue come up and had to be hospitalized and even though I called in as soon as it happened and provided them with paperwork They still tried to fire me"
good,"Management was a joke. They were passive aggressive, and if you never stayed and worked later they would haunt you by not giving you hours. There was no medium. It was either 5 hours a week for a month, or 39.5 hours a week for 4 months. There was no consistency and if you went over 40 hours you never heard the end of it and they would not schedule you anyway near 40 hours again in fear that you would go over and they have to pay you overtime. No room to move up because they do no promote inside even if you do everything they ask, come in on your days off, stay until the sun went down or left when the sun came up, they used you until you’d quit or just drop dead."
good,Working long hours can sometimes be very stressful especially when we be short staffed since the store is always busy and sometimes the guests can be very rude at time if they don’t get there way
good,"Very quick paced environment. Started as a temporary employee during Pre-Christmas rush. Have been trained on many different areas of the store, so that when an employee is out or has left company they have trained personal."
good,The job promised was made available in the beginning/hours/ after training the available hours i received diminished drastically. Therefor I was also seeking alternate employment.
good,ok place to work not enough hours/ dont pay enough/ give hours to new people instead of ones already there. need to listen better to employees about what will work in the store
good,"The company went from having long term employees that cared and knew their jobs, to, spend a few hours training and they are on their own. If they don’t workout then pull-up the next application. And the trainers are the employees  hired the month before not the long term employees. More work less hours to do it in to cut back on benefits all to justify increasing mimium wage. Get all the product out no matter the presentation. Worry about what it looks like only when you get CEO visits. They call us team members but there is very little teamwork going on. It’s every man or woman for themselves. At present the most enjoyable time at work, hitting the time clock on my way out. It wasn’t always like this."
good,"The pay is good for the job, but management does not care about your well being. They will also put a huge work load on you and then get mad if you cant finish it in a short time period. They will not cross train you even if they say they will. There is only full time benefits and no flexible scheduling."
good,"If you wanna get paid next to nothing and be demanded by management to do everything there is to do, then Target is for you. Terrible place to work. Terrible."
good,"I worked at target for over a year. In my year of working there, things were unorganized and stressful. We were constantly understaffed and overworked."
good,You won't get far unless you are already going to school and want to be a Lead. Use it more as a stepping stone and not a career or a long term job. The hours you get won't make a living by a long shot
good,"Can't say much for day shift but I did enjoy working nigts, no customers to deal with so you could just zone out and stock shelves. the pay was bad but thats what you expect at a place like Target."
good,"Fast pace, fun but yet stressful, do not tell your business, do not join in on gossip, stay focus, learn as much as you can while there. Great discount benefits."
good,"The job itself is Just ok! The problem with this job is that your expected to sell red cards all the time without getting any commissions. Also, Target lost the trust of it customers when all the credit cards got hacked. That made all the cashiers jobs harder. Getting yelled  at by customers all day because they thought target was to sale their information was hard. "
good,Pretty unfair most of the time. Managers just talk and dont do anything. Its very stressful when no one does what theyre supposed to do and everything gets piled for you to do
good,"poor management "
good,"I was told on several occasions that I HAD to work late, with no notice even though my managers were fully aware of my need to be off at a certain time to get my child."
good,"Not a consistent work environment. Only advantage is that scheduling can be flexible. With the new modernization of Target, I've had multiple guests tell me that the store was messy and reminded them of Walmart."
good,I learned the fast pace of logistics in retail and there is so much more the sales that makes a retail company function. In order the the entire company to well with sales every team must do their job efficiently.
good,"It was a decent place to work.  However, in the two years I was there, the Flow team almost had 100% turnover rate.  No one seemed to like working early mornings.  I did not mind."
good,"In the beginning of working at target I had high hope like I wasn't planning on leaving that job. I was getting paid good money and the hours were there when needed. So you get a car and you're paying rent now all of a sudden theres no more hours and can't keep up with bills and have a life. So it's not a bad place to work, it just doesn't work for me."
good,Management never realized how much work we put into trying to make the best situation for our customers. We were often understaffed and most definitely underappreciated.
good,"Target is pushing to become leader in all areas. Focus on this throws expectations of new  procedures that are POORLY if even taught. There is NO training, and communication is non existent. The role of the area I work in changes daily, workload has increased 50% and hours have  decreased across the board. "
good,"A typical day at work was early and average around eight hours day five days a week, almost thirty-eight hours a week, but rarely forty hours. You work super hard and clean up everyone else's mess. Management was so not into confrontation you got emailed pictures that said fix this sent to every manager in store with your name on it. Hardest part of the job is that every other employee including managers thought that my department was their whipping boy. Oh and when you want to advance its a big show of  who knows who better not who deserves it more. I loved the atmosphere and how some of my coworkers tried hard to make the environment way better."
good,Always at the register and always trying to sell the credit/debit card they have and helping customers. But we were always understaffed and almost hit lunch violation multiple times because of them needing me at the register.
good,"If you stay busy, the day will go by quickly. If you don't agree with management, its best to keep it to yourself (despite the ""open door"" policy and constant assurance that they want to hear you out). Great peers to work with and not difficult work. Hardest part of the job would be the common double work caused by contradicting management requests. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is discount and pay. Its what make it worth putting up with questionable ""leadership""."
good,"it was ok managent has changed a lot from when i started. it not a work life balance place to work for anymore, its all about dollars and cents not a great new look."
good,"although you're paid minimum wage, and seasonal, you're asked to understand all the processes of the entire company and if you don't well that's too bad"
good,Good work environment just not enough hours a week no room for advancement managment plays favorites other than that its an ok place to work at coworkers are awesome
good,"I like a job where I can interact with my customers and my co workers, where I work at everyone only care about themselves no one would help me if I needed help. I learned and still learning everything on my own."
good,You are seen as a number. They don’t work with you with anything and management is the worst. They don’t work with school schedules unless they have the coverage on the shift. When mandatory OT starts they can work you up to 72 hours a week. Worker that are there 10 hours get the same amount of breaks as the workers that work 12 hours. You get a total of an hour in breaks for working 12 hours.
good,"Lots of work, small raise, not a lot of opportunity to grow. You will probably learn multiple positions and not get paid for everything you're qualified to do."
good,Benefits are not that great. Hours fluctuate from as little as 10-60 hours. Not much opportunity for advancement. Management has a high turnover rate. Can not leave the DC's for lunch.
good,"This is a great job if you are in high school or if you need a temp job. The hours are minimal and the pay is minimum wage. I didn't really deal with high upper management only team leads and they were very stressed, they acted like if you didn't do you work or you were slow at it that it was affecting them personally."
good,A decent temporary job. Only part time jobs are offered. The pay is low and no advancement jobs are offered. Target has low security measures in their checkout pay registers and many people have had their identity at risk.
good,"I am not going to write a review, because of the reprocussions it has on your career at Target.   But in the beginning it was a great place to work and I learned a lot."
good,Worked at Target seasonal around Thanksgiving time stay there till the end of Christmas they said they were hiring people to stay on and they only kept the people that were permanent and they let all the seasonal people go they didn't give a raise I've also worked at Target previously part-time they don't like to give raises the management is really unfair at times and there is definitely no advancement to supervisor without being there over 3 years
good,Store Manager is Horrible i wouldn't recommend unless job part time or for holidays.The CoWorkers Are easygoing and customers are great (not all) but most.
good,"It was great utilizing my customer service skills in an environment I was familiar with. However, with so much change with management within the corporation and store itself, there was no room for professional growth or  advancement."
good,"It is a great place for a first job, but it can get very stressful very quick. idk what else to say about it, they're alright i just wouldnt recompend it for anyone that cant take people honding them day in and day out"
good,"Target is such a beautiful place to shop. The store is organized and products are relatively easy to find. But when working for the company, life looks a lot different. Super Target (Perimeter) was hard to work at because of management. The store manager was rude and set unrealistic goals and grew snappy as you got to know her. She treated the ""lowest"" of employees like cashiers and cart-attendants as if they were slaves. The management under the store manager wasn't much better. They were a very rude and condescending when you didn't agree with their perspective on different subjects. The LODs were like a clique of people that you would believe to like you once second and talk about you the next. Working there felt like high school all over again."
good,"We would arrive to work , get assigned , to different departments. Then an hour in to our shift they would send us home saying there was no work..!! Or they would have us cles=an or they would send us home"
good,"This position was very easy, the team was great. The target employees for the most part were good and hard working. I have been harassed twice working in this position which forced me to leave for my own peace."
good,It was always more to do with less time to do it. NO OVERTIME EVER!!!!! The management at this store was always doing something else when they were needed.
good,the managers didn't care about you. and they asked way to much for way to little pay. i did like it at first but them the manager told me that i couldn't work with a friends so they isolated me for no reason.
good,Working at Target is a great place to work if your looking to work in sales or looking for a second job to make extra money. Overall Target is a great place to work if you like to interact with people.
good,"wasnt there long enough to find out about benefits, but from what I did see when I was there the people there treated you as outsiders and they had their own little groups going."
good,Long boring days with people complaining all the time. I didn't really learn much or grow as a person.No positive vibes everyone hates there job and it make you hate it more.
good,"Bad management, bad pay,no hours to give,Management had quick turnover,very aggresive with employees and talked down to associates and reminded them they are replaceable constantly.Flow team was forced to do work quicker then possible to cut down on hours by sending people home before scheduled time off."
good,"But who has the time?"
good,"Gossipy Cashiers; Impolite Workers; More concerned if their co workers are ""Prettier then Them"" than job performance. No real Training for new workers."
good,"I worked at target for going on 3 years. I couldnt figure out as to why i didnt quit earlier then what i did. The people that are hired have a very low life view. The job area, including managment is all about gossip and thats also how you move up in the job change. The more you gossip and throw people under the bus thats how you climb to the corporate ladder."
good,"Target is okay to work for. The worklife balance and pay is really difficult though. Ive worked here for awhile now, and getting promoted is very difficult."
good,It was a cool job but the customers and management made it unenjoyable. The money was not good. The employees were lazy and rude.I would not recommend this job.
good,I would not  recommend target to any one.. the hours are not good the management is not far. they pick who works longer (8 hours) when everybody 8 -12 hrs  I can say..
good,"I loved the people and the job was amazing, but the fact that I never worked 40hours per week was very annoying. I applied for a full-time position and even though they promised me hours, they never did give me them."
good,At least the one I worked at was a mess. Constently being pulled into gossip and petyiness from team members. No appreciation. Management would gossip in front of team members about team members.
good,"greet and assist guests with their needs."
good,It has it days where sometimes it sucks but then it has it days when its alright but other than that I can get by it. Its a place to start a job i believe.
good,"Professional. They require some college (or in college) if you want to promote. It doesn't matter how much experience you might have you can't promote if you don't have some type of college under you. Even do you are then assign to train that person with the college degree. They also claim to work with you when it comes to scheduling and that they are flexible, not true you have to jump through hoops to get time off or they make you beg others coworkers to switch or if they do something for you some how your in debt with them. (San Luis Obispo)"
good,I've worked for Target for over 9yrs and my experience being an employee is that Target is not a place for people who are looking for growth or a career.
good,The same thing every day. Nothing really changes. The managers tend to make you do most of the work. Work environment isnt the best. Retail in general is not all that.
good,"Working in the portrait studio was not the best experience. The management wouldn't work with schedules. There was no ""real"" training on how to get patrons the best photos that they were paying for. Training was mostly ""point and click""."
good,I worked at Target in Chicago when it opened as the first big box store in an urban area. it was job for what it was need ed for. I learned how to do many things. But this place doesn't promote the right employees based on the right things. there was a lot of political and BS
good,Advancement is poor within the company. No room for growth. They expect you to work 60+ hours and 70+ during the holidays! The big guys at corporate are pocketing the money and not paying their team members.
good,"I've worked for Target for 4 years now and one thing I've noticed is the distinct lack of communication between ""Team Leads"" and employees."
good,"Worked with this company for 8 years . Watched them go through upper management like flies. Way too much favoritism going on ! Pay is very low as a team leader. Too much work is put on the team leaders while the executive team the managers sit in their office and eat all day and chat. They almost never come out on the sales floor  and never seen helping with any tasks . They hire managers that have never worked a job in their lives who are fresh out of college. You end up training them and than they micro manage you . Expect to stay longer at closings and Holidays and to b told to cut the hours you stayed . Don't get hurt on the job they will find a way to fire you . Think of it like this the fraise ""expect more pay less""  is you expect more out of the job and they use you like a slave and pay you less."
good,"If you are seeking advancement and work life balance, this is not the right place. In order for any advancement it is difficult to move up, unless you know someone one. Hardwork does not count."
good,The managers are very rude they are racist and they don't really care about the employees working there I couldn't take it they are just horrible. Don't want to ever work there again soon they will be going out of business
good,"Retail - Nights, Weekends and holidays you are at work - Payroll is minimal and will not meet the workload needs."
good,"it was a fast pace environment, always something to do. but you have to be able to deal with various personalities, super low wages"
good,"Co-workers were great. The management of the company was horrible. Team members were always coming and going, not lasting more than a few months. The environment wasn't welcoming so many new employees didn't last long. Older members would always complain but felt as though they were stuck there."
good,"The management is not professional at all. They get in team members faces and yell at them for not working hard enough, but then they sit in the break room most of the day. The team members are absolutely ten times better than the management, and some of them should be the managers. The team members are the only reason i enjoy working there at all. The managers have made everyone currently trying to find other jobs because of how disrespectful and unprofessional they are, even the store team leader. The hardest part of the job is not wanting to work there because of the managers."
good,My typical day was stocking the grocery department. I learned to order if necessary. Management was short tempered and often uncaring. Co-workers seemed bored and irritated with the job. The hardest part of the job was putting up with irate management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers.
good,I love Target but working for them no.  I learned real quick how things worked there.  Management Team some of them were nice and understanding others not so much.  Hardest part of working there trying hard to find a reason to stay.  Enjoyable part of the job the customers.
good,"The only good part about working at Target was the employees. We always had fun while working. I loved being a baker/ cake decorator, but management wasn't where it should be. I learned a lot while working for Target. It definitely isn't a permanent type place to work, not a lot of room for advancement. Great place to work during going to school and earning a degree."
good,Target sucks to work at. The discount is horrible and the management sucks.Overall it is most definitely a in between job while looking for something new.
good,"Typically yo would expect the authoritative body to be bias and handle all cases with equality but unfortunately not at the Super Target in Raleigh, NC. It would be a lie saying I didn't learn anything but the cons out weigh the pros. The co-workers are fine but pressured to forcefully promote the target cards regardless if its the same customer who came in three times in the store. The managerial body only tended to their personal benefits, no appreciation is showed towards the staff."
good,Working at Target was different I loved the interactions with the customers being able to help one another was pretty cool and the new people you meet on a daily
good,I normally work the weekends so it can be pretty busy and we are extremely understaffed so that adds a lot of stress to my job as well. Target is not a bad place to work but it's who you work with that makes your job enjoyable or not.
good,"I would reccommend this job for any young person wanting to get a job to enhance their finances, to learn responsiblity and see how to treat guests. I would not reccommend this for a person trying to survive with a family you just dont make enough and they wont pay any more"
good,"Customers are nice.Most of management is really nice but if you miss too many days regardless if you kids, you get a warning of one more call off your fired."
good,it was okay. a simple little job but management could be better. I just did my job and went home. I only worked like 3 hours i would have to battle other employees to get more hours and favoritism is really a problem.
good,"A typical day consisted of me clocking in, then running around trying to find someone to tell me where to go. I was asked constantly if I wanted to stay later than my shift. It got to the point to where a customer said no for me and told them that maybe they should hire more people. They basically lied to me about working with my schedule. I work another job that requires me to be on call for a week straight. They said that was find and told me to give them the days I couldn't work during my 2nd interview. I gave them that and they still scheduled me to work so I had to end up calling in. I feel they lied to me to get me to work on Thanksgiving and Black Friday.  I plan on quitting tomorrow since I'm on call again and I couldn't find anyone to cover for me. "
good,"This job is a physical job, which is what I like and enjoy. Pretty much every employee there is out for themselvs and throw you under the bus. People aslo don't communicate here either."
good,"I use to love going into work everyday until management kept changing. One boss had it out for me with an unknown reason to me. I was good at my job some say even better then certain upper management. My co-workers were awesome people to work with everyone has had their days, but overall they were really good people. Being here I gained a lot of experience, I have worked in the fitting room which I had to answer and direct phone calls to the proper department and I also had to keep up with my zone as well as look after who was coming in and out of the fitting rooms. While being a Guest Service TM I was able to cross train in many areas such as; Cafe, Guest Service counter, Cash Office, and I even had the opportunity to be supervisor for periods of times. Hardest part of the job was trying to convince guests to apply for credit/debit cards, many people already had them or didn't even care to have one. Everyday we were hounded to get these credit/debit card apps, it is in the job descrption, but I felt like I was soliciting the guests which would create a bad shopping experience. Working here for 4 years and trying to move up as a supervisor was the worst. I knew and my fellow coworkers knew I would be a great canidate, but like I said some management had it out for me. Management was really hard to talk to they act like they cared, but in the long run didn't do anything to help the situation. Or if there were complications between certain people they would pick sides instead of addressing the problem."
good,"Working for target is a very good starting job. You get paid minimum wage, or I did at least. But it was just an easy job to have when going to High school. I made money and went to school. However there is really no easy way to move up in that company. Plus management is HORRIBLE."
good,"It was ok until they reduced my pay. Work life balance does not exist. I would not recommend anyone work here unless they want to be stuck in the same position even after proving your work ethic, and value to the company."
good,horrible shift hours when working overnight not management structure
good,When going to HR they never anything and instead of them trying to help you they give a number to contact.  Bad employee services.  Also the Gl managers use the employees by making them work hard till they make them look good and they the managers get all the credit ....exploiters!!
good,"When I started at Target over a year ago it seemed like a wonderful place to work. I quickly learned that is not the truth. Management is all about ""feedback"" , never a positive note comes your way. It is always negative. They are so obsessed over their ""Red Cards"" that they don't see the bottom line. Not everyone wants a Target credit card, management pushes and pushes for this. If you are a cashier and you don't get enough red cards well, not good for you. I was told once based on my sales, on an average I wait on about 853 guests a week (this was right after Christmas) I should average about 44 red cards a week. Do they not take into account how many of these people already have a red card, how many are store employees, or the fact that some of these people I wait on multiple times in one week!? NOPE, bottom line they don't care about you, the guests or your other team members."
good,"unload truck, pull, backstock, stock merchandise, manage several departments on floor, special ad projects, plan-o-gram, manage backroom pulling and stocking heavy products."
good,"only good for students who needs part time job and they cross-trained you fast. Low pay, so no future here."
good,"can be good, but depends on the team members that you work with."
good,A good job to have while going to college. As a career not a good place to work at. Target does not hire within for assistant managers or managers. There is barely any medical or dental benefits.
good,I went to work did my job. Made some friends. Called it a day. I am a mam of few words. I was tout that you talk less work harder.
good,"Target started out being a great company to work for but toward the end, they stopped being about the employees and started being about the money and treated the little people like we didnt matter, they basically took away their own motto, fast fun and friendly"
good,This particular employer is only good for seasonal work.  I do not recommend this place for long term employment.  You will not receive 40 hours.
good,"Stock shelves, pull from shelves, unload trucks, assist customers, cashier. learned nothing from the job, management had no clue where anything was, they did always have a solution. Co-workers were great, very fun and energetic, extremely nice. hardest part of the job was working in the kids section, could never keep it clean. The kids would tear it apart. working in electronics was my favorite part of the job. Helping people buy games and explaining it to them was a blast."
good,Managed pricing team. Worked daily with team to accomplish  company goals.  The hardest part of the job was maintaining a staff who could complete the daily work load.  The most enjoyable part of the job was it was a difference challenge each day. I was always able to learn new things.
good,I love some of my co-workers they make the days/nights go by fast. There is no typical day at work because it fluctuates from day to day. I've learned so much about how a business runs from the day to day aspect as well as the things behind the scenes that you wouldn't think about goes on. The hardest part about my job is the guests in the store that can be a handful. The the flip side of that the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting different people from around the world.
good,Great team member loyalty between peers.
good,"I was a shipping and recieving clerk, i was responsible for filling the shelves with merchandise from the morning delivery."
good,they only offer part time placement and benefits but work you full time hours most of the time
good,Working as a cashier you have a great opportunity to meet very intelligent customers in which i call family because they mkae your day with their smiles.
good,"Management is detached and does not understand what the employees need to do their jobs successfully. You are always overworked because they refuse to give people the hours to work. They expect two cashiers, a photo lab person, guest service worker, and three people on the salesfloor to run the store while there are five management individuals sitting in the back chitchatting about what they did the day before. They are no help to their employees."
good,A typical at work here would start by clocking in and checking job board to see what area you was working in. I usually worked in target cafe. Hours always varied and depending on when you was schedualed to come in your job task differ.
good,Target was an ok job but I didnt really agree with the management because I believe in team work with members and management and at times it wasnt always like that
good,"cook, clean, sell, helping others, management needs work, hours horrible"
good,"não tenho muito o que falar, pois só fiz uma ação... a coordenações ajuda, companhias agradáveis, aprendi a lhe dar mais com pessoas, se paciente entre, outras.."
good,"The work its self is very self explantitory yet never challenged. Though i have learnt to be a little more patient. My co-workers are great and very easy to get along with and we all try to make each other laugh and smile to get us through slow shifts or a rainy day, when are just standing waiting on guests ready to check out. The hardest part, im really not sure there is one, and the most enjoyable part of working there is meeting new people everyday, and recognizing the guest that shop there often."
good,"A typical day at work , would consist of long, stressing hours that were usually filled with drama. The managers weren't much help , they were a title-based group of people. If you had a higher title , you typically got more respect."
good,I love my coworkers but I can't say the same about management. I did learn how to endure tough situations and how one peson can affect a team. The hardest part of my job was communicating with my leaders but I loved working with my team.
good,Good place to work especially if you like working with the public. You can learn a lot about retail and management if you apply yourself.
good,i like to shop at target but the target i worked at was in washington dc the hood... sorry to say but it was i only worked for a short time and in that short i was very unhappy. the coworkers there was rude and nasty to each other and even to some custmers. i did not like how they kept there area. they would work off and do other things instead of doing there job.
good,Dedicated workers who take pride in the work and interacting with guest giving great guest service.
good,"Since this was a seasonal job I thought it would be a great experience. However I was proven wrong, very high demand with no recognition. I would work back at Target only if I didn't have a choice."
good,"The HR dept. know how to recognize talent, but for the store management you work with were very unprofessional. HR did speak of the area that I assumed I would get located to, unfortunately didn't happen."
good,In 2000 this was a great part time job. They were flexible to my availability and I felt valued and respected up until two years ago when Target went in a new direction with modernization that did not include my part time schedule. The caring for team members culture ceased to exist. Scheduled hours plummeted for all team members and expectations were greater than humanly possible. Many long term dedicated team member were forced out by this new way of of doing business
good,"While working at Target it became clear that the managers of all levels had their favorites and were biased no matter how hard you worked, you just couldn't win. I'm not saying Target is not a good place to work. But the Fort Union location is not a good one. Steer clear."
good,"At the Tomball north location most of the leads are rude, and have a dumb amount of tasks that you are expected to finish with no time. the only time of year that you actually get hours if you aren't a main department are the holidays, and it lasts about a month. after that everyone struggles to get hours. i was getting around 4-8 hours a week when it wasn't holidays. the only people they give hours to are full time workers, specifically being a lead or in electronics. they also do not give overtime hours; they will just make u leave early if you are approaching 40 hours."
good,"Management only looks out for themselves and the promise everyone hours, then turns around and cuts them and hires new people. Not a good place to work at right now."
good,I was paid for a temporary/short term of employment. I earned the money that I received. Good products available. Odd undercurrent at the location I worked.
good,If all you are looking for is a good paying job with minimal hours it’s a good place to work. Recently moved in the direction of not trying to progress any of they’re employees.
good,My managers discouraged teamwork and expected you to solve every problem on your own without asking questions. They would deny any time off and was not flexible with my school scheduling.
good,"You'll always be busy doing something, never a dull moment. Working there improved my skills working in a fast paced environment and coworkers are friendly. The hardest part of this job was their hours. You never had a set schedule and hours weren't so good either, fight for your hours!!!!"
good,I worked as a part time seasonal employee and received poor training. I understand most jobs are like that but one particular manager talks down to new employees that are still learning and call them out in front of everyone. It’s very unprofessional. This manager says things like “use your brain” as constructive criticism. There is an overall lack of direction and instruction. The jobs is not very demanding but they expect you to be productive.
good,"Target eliminated my position with no notice and i began bouncing around from work center to work center, i was not utilized properly and my managers were incredibly toxic"
good,"I do not feel comfortable leaving a review when I don't know where it will end up, who will read it, how it will be presented,  what the context is, or if my name will be anywhere on it"
good,As a Cashier/ Service Desk / Cafe' worker it was a good place to work. Each day was a different and things was always changing. I enjoyed working in a fast paced place.
good,If you like Walmart Target is just a little better if you don't like Walmart don't bother to apply here same stuff just nicer about it. little to no hours
good,"Gm paid well, were very supportive during my father's death. However as upper mgt changed so did everything, no one ran things like before Too many chiefs not enough Indians."
good,"This job requires you to work full time in the Texas area in order to at least pay your bills provided they don't exceed $1200.  I was unable to pay my bills and was evicted which forced me to quit my job and relocate. Also my manager at the time was really terrible to me and made my life terrible for absolutely no reason. I came to work, did my job and went home. When I couldn't take more hours she treated me like garbage and took my hours away. I won't work for Target in Texas again."
good,With the new companies policies it's a very strict work environment. Used to be a great place to work. But with higher pay = higher demand. It's not impossible to do the work load and you get yelled at for not being able to complete it.
good,"They really didn’t work with you when you need them to work with you, they tell you they do but they don’t. Not very flexible enough to to be working there at all."
good,Most of the management only got to there positions but kissing each others behinds. The head manager yells and cusses at you if you make a mistake. They expect you to take the job as serious as them but they get paid way more then you and receive additional benfits that normal workers there do not. They blame you and your team for mistakes they could have prevented with more care as manager . mnager
good,"upper management seemed to try to sabotage each other, which that culture trickled down to the associates. unless you were a kiss butt, and/or had a college degree (even if it had absolutely nothing to do with your job) that's how you were able to advance. not because you were good at the job and had experience."
good,"Target was a great place to work at when I first started. The management was wonderful and always made you feel like family. Within the past year, they have many, many changes. These changes have made working there extremely stressful and not fun. There is a completely new staff, and they do not care about your home life one bit. Everyday, I feel bullied, as if they want me to quit."
good,After the first five years company became more focused on market share than taking care of their tram members. I only stayed because of the time I had invested.
good,"Worst thing about retail isn't the guest like some people think, they're actually the best part of it. However, Target's management is so poor it makes coming into work horrible. To be working with a guest and see my manager looking in on me like a hawk is really ridiculous, especially since I get guest compliments almost daily."
good,"Working here wasn’t that bad, the discount is complete BS tbh it’s only 10perecent and then on food it’s 20% but if you don’t have a super target close the discount sucks. I loved being at work because target is different but the people who where above me had a problem with every little thing"
good,"ETLs and other LEADS do not like to accept constructive criticism nor do they allow you to express concerns about tasks that should be performed daily by each expert in their department"
good,"Honestly if your young and never had a job this job is made for you but if your married have kids and a life then I wouldn't recommend. I worked there a short time and didn't like it. I would extended my shifts practically everyday when they asked and come in to cover shifts, just  to avoid getting called in on my day off but nope they literally called me on everyday off I had and if I didn't answer they would keep calling. Its pretty sad how much they take advantage of with new employees especially when your on the floor by yourself they leads intend to throw so many tasks at you to get done in a 4 to 8 hrs shift its pretty impossible for one person to get done and at times I thought maybe it was things they needed to do but didnt want to do it."
good,"Really fun job, but didn't pay much at all.  There were little to no benefits unless you were a salaried employee who works more than 60 hours a week.  Not a fair company to work for."
good,Little experience needed for decent pay. Unrealistic expectations per workload. Strong team element. Inconsistent hours. Learned a lot about customer service and guest interaction.
good,Costumer service is best but not full hours  . Always fight for hours . And management is not good supervisors stay in their rooms and make team members do third work and take all the credits for work.
good,It’s to much work and they make you u load the trailer by your self and I work  recommend if you have another job but it was too much for me I did put so much work into it
good,"Because I was the only one physically capable, I was often required to get the carts from outside. Also, the ladies didn't like cleaning the restrooms or bringing in the trash so I had to do that as well. Since I had good customer service I was moved to the service desk from cashiering but I still had to do all the heavy lifting/dirty work. The store is mostly women, which did not mind, but another guy or two to help with the tougher tasks would have been nice."
good,Not horrible not grand. It depends on the day. Biggest issue was the lack of hours and the new front end lead that took over halfway through my time there. She was always nitpicking workers flaws.
good,target is a basic retail job that consists of listening to your elder in the area and helping them with anything besides being stuck doing some remedial task you lose time on.  its was a job
good,Management tend to take their frustrations out on employees below them and tend to dodge their responsibilities. When confronted with an issue they often play the Blame Game.
good,"This is not bad company. However the hours were crazy, as in one week I would work 25 hours the next it was 10. I left because I needed more stable pay to care for my growing family."
good,"This job is a better fit for teenagers rather than working adults. The pay was decent. However, Target provides no benefits. The hours vary per week depending on how busy the store is."
good,"Management is terrible, they want you to work in every other department but your own. They don’t know how to treat their employees or talk to them. The new system they have is awful and most of the employees I’ve started with have quit"
good,"Team leaders have no idea how you lead their teams effectively for maximum productivity. Team leaders walk around giving nasty attitudes to the employees. They like to condone you in front of guests."
good,I work at the target in west Sacramento And management sucks. Pay is not great and their “raises” are jokes. Been there for a year and got a 8cent raise a month before minimum wage went to $13 so now I just get paid $13 not even the extra 8cents from my “raise”.
good,"I learned the bare minimum of what I needed to know to cashier. Other than that, my managers were always upset and annoyed and I didn't feel like I was in a safe environment."
good,Advancement is based solely on who you get along with. There are no programs or trainings in place to acknowledge or recognize accomplishments amongst the lowest level employees.
good,they suck and the whole business need to goooo ! They are inconsiderate to family matters as in if your child is hospitalized and you have to answer doctor calls .
good,after changing the management target become the worst it used to be really really a fun place but not anymore. team leaders don't approach to their team members in a respective way
good,"You must have open availability, but you wont get many hours. When there are payroll hours, they will work you hard. Being a hard worker gets you nothing but more hard work. When payroll hours are low, there is no wiggle room. So even when you help them in the busy times, they wont help you when you are struggling to pay your bills. They don't care about you, they care about their bonuses. They are increasing minimum wage, but that only means you will get less hours."
good,The bosses had favorites and forced their least favorites to do everything even their own work. They also took hours from you so they could get a better end of year bonus. Worst place I've ever worked at.
good,"Overall good experience for fresh out of college. "
good,"So many people say working retail is very easy and requires no skills. These are people that have not recently worked in retail. You work hard and fast with minimum staffing, performing diverse tasks with little training. Some managers acknowledge hard work, but most treat employees as completely expendable.The best thing I took away from the experience is some great, hard working friends. They made it possible to laugh now and then."
good,"managers were very much in a clique and would talk down to employees like children. if anyone was caught laughing or having fun, they would move you to a new location by yourself."
good,"Team members who kiss the managers butts are who get 35+ hours, even when you do everything right and work harder than most, if you don't kiss their butt and disagree with them they'll punish you by giving you less than 20 hours."
good,I did not have the best experience while working at target. It sucks because I've heard such great things about other targets but the one I worked at was a joke. Management sucked. They didnt really care about any of the regular employees just focused on the team leads. Did not like working with snooty team leads. It was high stress when you were timed on getting online orders picked and out to customers.
good,It's a great place to work if you are young or only need a part time job. There is no longer a team culture even though you are called a team member. Hours fluctuate constantly. One is not able to make a living wage even though the hourly pay rate is pretty good.
good,Fantastic workplace culture and company vision. Management hours minimum 50 per week with little to no weekends off. Retail industry means constant interaction with customers.
good,Assigned to stocking and presenting one of multiple departments. Low pay and supervisors rarely recognize employees going above and beyond. Good first job.
good,Over-all my experience at Target wasnt that bad. There was a lot of turn over with pharmacy managers. Our core team of techs and pharmacists was amazing. The customers on the west side were usually very difficult to deal with. The DEA was at our location quite a bit and there were a lot of arrests due to violence towards staff and fake prescriptions.
good,"No one in charge has a clue, fresh out of college. You have to work crazy schedules and everything is dictated by the stores and holidays.  If you expect to have Thanksgiving off, don't work here."
good,"was a good first job but management kept getting worse and worse. will get on your case for not reaching a redcard minimun signup, even though you dont work register."
good,they give everyone a raise once a year regardless of skill or time put in so by the time minimum wage raises your getting paid the same as a day one employee they treat you like disposable garbage
good,The Store Manager and the Executive mangers are horrible. The offer little to no help and delegate from their desk. They give unrealistic timelines in order to get “more out of the team”. I have literally left in tears because of how frustrating and unrealistic target has become.
good,"Very changed company through the years. If change on a daily basis is a struggle, this is not the employer for you. They do attempt to try and keep the workplace fun with keeping food/snacks in the break room."
good,"The company as a whole might be OK but the pay isn't great and the structure of everything wasn't appealing. "
good,Pays pretty good but doesn’t give enough hours to the employees to be able to live off of. So people always quit from there. People that are full time more than likely won’t get full time hours at certain times of the year (most of the year).
good,work place had a great staff however management liked to abuse power and pay. Liked to belittle workers and use them to their benefit and require beyond what can be done and with a bad attitude towards employees.
good,"Target is a good job only if you are looking for a temporary job , the work experience is throw at you immediately so you need to adapt quick if you don’t they will use that as a excuse to let you go"
good,My first job. I didnt really have anything to compare it to but after a couple of years i started to really see management change and hours being allocated to other departments. Unfortunately team morale fell once most of our management was replaced and then it just kinda got worse from there.
good,"- Poor Management from higher ups, constantly getting pushed to work faster unreasonably than what we were paid. Employees had no leeway and would be urged to a deadline on poor pay for the worker and constant harassment if not working at sufficient pace. "
good,"Target was great when it was good but when it was bad it was really bad, now Im only talking about the Springfield Va location."
good,A lot of teenage workers who did nothing but socialize with friends and were able to leave early without completing tasks because they were in school.
good,I would work around 10 hours a week. I was off every other week. They really did not want to use the knowledge I could offer them. I always had to little hours to run the business.
good,Management would rather bring in other employees to fill a position rather than using the qualified employees they already have. Most of the higher management are not properly trained in ALL departments.
good,"Working at Target would of been great if they took care of their long time employees but they dont, no matter how long you work there you will never be a full time employee unless you become a team leader"
good,"usual stock and clean, organize and be productive. management needed improvement.  the hardest part was the impossible time limits set with the lack of manpower involved for replenishment tasks."
good,"Target must do better as a company. They should have more leniancy for people without child care. The amount of work load they give H.R team members, they should be paid the same hourly rate as sales floor team members.  There needs to be more room for growth in the company and way more professionalism coming from Team leads and Lod's and ETL's."
good,I worked at target in a seasonal position. It was a fast paced job. They pay well and can be flexible with your hours. Over all I enjoyed my job at target.
good,"Started working for Target in 1990 and the company was so different then it is now.  Now certain stores do not care about their employees  and go as far as to lie to their face.  "
good,"Typical retail, if more stressful and catty than most. It was a temp holiday position so I didn't expect much. Wasn't kept on despite working hard and making it known I wanted to stay."
good,"A day in the life would mean coming in and reporting to your manager about what they would like for you to do, then having another team lead tell you that you are wasting your time doing that function and for you to report elsewhere. "
good,You go in and get your handheld and start picking items and items you cant find management wont even try to help you. and you have have too many cant find items in your pick. you also have to pack all the items with in a certain time frame.
good,Not much room to grow with favoritism. not a fair promotion Pool. pretty much a oh i like you be a manager thing. not based on skills or if the person was capable of leading a team.
good,"work and retail experience; at times, a fun place to work; extremely productive; and employee discounts (hourly salary wages have increased since my 2011-employment where my salary was $8.50 per hour as a cashier)."
good,"Hired as a seasonal worker but kept on after the holidays. I learned a lot about retail, and management styles which I hoped would help me in my future. My manager knew my education goals and objectives but I was never given an opportunity to advance. Black Fridays were the worst, and I needed to get out of retail for that reason. I missed out on a lot of family obligations due to need to work nights and weekends. Not a lot of flexibility there."
good,They dont care about u. Your are just another number. But the pay is good. I stayed there for seven years and felt not valued as an employee. So my advice stay away
good,"Management is not very good or well-rounded, scheduling is iffy, I was written up for a management mistake with my schedule. I have learned how to hang clothes properly. The hardest part of the job is cleaning up after people."
good,"For me this job was great at the time until I had to move. My only issue with Target is that they have this stupid requirement for the managers to have college degrees. Honestly who goes to college to manage Target and make a little more than minimum wage? No offence but this is bogus, they would anielate Publix and other competitors if they cared more about their employees and they're advancement. Honestly, from working there a short time, I'm surprised they haven't fallen in the ranks sitting next to Walmart. They are basically the same now. So if this review gets to corporate, CHANGE WHAT ISN'T WORKING! You pay people too low for keep the whole store up to par, and trust me, I have not seen a manager do anything but boss people around and I cannot stand that. Work people up the ranks and you'll see an improvement."
good,better accommodation is needed for employees. don't hire people for part time and give them full time hours. Reston is  a very expensive place to live.
good,"It’s busy in the food area and many Guest come in and out so when we got work loads most times we can finish. Some days were unable to finish them because were too busy helping the guest or the LOD has another project for us after that load. I learned that targets thing is “You own your own growth” I been trying to grow for the past 3 months and I haven’t gotten trained on anything, my leader said she feels personally I’m not fit so I’m not sure if that’s a great thing. Management is okay... some are nice and they’ll help you out others they come at you but they don’t know they coming rough on you. Enjoyable part of the job is meeting new faces everyday and also even seeing our regular peeps that come in also working with an amazing team members that make my shift awesome."
good,"Basically all you do for a 8 hour shift is put things on shelves, it’s extremly boring with little to no contact with people unless they need you to rush over to the register for fast service. The pay is ok but the job itself is so dull and not fulfilling."
good,"Typically I arrived at 6-7am and worked until 3:30pm, which is a very full shift. Overall the work is repetitive and difficult at first to get quickly but after about a month you get used to it, but whenever I believed myself to be doing a good job a supervisor would pull me aside and claim I was too slow and needed to ""get my act together"".  I felt underappreciated and worthless working under the management that I did and in the end felt that they paid me the wages they did to make up for the horrible way you are treated. I was always under the threat of someone coming in and replacing me, of being fired when I walk through the doors, and it was a very stressful environment to work in. I learned how to extend my limits which is great, but in the end wasn't good enough for Target and that is what caused me to leave."
good,Target was a good job starting but it’s not room for moving up unless you have degrees behind your name. Target expects you to guess when they have bigger titles available. You only find out when they announce the person for the position
good,"Bad hours and work environment.  The schedules were never steady, nor were the hours. Forced to work on holidays such as Christmas and Thanksgiving. Very little vacation given"
good,Target is a good company to work with however the management doesn't communicate well. The job isn't hard and I enjoy working with people. The company has taught me values of paying attention to details and being accurate in counting money.
good,"I worked for Target for many years.  A lot of Teamwork in the beginning, but that has disappeared with the management that is in place in the stores now.  They have an ""everything is wonderful at Target"" attitude and God help you if you say you don't agree with them.  They hire twenty-somethings to run a store and the team members know more about how things run than management.  I brought up a problem situation to a manager and was asked ""What do we do?""  Let's just say, if it isn't on their cell phone, they can't help you."
good,Do not plan on making a career here.  Advancing is next to impossible and they are not willing to work with your schedule to allow for you to go to school.
good,Target was a great place to work as my first job because it helped me gain many important work skills. The work is very repetitive but the people were nice to work with. The management was poor but The schedules and hours were flexible.
good,"Managers and supervisors are very unprofessional. Not only are the rude and disconcerting to their employees but they are also the exact same way with guests, especially the ones who have. Complaint to make about one of the main workers in charge."
good,"The new LOD at the Kokomo Target has ruined that place. The Target team prior was fun, worth working, and the manager was always willing to cross train you. The new manager will lie to future employers about you, makes inappropriate jokes, is rude to employees he doesn’t like, and so much more. Almost everyone that worked there under the previous LOD have now left because it became miserable to work there. Skylar does not have your best interests in mind at anytime, he doesn’t care about his employees at all. Very unprofessional."
good,"It's a great first job, but not somewhere where you would want to stay. They view people as replaceable. The people were great to work with, but Management doesn't value you. Management expects more than what is humanly possible."
good,that they let too many people get away with murder. they over load the employees that actually come in there to work . while if you want to talk you can stand around for most of the day. and they will give you most of the hours
good,"Twelve hour shifts are challenging"
good,"I used to love working for Target, and the company is still gook, but store #2058 in Lady Lake is going downhill fast. New management is disrespectful and uncaring."
good,"Leaders do not talk to each other to ensure everyone is on the same page. Most are on power trips and actually like to watch employees suffer or be stressed out. Often gives out ultimatums or demands without the proper knowledge of company policy. It's a good short term job."
good,"At the beginning, they're always willing to help you out.  After about a week, it becomes a chore for anyone to help you.  Pricing, ringing, etc. always a problem at Target"
good,"Whether it was private or not more than often if you weren't in their circles you didn't advance any where it seemed the more you were hanging with the ""cool kids"" the better chances you get to go higher in the ladder there. In my opinion they lost a lot of good hard working people with better qualifications. But hey that's the way it is now a days. So much for caring for your employees. How about these so called managers huh? Well I'll leave that to you Target Co."
good,"Management wasn’t the best, they tended to tell you how “bad” you were doing and never how “good” you were doing. "
good,Manager does not work with you on hours. No benefits that are useful discount Is useless.  Employees are lazy and not very helpful with other employees .
good,"Target pays very well and is a great place to work, its very organized and structured. I would recommend this job to any young high school/ college student."
good,Target has gone through many changes over the years but they have not provide an environment I would recommend for anyone. The store manager created an openly hostile working environment & fired all senior level leadership.
good,"Target has mostly part-time worker status except for management.  You can only work 40 hours and no more.  This is the sentiment of retail.  Extra hours are given to part time workers for those who are willing to cross train and work in other departments."
good,"Fast, Fun and Friendly but any advanced certification acquired whilst an employee is not recognized. Career progression based on favoritism. Well disciplined"
good,Target was hard to work for. They allowed for managers to slack off but came down hard on employees. It was hard to advance unless your had biases on your side. The hardest part was getting management to work with you to make the job easier. Many of the managers were passive aggressive and did everything to make the job harder.
good,Worked hard and was clean fast paced and never boring.  Training could be a little stronger but otherwise okay.  I liked that I kept moving and it was not boring
good,Worked unloading the trucks and pushing the merchandise to the sales floor before store opening. Very fast paced and lots of heavy lifting. Can be fun with coworkers but mainly focusing on your zone first.
good,"Target might be a business and they might have needs, but they often forget it takes humans to make the company work.  Too many managers don't speak up and there is a clear disconnect with Group Leadership and above from the day-to-day operations in stores.  If you are looking for a job to get by and move on to something else, this is it.  Don't expect a career though.  Target HQ focuses on its shareholders not its employees."
good,"Target is a good place to work if you are working for the target corporation. If you work for starbucks don't expect help nor the willingness for the team leads to rotate you for your breaks. If you are a working as a cashier they listen to your needs because of the need for you to get customers to sign up for the target red card. Apply as a cashier, get red cards, then you have a easy job no stress and support of your managers."
good,"must be willing to assist any customer in the store as you are doing your own duties (does not matter if you do not have the time to help), all online orders had to be gathered and taken to the front within an hour, all product that needs to be replaced must be done every hour regardless of how many people you had for the shift (yes even extremely understaffed), from the first week I had someone trying to get me fired just because I didn't know my way around the store and was not able to find all the online orders in a timely fashion"
good,"Fun Place to work, but not enough communication among leaders."
good,Target is a great company. There are some stores and issues with management and the way they treat people. Managers are not equal when it comes to certain people and when they are challenged above.
good,I've been there for 5 years and with the ever growing pay increase I still make as much as the new hires but they expect me and I'm not the only one to train and lead when you aren't getting the pay of a leader position.
good,"It's very boring, I don't enjoy the work. it is repetitive and mundane. There is very little conversation among coworkers. Any customer service jobs are gr"
good,Fast pace with bad hours and very few benefits. Discounts on products are not adequate. The hours are overnight and that schedule completely throws off your day.
good,"No career advancement opportunities, deceptive management, unfair hours. Witnessed harassment of an employee directly breaking company policy and nothing was done about it once brought to STL attention."
good,Positions pay well but benefits are poor and environment are toxic.  Growth is non-existent with no programs that seek to develop talent from within..
good,Management is terrible. Team members and team leads alike inconsistent work ethic. Job itself is easy but the team members here are toxic. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of resolving guests' needs.
good,It's always busy. some training but not too much. schedules are sorta flexible. Clothing dept is the hardest place in the store to keep up with. Flow is great tho.
good,"Target plays a sort of favoritism when it comes to employees. Even if you've worked there for years, there's no guarantee that you'll be moving up the ranks anytime soon. Even if you work all the hours with no complaints, they'll give you the blind eye, even if you ask for a transfer, they'll fire you."
good,"They don't give enough hours a week, they don't allow an opportunity to advance if you're not apart of the click, they don't appreciate your hard work and sacrifices you make for the store. There is no employee appreciation. They will talk to you degrading if you let them. I could say a lot more but you get the picture."
good,"Unless it was a holiday season, the work days were pretty slow. The environment created by the other associates and managers wasn't very friendly. The only other thing cashiers are able to do is pick up around their section."
good,Pay is terrible.  Management changes often.  My first few managers were great while the last one was by far the worst.  They really only care about having a body fill a positions.  Doesn't matter if the person knows how to do that specific job.  They basically do not give training hours for new team members.  If someone doesn't perform on the salesfloor they stick them on the register instead of removing that person from the company.  They stick the issue on to another department that probably would not have hired them from the beginning.
good,"Target is going through different changes in how they do things. They made the work place very stressful. They do not give the folks that want to work 40 hours, even if you never call in to work. I could not support my family on 30 hour weeks. I was tired of working two jobs to make it through the month."
good,"Terrible weekly hours. I've worked weeks where I was on the schedule for 2 days, and those days were half days. I'm unable to take care of my personal living expenses under these conditions."
good,its a good first job for experience while going to school  or seeking a better opportunity. some management there are a bit to unrealistic on how certain tasks should be done.
good,"I was assigned to the soft lines which included all clothing, shoe, baby and dressing rooms. Periodically I was called to the front registers to assist checking-out customers.  "
good,I really liked working with my coworkers and supervisor basically did my own thing but it isn't enough to pay the bills nor enough hours. Job is pretty straight forward all the supervisors are very helpful.
good,it wasnt long enough hours for me the associates where nice and we all worked together good. management stays on you dont really give alot of time to learn they expect for you to know what your doing.
good,"The company was great to work for, the pay was also great. They didn't want to work with me on my college schedule. They had me working from 2am to 7am when i had college from 8am to 9pm."
good,"I worked there almost 10 years ago now. And I can tell you it wasn't a surprise to me when they went out of business a couple years ago. They had poor management, and didn't know the real value of their outdated electronics."
good,All the managers form clicks like in high school and plays favorites. Was fun in the past but went down hill when they started hiring managers with little experience.
good,"Work in department stores, you have enjoyable work time.Time goes very fast. Time schedule are little awkward, but it is ok. Most fun full day pass there."
good,Target is a good place to start of your work venture. During my time employed at target I learned valuable things about the work place and also about life. One of those was to accept that everyone comes from a different place and perceives things in a different manner. Diversity is a huge part of our country.
good,"The company is good to work for, other than the unattainable benefits (health, dental, etc). The hours fluctuate weekly, but typically maintain enough hours to make good pay checks."
good,I have not work for target very long but I have worked retail for 10+ years. The pay and hours are minimal. The management are rude and treat you like scum of the earth.
good,"As a night worker and with the new changes happening to the target company, say bye to your job. As bad as daytime is, that's where the hours are at as the whole company is moving in that direction."
good,"- management plays favourites and is bias towards the team members"
good,"Frequent shift in managers"
good,"If you like a hot environment to work on and little hours, this is for you. I don't. I need more hours. They have a revolving door for certain positions. They don't take care of the loyal workers."
good,i start my day off  with unloading two trucks and finish with packing shelves with products and backstock the remainig products. with that i learned how to use a pda. management makes it hard to get the job done. the hards part of the job is off loading the truck and the most enjoyable part of the job is packing the shelves.
good,I personally did not have a nice experience working for Target. I did not enjoy the work environment and I felt that the work was distributed unfairly and could have been delegated in a better way.
good,If I had a different position it may have been a different experience but since I work in logistic. Once the holidays was over we barely work in hours which made for a poor paycheck. The work environment was okay.
good,"The only complaint I had was the hours. They were not good, but the crew were very nice and positive. They even took the time to help me through a family emergency."
good,Fair pay and hours. Management is not that great. Benefits are descent and team members encouraged to be ambitious within the company. It is a descent job.
good,Target was a good starter job for making some money. The store was bad a guest service and didn't care at all of price or product as long as there was a sale made.
good,"It's not a place for a career. It's a great job for kids in high school, and or retired military officers. Not a bad place to work, but not great either."
good,Higher up management is lackluster at best. Worker are friendly but you can feel a negative energy. Management never promotes within store especially males.
good,A day at work was either really slow or really busy. I started right when they just built this new target. Holidays were very nicely organized. managers were not very communicative for me. I was looking for opportunity and to be cross trained. I spent 2 years years there and it was a pleasant experience.
good,"Long Hours and loads of paperwork that seemed useless. Not an inclusive culture for the pharmacy. Expectations frequently changed, so goals were difficult to achieve."
good,Target is a great place to shop but not necessarily to work. You're always being hounded by supervisors to get red cards from customers & if you don't meet your goal you're pressured into doing so the customers get annoyed of it & hardly ever want to apply for one
good,I loved my job.. I went far and beyond for them. In the end I was taken advantage of and push out the door. For a younger verison of me they could get to do my work for less money
good,I did not enjoy the people that ran the company at my specific location. My specific work area was inviting but during off hours it was not. The people over me were really rude.
good,"As a logistics team member the day starts out by unloading the truck with varying sizes, proceeding to sort products on a line and then working in various parts of the store organizing and stocking shelves. "
good,Loved what I did but I didn't really like management. They played favorites and they didn't like anyone who had an opinion about them 2 of the managers were best friends so whenever you had a problem with one you couldn't go to the other about the problem
good,"I worked on the sales floor as well as the phone operator and in Guest Services. I was an employee that was called on for various tasks that others either didn't know how to accomplish, or just would not.  Here, I developed many skills including selling, inventory, customer service, and complicated phone systems."
good,"The management team was VERY untrained and inexperienced. All the management above my team leader had no idea to handle people in general,  much less people they were in charge of. Every morning the day and store manager wouldn lazily walk the entire store gossiping, drinking Starbucks, and altogether act in a way they shouldn't have in front of employees and customers."
good,"Although the tasks were straight forward, my expectations for more in-depth training were not met.  Hours were meager- part of the reality that if one does not enter the workplace door with a certain skill set, do not expect hard pressed management to take time to train you to expand your skills.  A lot of talent goes to waste for this very reason and was quite a letdown.  As long as there is a large mass of candidates to put through a revolving door, it does not matter how many employees that business has to utilize for a few hours per week per employee to be assigned.  The hardest part of the job was realizing how little difference it made to management whether my versatility within the store improved or not."
good,"I love target it is a fun place to work."
good,"Working at Target on a regular basis is not bad, the co-workers are fun to b around the management is also fun nice helpful n cheerful and everyone works hard and gets their job done."
good,"management is very poor, half the time you are confused as to what they want you to do. poor communication, and a non friendly environment. i would never recommend this career choice to anybody."
good,"When i clocked in the first task of my job was set up the dining room tables for the retirement residents. After helping them get to their seats, I serve them their required meals and beverages and check on them if they need anything else. Then clean dining room for following day."
good,"Worst thing about this company is that management is full of liars.most of the positive review here is from them or telling the employees to say something positive.they will lie to you, force you to work when time is past.they don't care about you only themselves and they will do everything to get away with it so if you decide to work here keep in mind record and make sure you don't give any original paperwork to them."
good,"I love the people i work with, BUT working for target for 6 years at 3 different target...NOT a smart idea,"
good,The management is bad they don't really properly train the employees. Very well fun people though very chill environment.
good,"Working with a big team is always fun, the not so fun part is the pressure of red cards. But the accomplishments of hitting goal is always rewarding. Typically day is guest service, stray, and red cards."
good,"The area wasn't a safe one with a high school right across the street, high theft was prominent in the department I worked. The staff made it possible to keep the place maintained. "
good,In this job I have learned that you are expected to do more then what you get paid for. Management only looks out for themselves and does not care about their employees
good,"If you have decent management its enjoyable. The customers are such cry babies, and management expects you to kiss butt. The only way to advance is to get lots of Redcards, doesn't matter how good you are at your job...you have to get Redcards.."
good,"working in the front lanes (cashier area); we have to support everyone  in the store. do price checks. Ring customers up, guest services, customer service."
good,"If You Are A Student This Job Could Work For You."
good,"The work days are relatively stressfree and well balanced."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help and assist customers. Making sure their visit to target will encourage them to shop with us on a regular basis.
good,A typical work day for me is opening the my area two days a week. I recently moved to cafe to try something new and i was having issues with the manager over my  logistics team.I started working for my first store doing logistics i did it for four years before i moved stores.My personal hardest part of the job is my shoulder at my first store they ran us into the ground and caused a few problems down the road.My favorite part of the job is the fact that retail is ever changing and you never know that kind of day your going to have every time you walk in. Management at my first store was really horrible but at my recent transfer they recently went threw a management change so things seem to be going pretty good
good,Basically got new mangement and everything chagned about the work place there were no hours for people during the winter months .
good,Target in Middle River has not been my favorite place to work. The store is unorganized and the culture was not promising.
good,"Its really is Dirty in there. All over . they treat employees like they don't even care, You come in there you got to pace back and forth for like a hour before they give you any tasks. To earn anything you got kiss there butt and they will give the whole right cheek to kiss to like its nothing. The management is the worst I have ever been around. Some co-workers are ok, but its like management team only going for the cool and entertaining crowd. Which is like the laziest set of team members ever. They come to work just to hours but don't want to do anything, its really crazy in there. The hardest part which is but being in there with the proper supervisors."
good,"It was a Happy Place to work. The managers and supervisor are very friendly, staff was very happy people."
good,"I serve customers all day looking for specific products that they need along with restocking the shelves from the back room. The management was not all that great because they were a lot of them but never all on the same page. I got a long with most co-workers and we were a very diverse team, but once again there was a lot of drama working with kids right out of high school. The hardest part of this job is that no one never worked fast enough. It seemed like they over worked and underpaid here. But once again working with customers is the best part of the job, like finding that one item and we had to dig for it because it was the last one. The only reason why I took this job was because it offered benefits to part time employees and when the ""target scam"" with credits cards happened around Christmas that year they took away part time benefits and then proceeded to cut everyone's hours almost in half."
good,Always the same routine that gets worse from management always micromanaging. Most of the other team members are good to work with but a few you wonder how they ever got the job or continue to work there.
good,Hardest part of the job was taking care of a busy line with no help most of the time.
good,"Target is a multi-billion corporation which anyone would think can afford to offer benefits. Unfortunately, unless you are a full time employee(team member) you will not qualify for any sort of benefits. Sadly, they only hire part time(figures) and good luck getting max hours. They start at minimum wage with a 10% off TM discount. If you are looking for a steady job with a steady schedule, apply somewhere else. If you are looking for a job with messed up schedules where your are overworked and under appreciated then by all means, maybe that 10% off will compensate for that.  Typical life while working at target is, coming in to work to look at a board with your screwed up schedule for the next 2 to 3 weeks. Say goodbye to your social life. You go in and another board says which area you will work in that day.  Trust me, you will not work in that area until the last 3 or 2 hours of your shift. The whole time you are running back and forth from backroom to the store stocking whatever they could fit into flatbeds. Usually stuff the person before you could'nt get done. Last 2 or 3 hours you are rushing to finish your actual work which most likely you wont finish even if you did your best. No matter what management will never be satisfied unless you finished completely and even if you did dont expect to feel appreciated. Lucky for me I had pharmaceutical school background and moved into the pharmacy as a tech. Totally different environment with store management pretty much just pressuring the lead pharmacist not you. Which takes me to the next thing. Pharmacists in my case were awesome!"
good,Target is retail driven and it makes it hard for medical people to grasp that concept.  Work hours do not have a work life balance.   Target speaks of work life balance but it not seen in every department.  Numbers are important not quality.
good,A typical day includes opening the clinic and getting it ready for the Nurse Practitioner.  Fielding phone calls and conducting drug screens. Answering questions concerning Flu vaccines. Since I am HIPPA certified I also cover the CSR position at the clinic when needed.
good,"My biggest pet peeve with target is you cannot get benefits till you reach 1000 hours. Then when you are interested in getting cross trained in another area they will not advance you. They butter you up and say you will get it. You will never get promoted on hard work. I see people that work themselves to the ground and don't even get recognized for their hard work."
good,"While I enjoyed the time I was employed at Target, the management team was not consistent and did not display respect for the hourly employees."
good,"This was my first job ever, and it taught me how to work with many different people and personality types on a daily basis and how to maintain in a fast paced environment."
good,This was a great company to work for while in college because of the flexibility. Management promoted who they liked not who deserved it. If you closed you worked long hours.
good,Constantly on the go. Able to meet different people from different walks of life.
good,"TYPICAL DAY: Help customers and keep area neat and clean."
good,I loved working at Target because of the people. It is really hard to get sales at times and especially when alot of the people can not afford the product.
good,Working for Target is okay if you just need something part time.  If you plan on making it full time work it will not be enough.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me meeting the satisfaction of all the customers needs, while performing my daily work duties."
good,Overworked for not enough money.  Super busy location with unrealistic daily performance expectations.
good,When I worked for them this was a well organized company. People were great.
good,Not a very good place to work. Expect  way to much from there employees.
good,"its normally a regular day cashiering, its the same thing everyday all day, same stuff but different day, does not pay well enough to support my family"
good,"My typical day at work consist of doing push which means pushing out items to restock the shelves, I do zones which is picking up a department, folding clothes, hanging them up in the right place, and also cashier. I learned how to cashier, multi-task, be a team worker, cashier, use a PDA and LPDA, and how to communicate with others. Don't want to get to much into the management their but my personally and other co-workers would agree with me that management their is horrible. They go based off favoritism, likes, and its very political there. They only worry about themselves and don't ever ask us about how we feel about certain things, another thing is that we can't complain or if we have a issue with someone we can't communicate with no one because once we complain it gets to that person and I thought everything was supposed to be personal but there is no such thing as personal."
good,work 8 hours looked in a store all night you have to work at a fast pace all night
good,"A typical day is stress full as they tend bite off more then they chew..More often then not."
good,did not like it to much managers semed to think they were better than anyone ekse
good,typical work day was working on the women department cleaning and folding of the merchandise . And ask to help on the cash register if it was getting busy over there. The staff was very caring people.
good,"run around like a headless chicken till about dinner time delivering and then chill until the collections are ready"
good,"I liked working at target at first. It was a nice place to work and learn. I advanced from temporary cashier to barista in starbucks in about 2 months. It was fine until I had to attend a funeral and they told me that my job was more important than attending, in which time, I resigned."
good,"Amarillo,Tx-first starting at target it was great,. i loved it always wanted to be at work"
good,"Working at target I have learned that there are all types of crimes to be committed and criminals to detain sum of the craziest encounters happen on a day to day basis. Some of the management is very nice and good to get along with because they care not only for the store but for their employees also, and sum just act as if its another job no care or concern.Co-workers for the most part are respectful sometimes quiet but easy to get along with. The hardest par of my job is being able to maintain an entire store when your the only tps officer on duty.And the most enjoyable part is going home everyday in one peace, safe and sound thanking god that your able to do it all over again."
good,Target has a good 401 plan which matches dollar for dollar. I also learned to worked well with other people of different back grounds.
good,My job is a challenging job. There is always something to do.
good,"Clock in, Clock out. Work under strict management. Uniformed, conforming to the work. Good for first job. Hardest part was the tedious and repetitive work with no thought. Most enjoyable part was working with a variety of co-workers. Management is not bad, but not top of the line who only care about themselves and not the quality for the workers. I learned the difference between good and bad management, and team work."
good,"Most of the people I work with are good people. The work is fast paced due to unloading trucks. Early hours, and over nights during Christmas season."
good,"Target is a place that most people shop at for groceries, clothing, and other necessities. I learned how to use the register first; performing debit, credit, check, cash, and tax exempt orders. I learned how to replace receipt tape and coupon paper/ink. I kept the area tidy and free of clutter. I learned about Target Red Cards (credit and debit) and the benefits of both. I used those benefits as incentive for the guest's to sign up for the cards. I pulled items forward on shelves and in the drink coolers at night. All of the co-workers were extremely kind and mostly pleasant to work with. There were a few managers that seemed to have bad moods on certain days. The hardest part of the job was fulfilling the quota of red card applicants each week. I enjoyed the face to face interaction with each guest each and every day. I love pleasing people and making their experience something they wont forget by going out of the way to make sure they get through my line quickly and with no mistakes."
good,"Enjoyed my cashier, customer service positions while at this company..."
good,the hardest part of the the job was having a customer yelling at you because you could not refund their money.
good,A typical day in Baxter started with a lecture on what was expected each day
good,"Really busy and crowded place to work, lots of multitasking involved, I didn’t really like the job mostly because of the rude and disrespectful customers, but I'd put a smile on and do my job(cashier)."
good,"Target is one of the largest companies in the world. Working there was an interesting experience. The management team were inexperienced and unprofessional, and could have been more diverse."
good,If you can handle working with customers this can be an enjoyable job. Management needs work tho.
good,Its starts out good but then they treat you terrible. They treat you like you don't know anything. They say things behind your back.
good,"The typical day at work at Target involves interaction with many customers (they're actually referred to as guests), assisting them with their purchases, and opening new credit and debit accounts. The one thing that I learned in the three years that I have worked here is that you have to raise the bar for yourself, and learn from watching others, and asking in the hopes that someone will answer. There are managers that are willing to help, but most do not have the authority to move you forward in the industry. Management that DO have the authority don't seem to show the interest nor inspire encouragement in order to promote from within. There is very little compassion and understanding from certain management in regards to vacation and time off. The coworkers here are a good group, but like me, they get discouraged after expending so much time and effort for very little compensation. The hardest part of the job is too much heavy lifting (a moderate amount does not bother me) and not enough guidance from management. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you rank among the top team members (according to statistics) in areas of performance, overall attitude and new account sign ups."
good,"It was okay for the time, unfortunatly all of us were lied to when we started. They gave false promise to hire numerous people, when they actually had no intention of doing so. They used this tactic to make people work to the best of their abiltiy. I can understand why some may need that, but alot of people like myself have strong work ethic, without being tricked to do so."
good,"Working in a fast-paced store helped me learn the odds and ends of team work in a workforce environment. Management was ok, it seem like not alot good communication for the employees.MY co workers were helpful through out my time here and motivated me more and more.Overall my experience here was a great learning process to help me suceed to better opportunities."
good,"typical work day is crazy busy, hardest part of my job is not having the support from management, most enjoyable part of my job is going home"
good,Really didn't care for the employees.
good,Horrible management and Human Resource department. No room for advancement or other opportunities within Target Corporation.
good,Vaules in this company are not right.
good,Ive been working for this company for 4 years and I have'nt been promoted yet.
good,target is ok to work at if you don't support yourself..they only pay min.wage..and there are slow times when we only get 5-10 hrs a week..they need to pay more..
good,"For a first time job, it was alright. The work environment can change from time to time depending on management but If you work hard and keep to what their goals are, it is an okay job."
good,"8 years working there, all of a sudden I'm put in a new position and my hours go from 30 to 4 per week. I had done nothing wrong, have no idea and there's no explanation for it."
good,They like to take credit for your work. They don't respect your availability and like to schedule you for random shifts. There are no career advancements. They would much rather hire outside people than to promote employees within. They don't care about employees wellbeing. They tell you not to call in if you're sick but the second you do they give attitude and confront you about it the next day.
good,"The company is to large for your to feel like you have an impact to the company.  The management did not have realistic expectations for the employees "
good,"Our team lead is rude and doesn’t act like  a leader everyone else is fine. Work environment depends on which department you are working, is worth if your not in the front end"
good,I enjoyed my fellow employees very much and I am grateful for the relationships I formed. The business itself will wear out the hard working employees very quickly and job advancement rarely occurs.
good,i really dont want to write anything about this job bc the only thing it is doing for me is keeping me away from student loans and teaching me how to deal with people i dont like
good,"Every day at Target is a new different day."
good,"This place has been a rollercoaster since I’ve started. 70% of the managers are rude and do not genuinely care for their staff. The work is not bad, I believe the management makes it worse for the team members."
good,"Target is a decent company to work for. Pay could be better. Not sure what the wage is now but when I worked there it paid less than Walmart does. Overall flexible, decent management. Hard to advance or cross train and understaffed a lot."
good,"Working at target was a really good experience, it helped me build up customer service and working experience since it was my first job. I had a good time working there."
good,The customers at Target are great. I do enjoy working  as a cashier talking and assisting guest. The other co-workers are pleasant and helpful.  I just wish I could work more hours.
good,Hours are only available around the holidays otherwise expect to work 15-20 hours a week. Management is a joke and benefits are too expensive for the hours you get.
good,"Managers are rude, didn't allow bathroom use. No training, just put me on a register then walked away. Supervisor got annoyed when new employees asked questions"
good,"If you’re lucky and have good management and colleges it is not a bad place to work. Beware if you are full time though, they will work you like crazy and then the pay will not feel worth it. For a part time a few short shifts a week it’s worth the pay."
good,"Company does not promote older individuals (40+) no matter how much experience you have, they prefer to promote younger people who tend to be a bit immature and unprofessional at times"
good,"Company needs to work on their management. People get treated unfairly. So much preference when it comes to trying to work more hours, if you don't have a close relationship with management its hard to get more hours"
good,If your lucky you get a great manager that helps you grow instead of putting you down. But the people you can meet there can change your life for the best.
good,"Target overall was a decent company to work for. I spent 5 years working at 4 different Targets while in school before eventually quitting due to management at the last Target. "
good,"Management shows obvious favoritism, and you get attitude for calling out for legitimate reasons. The pay isn't great, but it's the average wage in CA. It's a very clique-y work environment. If you're ""in"" with your supervisor, you'll get the hours you want. The employee discount doesn't apply unless you use cash or a Target REDCard. Some employees are genuinely friendly, but many are rude and snide."
good,"Hires 16 year old kids, that's is okay but sucks to work with kids that dont do anything or just come to work whenever their friend does . Okay management."
good,"I enjoy my co-workers and my position, but no benefits and not enough hours.  We should be offered medical insurance to help employees out, not just dental or visions.  Target should care more about there employees.  This will make Target more successful.  Love us like we love being there.  I would stay if treated fairly."
good,Was a great place to work. Frequent management changes and lack of communication made the job harder than it should have been. Was great until the starting pay was raised and they changed everyone’s job responsibilities. Every three-four weeks your job would change and no training or communication. Frequently understaffed because no one wants to work on the weekend.
good,"Great Team Members,,lot's of turnover due to stressful conditions. Lack of hours during non-holiday. "
good,It’s not for everyone Must be physical and condition to do the job must be able to stand heat and cold weather doing the seasons  must be able to work 10-12 hours a day
good,The job wasn’t bad when I first started I enjoyed it and wanted to move up in it see how far I could go and learn. Now it’s become a stress place not cause of all the people but cause of some of the higher ups and the management
good,Working at Target was a joy with an easy going management a moderate amount of work on a day to day and a great team to build a wonderful atmosphere. My particular location was in the perfect area providing all needs and wants for the vast community around it.
good,At first my work was rewarding & fun.I liked helping people and co workers alike.The work was interesting & different each day.I learned alot from the work I did
good,"They were not flexible with my class schedule and with my other activities as they said they would be, and using the RED card for an assessment for yearly raises doesn't account for the amount of hardworking an employee does while on the job, there are so many other factors that make someone a good employee."
good,"On a typical day, I start by checking with management to see if anything was added to my daily tasks before I start my day. A typical workday consists of checking payroll and adjusting time clock concerns. I've learned if you treat people with respect everything is negotiable. My experience with management is to help them achieve their goals. I love a good challenge"
good,"As a employee I was fine until the Mt Laurel manager got a stick shoved up you know where. She would often speak to me and other employees with mean attitude. Never enough, never enough. If I wasn’t a male I would’ve slapped her into next week. Her flunky is about the same but he’s young and stupid. I don’t think the Company wants this kind of communication."
good,After working there for so long wished things went differently. I did like it in the being but after that wished left years ago. Management totally changed and it was very disappointing.
good,"At first I loved working there, but then they drastically changed everything and didn’t give us time to adjust. The boss made it seem like if we didn’t do the perfect work we will be fired. And they would give hours to employees who didn’t want them and the once that wanted them didn’t get any."
good,"Management was poor, one of them was never in store and the other one was not a help at all.  At first, they were very friendly but at the end you notice you are just a seasonal employee.  Co-workers were mostly very good people with some exceptions, like in every place."
good,They don’t care about your life outside target & tell you you need to balance it out yourself when they give you no time to even live outside target but I don’t know
good,"Yes, the pay is higher than most places offer, but the downfall is that Target is making employees handle so much more on top of what we already have been doing with less coworkers to help out. I’ve worked at Target for 4 years and I used to be excited to go to work every day and now it’s the one thing I dread the most because every day I’m either getting yelled at by guest, supervisor, or coworkers not doing their jobs.  At Target, we are supposed to be a team and the work atmosphere is nothing of the sort now. Very stressful. Great seasonal job"
good,"Pros"
good,"It’s a fun place to work if you aren’t in the front end. There is a lot of cool team building and work. However, pay is bad, management sucks, and there is zero direction or accountability."
good,I don’t believe the problems I encountered will be for all targets because it was due to the team leaders/ mangers. There also should not be so many task put on a single person.
good,I’ve worked in target for 5 years and at first the bosses gave me the good amount of hours and paided well but once I started working in the kitchen they became disrespectful and toxically  manipulative.
good,When I staters working in target the management team was great. They used to treat us fair every time. When the new management came to the store specially Human Resources he was very rude. I have knee surgery in that time I was in medical leave they hiring a new person I came back to  work that girl was the most rude person in the world depress and didn’t have manners. I communicated to my management they didn’t do bathing that was the first their reason I left the company. They start hiring people that doesn’t work and rude.
good,"People on the work place are very nice and helpful, but it is very under stuff and there is not a lot of help from mangers. They sometimes make you close and then open next day."
good,"It as ok working there but the supervisor and management team had their prefer employees. It was a big difference of schedules, and projects or session assigned."
good,"If you are looking for work life balance then do not work for Target.  As an ETL you will work 10-16 hour days, during holidays 6 days a week.  Target is great for experience but many managers are leaving due to the many changes and expectations they have.  Target changed in the 4 years I was there and is still changing, most managers don't know if they are coming or going."
good,"it is good for a part-timer, like a student, retired person or someone who looking for light income. I like their management, supervisor. They were helpful."
good,"The company is trying to create a “Boutique” feel in the store with limited team members on the sales floor. Some stores look rough because of this. "
good,No communication between staff and/or managers.   One  person says do it this way. Another person says do it this way.  Changed from day to day. No consistency!
good,"Management talked down to you if u were fully aware of how they wronged you and would belittle you for wanting something done about it. Not to mention when we were ""behind"" we were still processing faster than the pace they said we should be working (30 cases to the floor and back stocked per hour. In a 7 hour shift at that pace with 300 cases there should reasonably always be leftover work) we would be belittled and outright insulted at times."
good,Target used to be a great place to work.  As of lately hours are shorter what's expected is triple the amount as before and overall employee moral is very low.
good,"Management doesn't interact well with the workers. They only speak to the workers if there was a visit from corporate. Hours are not stable. Hours are always being cut while more work is constantly being added on. There exception are unrealistic in the short time frame that they set."
good,"As a barista, it was usually one person scheduled per shift with only a 30 minute overlap. Managers didn't pay attention to Starbucks needs. friendly coworkers but a lot for one person to handle"
good,"Was an Exceptional place to work, Has Wonderful Team Members. When Management Turns-Over You don't know what You're gonna Get. Good Place for Young Person entering Adulthood, Recommend that this is a Starting Point not able to sustain an Adult Lifestyle. Currently Lots of Changes and Confusion on the Management side which trickles down to Team Members."
good,Target is a nice place to start working for your first time. I only see Target as a temporary job because of the salary and the amount of hours you make in a week.
good,"It began as a good job, with nice people, decent hours, and reasonable expectations. Over time, corporate changes pushed me away from my department, entirely changed what the job was, and dropped my hours drastically. I required a simple surgery at one point, and needed time off for it, which HR ignored entirely on the multiple occasions I brought it to their attention. They scheduled me to work 5 days after I was in the hospital, and basically demoted me once I returned, refusing to put me back into the department I was a trainer in. I was in the process of trying to work things out with my manager but was told that my problems were either 'all in my head' or out of the management's control."
good,Target is a good company to work for out of school. In high school or college. Or even retired and want to do something. The pay is horrible. The cashiers only get $11 to start off with.
good,Target 🎯 is a great place to work for. But with this company management isn’t experienced. There a lot of room for opportunity in the management field
good,Store policies are clear and most team members but the policies can be adjusted for a guest if the knows one of the managers. After working for a while I still dont feel my managers have my back or other team members. It is hard to get hours everyone is practically begging for hours and especially in the front lanes it's always the same people working 40 hours while everyone else is barely working 20 hours a week. Managment needs a big improvement too many managers do the bare minimum and are of no help to the cashier especially when dealing with demanding guest. There is is very little career advancement unless you are one of the managers favorite. Sales floor and front lanes are a mess because of lack of hours causing chaos in entire store.
good,"My experience with target was a mixed one. I came to work on time, did what was asked of me and more, but was continually placed in positions and jobs not suited to my skills or strengths, and then was reprimanded several times for not fulfilling my expected role."
good,There was a lot of communication issues within management and staff. Promised raises and employment opportunities that never happened. Management gossips about employees in office most of the day while other employees hustle and sweat.to get tasks completed on time.
good,"Even though the are trying to make it a fun experience for guests, they are making their employees uncomfortable by forcing 100% guest interaction, even at self-checkout when guest is on phone or clearly does not want to be talked to and that is why they are using self-checkout. Want employees to go up to guests at self-checkout and force them to enter their phone number to sign up for loyalty program by pressing the banner for circle for the guest and also at the register, want to have every guest in a little box as all the same instead of assessing each guest separately and just giving a smile or eye contact when they are clearly distracted with other issues. Not letting employees be themselves and find own groove to bring the guest joy, but instead is forcing to invade the guests personal space even when not wanted. Also, not giving the guest a choice early in the morning and late in the evening by only having one employee in the front of the store doing self-checkout, drive-up orders, and the guest service desk by themselves in the morning and only the closer and one other employee for self-checkout, closing registers, and guest service and drive-up orders at night."
good,You will be on a 90 day probation period when you start. During this period it is easy for them to fire you without Wright ups. Be on your best behavior and do not talk back or have attitude. Ask as many questions as you can to see what they want out of you and job performance. Time management is important here and you will be fired in these 90 days if they see you not being fast enough.
good,It was an okay place to work. They kind of stress you out with the red cards. I didn’t like that. Management wasn’t that good. Only one I say was good
good,Retail environment. Fast paced and can be very busy during peak holiday season. Can be physically demanding so be prepared. Opportunities for advancement are few
good,"If you’ve never worked for Target it might seem like the best place in earth. It’s super accepting, great atmosphere, and the guest comes first! If you work there you learn that you are easily replaceable and not worth the hours they give out. Often times I find myself being micromanaged by managers that don’t believe in my skill. It’s not just a case of “bad management” either. (I’ve worked at more than one target)  Ever since their “modernization” and “competitive pay raises” they have expected more and more of their employees. Reaching levels of literally impossible on one shift, added with regular payroll cuts scraping hours away from the tiny amount you already had. Not good for careers. Promotions are only for the “favorites.” When a position opens up they already know who will be chosen. Interviews happen immediately with no time for “sell yourself” to HR or Store Director. And often times people chosen for promotion are someone connected personally to management. Or on the flip side it’s someone from the outside who’s never worked for target and you basically have to teach them how to do their job. Not good for morale. Overall it gets 3 stars because the pay IS good for it being entry level retail, hours are fishy but I can usually stay above 25 by groveling and picking up shifts. But management is eh at best and I know several people who have regular panic attacks due to the unnecessary stress caused."
good,"Target was a good option until they raised to $12 minimum and now going to $13 and finally $15 in 2020.The remodeling of the stores not only restructured the storea but also the way things work, now people are given 2 or 3 jobs foe the same hrs and pay and the backups all day are horrible, they dont want to pay for more cashiers.Unless you wanna make money a few months and leave i wouldnt recommend this place to work, you will not see your family or kids and if you do they will give you 1 day a week for you to quit."
good,"Management was very poor, schedule management wasn't up to par and I didn't feel welcomed. I was the only man of color and did not feel comfortable while there."
good,It was a fun place to work at for a couple years but now it has changed so much that it's just miserable. You're expected to do so much but don't get any real benefits out of it. Management doesn't care as long as the job is done. My store manager is amazing but corporate is awful and greedy.
good,"Very fast paced, management doesn't know how to speak or treat their workers properly, too much work and not enough reward in return. Co workers are friendly and make the job enjoyable."
good,It was very difficult to move up unless a person had been in the company for over 6 years and they had some kind of diploma to be able to move relatively up
good,"would run over 100%, while running over 100% management would disappear and then would print numbers that were not accurate. Then you could check the telxon for accurate number."
good,"The managers refuse to work with you about scheduling if you can't come in early as they want you to. I went to HR and I got yelled at about it because I told them that I couldn't work in the mornings because I have to go to school also. So you can't expect any help from HR because they just relay it back to the managers and the managers don't actually care. They also really don't like it if you go to HR instead of ""talking to them"" but it's pointless because they don't actually listen. One of the managers was also ridiculously rude to me the very first day I got there and continue to be so until I left target completely."
good,"A banal retail job, where managers were quickly rotated, had minimal amounts of accountability, and the company obviously didn't particularly care for their employees."
good,"Honestly I had absolutely adored working at Target and truly wouldn't mind going back. But honestly the location I was at was a nightmare, the management was all over the place with protocols and rulings over certain things. I was very confusing to hear one thing from one person but get reprimanded by someone else."
good,"Can be a fun place to work BUT beware of gossip and if you fall outside the main clique be prepared to be the center of the gossip."
good,"Managers do not care as much for team members anymore, hours are tight due to multiple changes in the company, very unorganized company at this point because they can't make up their minds on what they want their employees to do."
good,"Target was my first job , I was able to buy my car and move out, I had enough hours and the pay wasn't  terrible. However as time went on it became very clear that the only way you were able to move up in the store was by sucking up. In no way was your blood, sweat, and tears rewarded  by promotions. Our annual ""raises"" were at most a few cents more. The store I worked at in particular bragged about making an extra 5 % in sales. That's an extra 4 million dollars on top of what our store made. In no way did any of that get kicked back to the employees. "
good,"I worked in the clothing department. There was way too much expected of us and nothing expected from other departments. We were required to put out our daily truck load of merchandise, adjust all of the pricing to mark clearance, clean our zone, and re-merchandise all within at most eight hours. The morning shift has too much to do to finish their tasks which then causes the night shift  to not finish and leave more for the next day, it is a constant cycle."
good,"I should start off with the fact that I've worked for this company for five years and had been very happy for a majority of that time. I've had several chances to prove that I was a leader, have been promoted to an assistant for two different departments and thoroughly enjoyed my job. However, for about a year now target has gone through a modernization of their company which has improved their image and brought in several happy customers ( or guests as what we call them ) which is great for the company. However, behind the scenes, we have unethical managers who will purposely ""forget"" about breaks, bully people they don't like into quitting, I've seen one Team Lead tell one of the team members who has a disability that their disabilities didn't keep them from firing that person, give us too much work and expect it to get done in impossible timelines and destroyed any type of moral that has been left on the team.They have no hesitation when it comes lying to employees to get their way about promotions, promises of rewards, and more only to forget about you when you've helped them reach their goals. They have also attempted to discontinue community out reach programs such as donating to the local community kitchen and partnering with local businesses for volunteer oppertunties, which is one thing that many of us, myself included, enjoyed and looked forward to doing. We saw it as a way to give back to the community. "
good,"It was an unfair place to work. I was working at the harlem location and i traveled from Bridgeport,ct to harlem everyday and unsuccessful at giving me a transfer So they fired me instead."
good,Working here sucks no one listens to you and they promise you hours but you never get them. The LODS will doc your hours if they want to. So let's say you get a call to cover a shift but you can't do it they will doc your hours for weeks just because you couldn't cover that shift.
good,"If you're looking for a job they are always hiring, but don't get comfortable there. The company is always changing and management is horrible. You can't advance unless you willing to kiss someone's behind to do it. I know two people who have been working for Target since it first opened at this area in Houston, but they never advanced. And, they're getting paid the same amount as a new employee."
good,"Started as a seasonal worker , was asked to stay on . Moved to self checkout. Then promoted to front in manager with no raise More work. Turn over high."
good,"Working at Target was ok. I worked early mornings, so I was in at 6 and out by 2. Pay was ok. Job wasn't so great. I had three different management members checking on my job, store manager, assistant store manager and team leader. I did my job the best, I was awarded employee of the month several times, I received bonuses and was told I was the best they had in the position I was in. But having three people constantly check on me and questioning me about the same thing, was very stressful. Management needs improvement. Communication between management needs to be fixed. Many people have complained about that."
good,"I always felt like regardless of how hard I worked and what I accomplished, it was never enough. I could go completely above and beyond my role and still be asked why I didn't do even more."
good,Target is a very fast paced and internally competitive company to work for. It's all about how many Redcards you can sell/get people to sign up for. There's not a lot of care for other aspects regarding your performance. It's all about who can sell the most redcards.
good,I was flow team member at target I enjoyed the fast pace work but the management was not the best  also work hours were changing week to week I didnt mind hard work just pay accordingly
good,Target is a great first job for people who are trying to balance school and a job. They are great at working around your school schedule. The hours are not consistent though.
good,"Working at Target was great in the beginning, when I started working during the remodel. It was fast paced , we had 35-39 hours a week. The best part was having a set schedule , you didn’t have split shifts !"
good,"I began my shift in the backroom unloading trucks and inventory all the new products. From there, I would have to unload the pallets of products and transfer them to the shelves, adding prices in the meantime. Though my job was easy to learn and the crew was fun, I was shorted on my pay twice and that is what pushed me away from this company."
good,"We don’t have enough employees, hours are very inconsistent so we have to 2 jobs to sustain. The management are all rude and disrespectful. They have unrealistic expectations for the amount of people they have working."
good,"Good not great, management could have been better. Lack of Drive within the culture of Target, especially towards the advancement of employees and upper management."
good,I've worked at some great Targets and I've worked at some really deplorable ones (I've been at 5 different Targets between Texas and Louisiana). All depends on the culture fostered by the Store Director. My advice: ask a team member how they really feel about the store before applying.
good,"favoritism and going from full time to barely part time  played a big part in my leaving.. they had pizza parties and donuts for good days. working there was ok but not what i was looking for,."
good,Target was great when I first started because they wanted me to stick around for the seasonal time period but they end up just working you to death and they expect your job to be your life and I didn't like that
good,Fast paced with high expectations; frequent changes to expectations and never have a feeling of job security.  High starting wage with fairly low expectations for team members.
good,"A typical day at work involved unloading trucks into the store and then restocking the entire store overnight"
good,When i first started working there i enjoyed the job but now it’s not the best feeling clocking in anymore reminds me of a plantation. I hate the new management now
good,"I really thought this job was going to be awesome. I even moved up quick only because another supervisor got fired. Then they didn't even want to pay me that wage, so I wanted to step down. Why should I get payed the same as everyone else but have more responsibility and repercussions? So they gave me a good raise. Okay cool. Still do not have full time still no paid time for anything but hey okay a raise. A month later they take my raise away, claiming all supervisors in my role did. And use the excuse it was improperly processed..... uh all the other supervisors have been here at least 3 months to years before me. But reviews are coming up so I should be good. Really is this how your saving more money after cutting hours is taking a raise away to give it back when raise reviews come up? OH NO HONEY... its time to go. I am worth so much more than this. I have customers left and right telling me I deserve more...sucks because I love making people happy. New management will tell you a good line and how you should be rewarded. Guess this was my reward."
good,Depending on my role of the day it could be very stressful or very relaxed. Its retail. you cant expect guest to understand its not your fault if something is out of stock or if the price was wrong. Just gotta be able to control emotions and get your job done in  an organized and timely manner.
good,"This was a seasonal job in a warehouse pulling store orders."
good,"Since I am in school, I wanted time off in the evenings to be able to study and do homework, but they found it difficult to accommodate to my schedule, even though they told me they would be able to work around my schedule. The store closes at 11, but most nights you don't get out of the store until 12 or later. I couldn't keep up with school and work, and so I changed my availability, and they cut down my hours tremendously. I don't mind working, I would just prefer not work until midnight, and then have to go home and study for classes, and then wake up at 8 for classes, just to repeat the schedule. The management at Target seems to be a little shakey, being that we have had several managers leave, and have to have new ones come in. Fellow coworkers I have talked to seem unhappy about how things are run there, but the job definitely seems more forgiving to those who can work full time. I don't think it is a terrible company, but it just hasn't worked out for me like I thought it would have."
good,"Target as a whole is a nice place to work, but management is not on the same level. You would have one manager tell one to do things and then another manager tell you something else.  When it comes to the seasonal staff members, they give them the same hours of work and we have been there long before that staff. A typical work day is you are placed at one location and than they would move you another. They do not make all of there staff accountable for work duties. The expectancy is very high being a cashier/guest service and the tolerance of people will make you stay humble and keep all your thoughts to yourself. You can't please everyone and just take in deep breaths and go on with my day."
good,"This company is good to work for if you need extra cash but not reliable when it comes to their word. I was promised full time employment when I was initially hired to find out all seasonal is only scheduled part time hours. Then I was given the hope that if I worked hard, showed up on time and never called out of work unnecessarily I would be considered to become either part/full time. Come to find out they let everyone who is seasonal go weeks before their promised date of release to just post the exact same positions for hire on job boards after I asked to stay on. Overall good money but don't keep your expectations high."
good,"Target managers were very easily distracted & only really cared about themseves. I never got help with things i didnt know how to do, when i asked for help i was told to wait.I was told i had to do certain jobs that werent in my job discription."
good,Working at target was not the best for me. They offered me a position there are did not want to live up to the offer. So I gave them a two week notice and went on my way.
good,Depends on where you work the culture can at times be rough with leaders giving different direction. Some leaders allow using cameras to monitor employees breaks and lunches. Certain stores give incentives during the holidays such as free meals and raffle big gifts such as TVs.
good,"Target offers all the goodies; health insurance, free food and all that. Though I didn't end up getting to sign up for the health insurance, it's there. Raises for anyone starting out are abysmal, going up pennies per year. Though when minimum wage was raised, so was ours by the same amount to compensate, considering grocery already made more than minimum at base."
good,Job was ok for just being a supervisor at a target. Management was not the best and if you are in a higher position you are expected to dedicate a lot to you job.
good,"Management is very poor which makes it hard to work due to the lack of encouragement and leadership. When wondering about policies, often other team leads have no answers which does not help."
good,"It was overall a fairly good job but between the scheduling and management it was easy to get fed up, but all of the people were super cool and easy to get a long with"
good,Was not flexible with hours at all..Management did not care if you were sick you were told you had to come in no matter what. Rude coworkers. A lot of drama.
good,"Stock and replenish merchandise according to store merchandising layouts."
good,"While working at Target I found good days and bad days. Target is a typical retailer and runs its business as one. Management are very straight forward with expectations and will give you some time to adjust if you are a new team member or if your job description changes. But once you have been in your role for some time, expectations are needed to be met. Some managers are helpful and will do what they can to meet that expectation, and other managers aren't so willing to help and expect you to just get your job done and completed. Target also give limited resources and expect you to make do with what resources are given. Its a good job for someone who is looking for a first job or a second job, but would not recommend to make a career out of Target."
good,"Management was changing weekly. Scheduling was not set, making it hard to attend college classes. Was asked to come in work early, only to find myself and others waiting on management to open doors. My crew was asked many times to help another team, when our group had not finished the work assigned to us. Helping other departments was not an issue to me, as long as our work was complete, but that soon became impossible, stressing many employees."
good,"I worked in the market department. (target's grocery section)"
good,my location specifically has wonderful team members. The problem is management. They will make it seem like they care on the outside but they do not care for the workers and you will end up doing extra that you are not paid for including training other team members.
good,"I have 9 years of experience in Customer Service and after working at Target, I'm convinced they do the bare minimum to stay in business. I started working at Target after having moved away from my previous job at Walmart. They honored my current rate of pay and put me into the same position I had before, Electronics Sales Associate. My first week at the store proved to be a waste of time as no one trained me to use any of the equipment. I was able to figure out on my own how to use the registers and handhelds, mostly due to my experience at Walmart using similar devices."
good,Target pays great but demands a lot for it.  Management is hit or miss in terms of competency.  Hardest part is doing your scheduled job while also doing a variety of other work.  Most enjoyable are the coworkers.
good,"Booo if you wan ta life of your own stay away from corporate jobs : they will enslave you & rob you of your time, but at the same time do what you have to do to provide for your family."
good,"Working at Target, your co-workers will end up being your best friends because of how many hours you work. If you are seasonal, they will work you to the absolute most that they can, without having to pay you overtime or full time. They will also try an motivate you by saying that your season will be extended... but in reality, it is a complete lie just to get you to put forward more effort. Target will use you as much as they can, then throw you away without a second thought."
good,"They don't try to keep you around. So if you get on the wrong side of somebody in management, everything you do will be critiqued. They are out to get you to work, work you hard, and they don't care much if you leave. They pay you well and are very organized. They are mediocre about scheduling within your availability. Starbucks was fun."
good,"Target is a great place for people to work while they are in school. They will work with your schedule if you give them enough notice, but getting a good schedule requires you to have been there for awhile. It’s a second job for lots of people."
good,Working at Target is very fast paced and very demanding for the little pay you get.  Getting enough hours is very difficult because they watch hours very closely.  The pay does not meet the required workload.
good,"It’s an ok place to work the management is fair and understanding, I would recommend this work place to my friends/family members I did enjoy my time working here."
good,"At this particular store, managers spent more time in the office goofing off than helping when needed.  For instance, when a guest would ask to speak with a manager, more often than not, we were directed to tell them a manager wasnt available and to deal with the problem ourselves.  I witnessed multiple times where i could actually see the manager on the floor hiding from the guest while radioing me instructions so they could avoid contact with the guest.  Im sure this was just at my particular staore. Hopefully."
good,"Rare to see advancement from within.  Communication not good between the different department managers.  If you want to move up and are a hard worker, look elsewhere."
good,"Hours are flexible but they get mad if you say no to them. a lot of responsibility for barely any pay. work all holidays, barely anytime with family. Flexible hours"
good,I have worked for Target for 23 years and I have really enjoyed it and I really love my job! I really don’t want to leave. I averaged 38 to 39 hours per week. The new CEO that came is making all these new processes of doing things they cut my hours to 14 to 20 and they tell it across the board and nothing they can do about the hours. But yet they have put up signs that they are hiring. I can’t make it on these hours.
good,Poor management with favoritism towards employees who've been there longer. Coworkers would get away with things others would get in trouble for. Very unprofessional environment.
good,"nice work place overbearing management, they push work upon you, very unhelpful if you're having trouble. did have nice co workers and store location was relaxed"
good,"Working at target was really stressful, very unprofessional. Having the skills to communicate and collaborate with your team members is really important."
good,"not much in the way of growth once you're trained in everything and are maxed out in pay, then you're stuck looking elsewhere in order to have any sort of pay increase."
good,no training provided and managers threatens to fire you if you can't make rate but wont train you on how to do the job. Very disorganized and team leads were caught manipulating rate numbers.
good,"Management was unfair and one sided, employees were unappreciated, work environment needs improvement. Not all staff was efficient in their line of work"
good,"-always ""understaffed"" but never enough hours for someone to pay their bills. "
good,Working TPS is not worth it. It is way too much responsibility for the pay. I put my self in danger multiple times to prevent theft of expensive items with no recognition.
good,Management played favorites. Limited area to improve. Stress inducing. Not understanding or sympathy. Can make some friends. Scared or disliked some managers.
good,"Not enough pay for the work needed.  inconsistent schedule, inconsistent management. Very click oriented, had to be liked by management to move forward."
good,"Helping guests, working out pulls, working out reshop. In the nights everyone in the store zones the whole store to make it look nice and all the products are pushed forward on the shelves. It wasn't very good management."
good,"Target is a great place to get your start as a first time employee, although moving up the ladder is nearly impossible from the inside. If you are looking to get some experience in a retail/customer service environment, Target could be a great place to start. If you are looking to advance and make a career in Target, you need to start in a management position to even be considered for advancement most of the time."
good,"They throw you to the wolves when you first begin, so if you aren't a quick learner and perceptive then target isn't the place for you. Got hired on flow team for my husband who was also on flow with ptsd, moved on to become shipping and backroom trainer, and a normal face on the plano team"
good,Manager did not do a good job at understanding the employees concerns. My work days consist of many assignment in several different departments. Fav part of the job was the friendly engagement with customers.
good,All in all my coworkers were the best but management was full of money hungry selfish wolves. I left after they wanted team members to do three times the workload with less than half the staff to do it.
good,"I really enjoyed working at target, but there were also negatives about working there. You work long hard hours and there is a lack of advancement opportunities."
good,"Pay is ok.  Health insurance could be better. Vision insurance has to be used at target optical in Albany are target stores.  Mandatory overtime is required in june and July,  and then for the Christmas season. Can't leave facility for lunch,  but you get paid for taking a lunch break."
good,"Target, at least my Target isn't a great place to work, but it's far from the worst. Many of the managers promise things to get what they want from the workers which cause bad feelings from many. When I oversee the front, I use positive reinforcement to encourage my team to perform and have prizes for those who do exceptional jobs. The way I grew up was to lead by example and most managers fall short of that."
good,Great job. Management wasn’t to great. Management was rude. They didn’t really give new employees a chance to get used to the position provided. Veteran employees approached new employees with insensitivity.
good,Hardest part of the job is dealing with irate guest and the inconsistent management. Only way you will get by is if you been working there for at least 5 years.
good,The job is basically part time. They only provide fulltime employment for a very small few. It's all about how well you get along with management than work performance.
good,I really didint like the store manager he was very rude and not fair. Days were bad when he would cime in talking to adults like they were kids. Also if u came in to help if the store was short with workers no thank u or anything came from the manager
good,"Good for High school job, no career advancements. The job discount is soooooo low for the money they make. They never have company anything, and people are cool."
good,"They have favorites and they only way up is to be a favorite. You can out work the favorite but you still will be overlooked, you can be the best at your job but as soon a one person has a negative opinion about you everybody does. not worth the stress keep it moving"
good,It started out as a fun job that I truly loved. Then it just went down and became a constant struggle to even show up to work anymore. And the customers are extremely rude.
good,Target is a place for those who are interested in the corporate lifestyle and that would like to understand the idea of a business model. However like myself business is not for me being that my interests lie somewhere else. To survive  and advance in a work place like Target they want you to be available when they need you and a quick learner.
good,I do not remember what the typical day of work is like. The manager did not like me because everyone called me by my nickname. Hardest part was getting along with the manager.
good,"The co-workers can be sweet, but you have to remind management practically everyday about needing more hours. Even then they only work you about 8-10 hours a week. As a part-time, I put 40 hours every 2 weeks and I was only getting half that."
good,"I worked in the Starbucks so a typical day was busy and filled with a lot of work. You do all of the prep and ordering for the store. Management depends on who is there, managers change very often. The people you work with can be great. I most enjoyed helping the guests and giving them a great experience."
good,"I worked under target for just under a year. they didn't carry respect for education, and would expect them to be put over school or university. However, I enjoyed being able to interact with many types of people over my year."
good,"Working here was a great first job, but after getting a promotion, things went downhill. Management does not know how to keep track of anything and the hours are super unfair. Good first job but don’t get stuck."
good,Just needed a job to get through college
good,they will just keep changing your job title and moving you to different departments instead of just informing you what they think would be a better job
good,"Target's new direction for customer satisfaction is great for the consumer!"
good,"Alot of this job is getting carts for people. carrying out groceries and other purchases. everyone is in a hurry so the day goes quickly but grumpily. the prework meetings are a joke. most people just do what they want with the daily assignments. Our MOD would disappear to the bar for hours, with the select workers."
good,"I was responsible for checking customers out, who purchased merchandise from target. I cleaned bathrooms, help unload trucks, put back merchandise, that was out of place. I stocked the shelves."
good,"In the two years I worked there my coworkers were constantly changing. The management, while some were nice, mostly treated me like an inconvenience or an idiot, which really didn't encourage a good working attitude. Management liked to throw random tasks at me that I wasn't trained for, and when I refused to do them they acted like I was being completely unreasonable. Some days were good, when the right coworkers were there. There was a lot of pressure to sell Red Cards and it was not a great work environment. I guess things have changed in the last few years since I've been there but I still hear things from my friends that still work there."
good,"You’re expected to work your department, zone, push out merchandise, do go backs, all while helping out the front (who call every 10 minutes, whether it’s grabbing an item for a guest or back up cashiering), covering lunch and breaks, working on projects, and correcting guest price challenges. Frequently short staffed, frequent call offs, sales floor employees have to fill in cart attendant roles because the store only has 2. Entitled guests are the worst also."
good,It was not a bad place but if you have life outside of Target they don't work with you. If you go to school forget studying. You have to be available everyday. If you are not available they will cut your hours and make you work every weekend. I went from 38 hours a week to 15 hours a week.
good,"I have worked here for many years, I think its an overall good job with time. You get used to the stressful environment. That being said, there is many different areas you can work at in Target. So it depends on what you choose. I would recommend choosing a position where you will be able to focus more by yourself. Just focus on your job and don't let others distract you or get to you. There will be many managers coming in and out over time. Some good some bad, Some bad management here and there. It has lots of leniency when it comes to absences or submitting time off, I have never had a problem with that. But you need to work full time to have benefits which I have never had. I work part time. Overall i have never had a problem with the customers but some of the coworkers and managers will give you a really hard time."
good,"I would describe the work place as an awful place to work, management is never helpful and they give poor hours. the best part of working there was the discounts and the pay."
good,"I've been here about 6 months and I loved it in the beginning and was given an opportunity to work in different areas. Because of this I was starting to work more. The more you are there the more you realize how personal the managers are with each other. They show favoritism and take advantage of hard workers. A lot of rules are bent and changed causing a lot of unnecessary problems. A lot of the managers do not know how to treat team members, they can be rude and degrading."
good,"Management was awful, nothing was ever done about employees who didn't do any work or was always late or disrespected the customer. Tons and tons of work gossip very unprofessional."
good,"In any issues involving payment or other work circumstances, you were on your own. it took me 5 months to receive a paycheck that had been stolen. although i had these issues, working there was fast faced and productive."
good,I was told two diffent things by the management about a policy most of them didnt follow. Many of the managers from that time left or were fired because no one was really doing a good job.
good,they manager seems uninterested in what you have to say even with years of experience. Your HR is close to store manager so there is little privacy. Can't trust people
good,"While working as a temp at Target Distribution center in Tifton Ga."
good,"for parttime work I enjoyed my time there. strictly cashier."
good,"Target is a very fun place to work, with plenty of options to change your working routine. The upper management lacks involvement in the employee's performance and is not up to date with their own job roles. The most enjoyable part is having great co-workers and meeting new people everyday."
good,The hours was always crazy. Management was not good. You do get good discount though. I like that i get to meet knew people all the time. It was really fast paste and i loved it
good,Was often not told about new procedures.  Higher ups often stole ideas.  Wage rate was not increased by the agreed upon amount.  Hours promised for full-time allocated to store managers first and then given to favorite employees next.
good,"Early morning hours. Lack of advancement opportunities- like being in a high school popularity contest. Management is unresponsive at best and down right hostile at worst. I like Target as a corporation but the ball has been dropped, at least at this store."
good,"A typical work day is nonstop. The moment you get there you are expected to take care of everything that was not finished the shift before, as well as everything expected of you during your normal shift. At the lower positions you have to do what the supervisor says, but every supervisor has different ways of doing things. this job is great for someone who needs to start somewhere in the workforce, but it does not offer any advancement or long term service rewards. you can work there for 10 years, and make the same money as someone who works there for 10 days."
good,Target does have a good environment but the hourly rate for the week is terrible that's the reason why I got a second job in the first place any cut hours a lot they are not consistent with the hours they gave people
good,"my experience with target is that; favoritism; they give only the ones they favor hours, cross training hours, etc. i have only worked in another department 3 times in the 3 months of working, and they have asked if any one would work in the area or they were short. the management does not appreciate the workers they overload other workers to avoid giving even hours for every one. My work experience has been Horrible i do not recommend a friend to work at the Targert in Miamisburg, Ohio Dayton Mall location."
good,i liked the work and my immediate coworkers. The pay was good but the hours were horrible. I enjoyed interacting with the guests and the contests that were held by previous management who made work so much fun. I did not enjoy working 6 days per week and still not having 30 hours. Target scheduling is awful and I feel they only work with certain people on that. If you are a single mother I do not recommend working at target unless it is just a second job.
good,"In this job, I was shuffled around quite a bit which gave me the opportunity to both try and learn new things.  There are a lot of people (level) of command and thus there was a lot of mixed messages and bad communication."
good,Target on paper seems like a great place to gain work experience but that all depends on the store.  If you work at a higher end store the chances you will enjoy it are high but if you work at their lower end ones then they are usually ran pretty poorly.
good,It was a great learning experience in terms of how business's tend to operate on that level but being a temporary worker managers did not allow for role change. Management also changed often so when I returned I would have to be helping my manager do their job while they told me what to do and got paid more than I did.
good,"Working at Target could have been enjoyable. However, management did not allow me to cross-train.  I was constantly being passed over for lesser or inexperienced employees, making my work day intolerable."
good,Managers had unrealistic expectations for the staff. Their mission perspective did not reflect current customer behavior so there was waste of employee resources.
good,Mangers are very unprofessional and like to get involved in drama that they also create. They favorite employees and rarely give you days off you asked for. Overall a terrible work place
good,This job was one of my 1st jobs and one of my least favorites. the management team at the time had a bad sense of entitlement. their attitudes toward other workers where horrible.
good,I do not like it at all. They have poor management. When it comes to being considerate of others families they lack the feelings. If you arent there family they dont care about you protecting and taking care of yours.
good,"Targets isnt a nice place to work, I don't like the work we have to do I feel like we are underpaid or getting worked a lot and not getting paid for it."
good,"Lots of responsibility, with little to no help from management. Managers tend to make snap judgments about situations without consulting the people involved. Co-workers are great, but management is lacking."
good,"Helping customer service, Restocking the shelves, Locating products for customers, Management was not very good, Very busy atmosphere, Good friends, Good products"
good,Managers were terrible and were rarely there and so when evaluations came around it wasn't a fair assessment of how well you actually performed your job.
good,"Just stocked shelved, helped guests, occasionally worked electronics and the cart attendant positions. Really was just a first job, nothing more, nothing less."
good,When I was working at Target I got harassed by the team members of upper management. WAS a customer service associate.But I wasn't in the click so they put me to cashier.
good,"Target is not a job that you should stay at, especially as a main job, if you can avoid it. It's a decent source of side income as a second job, but you are just a number to corporate and management. The main pro is that you have to be a complete idiot in order to get fired."
good,"very competitive, and slow. most days the team leaders pushed us to sell a product or sign up for a charge card and if not we got in trouble. also we were pushed not too tell customers about sales if they were aware in the first place."
good,"Entry-level positions are good for temporary employees or young adults just entering the workforce.  As you grow within Target, employees are held to almost unattainable levels of productivity.  Constant pressure from managers and visiting leadership.  No work/life balance"
good,"Working here, it's very much managers vs. employees. I like working as a team more so the style of the work place didn't fit my personality. Overall, it was a mediocre place to work."
good,"Went to work for my fellow team member, left because management did not support my position. Good for a part time job but would not suggest staying any longer than necessary."
good,Love the company but for what I do I don't get paid enough and it's unfair. Team Members just coming in are getting more than me and their just team members! I am responsible for way more!
good,"They will hire anyone."
good,"No management that was organized, constantly dropped hours while still needing the same amount of work done, managers also did not help me once with official training so I learned everything i know on my own. Co workers all barely spoke English so i could not get help or assist anyone there really besides a select few individuals."
good,Management is rough i Honestly was too exhausted to function most times and that was not improved by the high stress environment would not recommend to anyone
good,"The people are great, but the only way to make a decent wage is by spending your entire life working. Breaks were very fair for the crazy hours. Management forced a specific ""culture"" down everyone's thoughts and made the environment annoying and uncomfortable."
good,Assisted with unloading of truck. Stocked the shelf's with merchandise. Put overstock back in warehouse. restocked put backs on shelf. prepared store for reopen daily.
good,"All in all besides very poor management and the lack of hours, Target was a good place to work for. The team was amazing and willing to work for one another."
good,"It’s not the first place I would recommend. It is lots of fun when you first start but the longer you’ve been there the worse it becomes. Raises are small, management is awful, and no one cares about your health and well being so make sure to take care of yourself"
good,The breaks were too short and the management was scattered and did not last long. There were too many people trying to tell you what to do as well as acting as if they were better than you merely because of their job title.
good,The schedules are very inconsistent if you are not in a management position. There are weeks that they only give you four hours. Yet it's like you are on call everyday if someone calls in or doesn't show. Frequently asked to stay over your time if scheduled for four to six hour shifts.
good,"The one I worked at was not managed very well. The benefits of working there was the 10% discount you get, the team you work with (depending on the department) was very supportive, you could make friends, it's a good place to work if it's just to make some extra cash and/or it's just temporary."
good,Great seasonal job. You can get all the hours you want usually. Customers are friendly and staff makes sure everything is always a good experience for guest.
good,The warehouse distribution center in Iowa is a very fast pace environment in a seasonal job with no mistakes my body could not do it a that speed for 10 hr days
good,Target was decent paying job. Had a long drive to amd from work. The benefits were good. The managemnet however was  not that great. Learned alot of different  job skills and functions while working there
good,"Management was to friendly with some people but would also get on others just for using the bathroom. Managers were unprofessional, some employees get away with drinking on the job just due to being friends with the managers."
good,"I started off at the beginning of the summer. Everything seemed like it was great: everyone was friendly and willing to help me learn everything, but eventually, fellow coworkers started causing drama, the LOD's started calling people out in front of everyone for silly mistakes, and the ""flexible scheduling"" wasn't so flexible anymore. The LOD's expect so much from you and if you can't do it all they are disappointed. At the end of the summer, there are at least 5 people including myself looking for work somewhere else because we hate it so much. Wanting to cry before going to work should not a regular occurrence."
good,I was transferred to target from Marshall Fields out of state and found the working conditions lacking and management uncaring. Target is  all about the bottom line. It is very difficult to talk to management much less get a quick response to questions about scheduling or answers at all. Overall it is not a bad company to work for but I would not choose it for a long term career.
good,"typical retail,did not learn much, mngmnt was ok, typical workplace  at Target, no hard part, enjoyed people and fellow workers. Working at Target was over three years ago and there have been many changes since."
good,"the Team members at Target are awesome. The Team members are courteous, its a pleasure to go to work just knowing they are there. Target is a wonderful store with everything you could possibly want for the home, clothes, garden, automotive, toys and food. I wish the store Managers and Team well."
good,Move up the people they like personally not the best fit for the job. STL wouldn't even leave the office all day much less hold a meeting more than once every two or three months.
good,At target working in the cafe I learned how to work fast paced and how to multitask. Management could be way better. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the managers and how they don't view your concerns.
good,Target is a good place for younger adults to work for a part time job on the side but not a realistic career. The higher up positions aren't taken seriously and half the people in the positions shouldn't be.
good,"Target is and always will be my favorite store to shop at, however working there was difficult simply because they do not guarantee hours. It is almost required of you to work two jobs or you won't be able to pay bills."
good,Hard work and bad pay. while all being micro managed by five different people. Telling you to do their projects. On top of your own jobs. Wish they would allow advancement. They just hire managers because of a piece of paper and no work related skills.
good,"My experience is based on the fact that I have been at one location for 5 years and has had 4 different managers.  It's cut-throat at times, no appreciation or recognition for hard work, and very dangerous doing security without proper personnel."
good,"Because Target is based on a hierarchy of team members, team leaders, and so on, the attitude of the workers are felt through and through. The employees that are in a slightly higher position take advantage of their position. They resort to favoritism and a bit of slacking off because they feel that they have other people to do it for them as a team lead. The job in general is not that hard to do. It is physically demanding, but is not a problem as it becomes a regular routine that is not that bad. The job description is enjoyable and relaxing if one enjoys organizing and sorting. The fast-paced moments are very intense, but again, was enjoyable to me, because it gave me goals to achieve and made me feel accomplished when I did finish them on time. Overall, a pleasant job if you do not get on the bad side of people. If you keep to yourself a bit, working at Target is a bit calming."
good,"Job had social net work an communication but not as much fun as working at other place's, back trash is not secure, séance murder happen by that store"
good,a typical day at work. slow sometimes fast-pace when it comes to peak hours. managements works with desired availability to work. they work around schedules if you have more than one job
good,it was a job that i was required to do.  i did what i had to do but other people had bad days and interfered with mine that was not right and because of that i am out of work.
good,"The company in really nit worker friendly, the promotions are more for the supervisors, while the majority of the work is being done by the workers! Supervisors are not very friendly"
good,I enjoyed helping customers with their purchases. I think the hardest part of the job was trying to convince people to get a store credit card when there had been a scam. I definetely learned that you will get all kinds of people good and bad in customer service.
good,You will be expected to open up red cards and you are graded on how fast you can ring. The job you are hired for is all you will do its hard to be cross trained. Also the hours are terrible and they pay terrible.
good,I worked in several different departments. Much of your hard work goes unnoticed when management plays favorites. I worked with some truly great people and they made the job worthwhile.
good,Working at Target sucks the Joy out of your life.  Its not so much the Guests.....Its the Management and People they hire....And if your Higher in the Management scale they expect you to do everything single handily with NO Help.
good,"It was a lot of hard work standing on your feet all day, there were never enough employees at the front which meant a lot of work for the employees that were at the front, and the expectation that was placed on employees for selling the company's credit cards was absurd, to be frank."
good,"I was the only person who had open availability in softlines, yet was only scheduled to close and denied days I needed off. They took advantage of me being the hardest worker."
good,the workplace environment is ok the people are very friendly. but the management is absolutely clueless about the business. the best part of the job was the customers
good,There is a lack of organization and leadership. People are barely working half the time and there is not much of a incentive not to. There is not enough cashiers to deal with the amount of customers and there is a lack of urgency for management to help out. There a re plenty of times that change was needed and it would take minimum of fifteen minutes to get it causing a back up at the register.
good,Place steers towards a lot of favoritism and the younger crowd. If you are liked and get along with leads working there can be fun and worth while.  Mostly part time work.
good,They do not  appreciating their employees and it's never any hours for you to work they also want you to make target you life with very little pay you can't support yourself or a family working at selfish company like target in Crestwood unless you been working there for 15 pluses years
good,"Target acts like they care about their employees when in all fairness they really don't. They promise you upon hiring that you will be able to get a lot of hours. Then when they hit a rough season or need to do training they take away hours without you being informed. Paid vacation is given in hours. Which is determined based off of the hours you work weekly. It took me two years just to earn 40 hours of vacation. Then on top of that you're not always guaranteed paid vacation. They have to make sure they have hours to pay you for the vacation that you want to take. Although you work hard to earn those vacation hours. In all honesty, I would never recommend target as a work place for anyone. Maybe as a second job but certainly not as a full time job."
good,"They are not very organized, i asked for a schedule change to match my school schedule at least four times.  I was never granted that schedule change and was forced to misss work due to school. I was then fired due to me missing work."
good,"I love Target. I shop there multiple times a week. So what better job then at Target?!? Plus I love retail and customer based jobs. When I started during the holidays, the environment was incredibly fast paced, but it was driven, supportive, and encouraging."
good,Daily Routines change day to day.  The team members are amazing and great to work with.  My most enjoyable part of the job is helping the team with any questions concern they may have.
good,"Worked over nights when store was closed.  I stocked shelves and racks.  I mostly worked in the grocery department.  Unload the shipments, separate and brake down into departments.  I ran the register for a short period of time"
good,"Good balanced job for a student in school If looking for a stable, steady job this is not that. Some of the management is good, while others lack experience, and are not professional."
good,"Not even mediocre, pay was okay at best. Boring. Don't try to innovate or make a productive call, they want you to be a redcard robot and push their credit card."
good,"Strives for growth and development within the company. Definitely worth the fight towards motivating and shaping yourself through team building, guest service, time management and corporate America. "
good,Woderful company to work for if you are looking for a part tine job or second job.  Great for college students. No benefits but if you work fulk time there is.
good,"Success at this job requires a fake, extroverted personality. Skill and hard work are not rewarded. Dishonest management ensures you cannot trust even agreements made. Do not work here unless you are ok with being fake or not planning to stick around for more than a month."
good,"Felt like a number, never any encouragement just do more, do more, faster, faster. Management talked to you like children and wouldn't even allow you to take lunch out of the building."
good,I worked the front end cashiering and the customer service returns desk.  Very short hours were given but the coworkers were friendly and helpful.  I left to work at Walmart.
good,"I was a seasonal cashier for Target, and hated every minute of it. It was very repetitive and boring. I was constantly having to push their Target credit card to the point of annoyance. ""how many credit applications did you get today?"" was the only thing i heard from management, that's all they seemed to care about."
good,I enjoyed the actual job and responsibilities but the time frame in which all was expected to be completed was unreasonable. Managers were rarely available for assistance and were known to be disrespectful towards team members. I was not given the hours or pay I was promised and believed I had earned. It is a very stressful environment. I worked very hard and was never recognized for the work I did. A lot of effort for almost nothing.
good,"I am a current employee, I hate it! For the most part, the people I wok with are cool. But the hours are horrible!!! hours have dropped drastically. I haven't made 20 hours in one week in about two months. If you want something part time, this would be the perfect job for you. However, if you have real bills to pay and it would be your only form of income, I don't suggest it. Oh, and management does NOT care about the employees. All they care about is you showing up for your shift."
good,"i love working with people and this is a great job to do that with, but having to press credit cards on someone when im only a cashier and not a membership rep is just crazy. a huge negative is getting fired/let go from a place like this just because you don't sell their credit cards (this didn't happen to me). That being said the coworkers i had were amazing and even the pushy managers being forced upon us were very nice people at heart."
good,"fast pace and time limits, multi tasking with cleaning and guest service, special jobs that deal with detail. I learned a lot about time management. Hardest part was repetition of lifting but I worked with great group of people"
good,"if you work hard but the people around you don't you are still held accountable."
good,"This employer is a good first job but it's nothing more. My review is solely based on the store I am at, not the whole company. The management is one of the main problems at my location. I have been with the company for years and am not valued or appreciated. Unless you are a favorite you will not advance or receive hours. Raises are once a year and it is literally a couple of pennies raise."
good,I did not enjoy this job simply because the enviroment is very biased and favouritism is abundant. I would of be much more happy if the schedule had been more consistant and if everyone worked as hard as i do or as a few of the others did.
good,"Fast paced and if you can't accomplish the task you are assigned to then you are called slow. It is all about the profit. I was working on 4-5 pallets by myself, had to unpack and place merchandise on the shelves by myself, no additional help. No or barely any benefits. Management is coming to work late, more then once. Very much micro management and you are being timed on your job through the video cameras. This particular place was hard to make friends with other employees and watch your back. I helped others with finishing their responsibilities but when I needed help there was no one there."
good,being their at 2.am unload trucks and stock merchandise. helping guests find products and answering questions and helping where help is needed.
good,This company does not care about the employee needs and the management was very lousy. Worst job i have ever had.. I will never work for this company ever agian
good,"Target is a great consumer company, the issue lies in its treatment of staff at least at the neshaminy target. The management is mostly clueless, and only wants to impress district and corporate. scheduling is not flexible, and employment opportunities beyond entry level are few and far between. It is akin to having a wagon being led by a blind horse with blinders on."
good,At Target you are assigned to do what is on your job description. You don't have surprises. The only surprises here are new policies being brought about. Target is a low paying company. Its a less busier company then their competitor. Target management actually helps employees do their work slightly. They are more respectful to your schedule and you can balance work and school. At Target you are treated like a employee before a person. If you ever have to take a LOA make sure they compensate you for it. I don't really see people move up unless theyre cool with management. Customers here are extremely rude.
good,"I would like work in the day. I learned to stock right shelves and gesture with hearing people. My management is going great. My co-workers are nice and great, but some is not. My hardest part of the job is communicate with hearing people. My enjoyable part of the job is independent and my own pace work area."
good,"My personal experience with Target and its subsidiaries is of the unprofessional nature of them and their employees. I've learned that if you are looking to create a career at all out of a job there, you're out of luck. My co-workers are fine, they are as professional as you might expect from a worker with little to no experience."
good,"Pros"
good,It was only seasonal. i got in around 1 am clocked in and we did a team meeting. management was on time and energetic. coworkers were good people.hardest part was carrying things around after being stationary for a year. my coworkers were the only enjoyable thing.
good,"I loved working at Target, it was a fun and exciting place. However, as open as they are to different lifestyles, they also discriminate against those different lifestyle."
good,"there was a huge turnover in both management and team members,  the training was hit and miss.  there was a lot of favoritism.  "
good,"Target Canada declared bankruptcy, and laid off all there staff with no warning. Most employees found out on social media."
good,target is very strict on what you can and can not do. i was in jeopardy of losing my house that if i hadn't paid rent in someway i was on the streats and they did not care.
good,There isn't much to be said about Target because I was there just for seasonal work. We started at 4 in the morning and was to be done by 9:00 - 10:00. The managers were extremely rude and very unprofessional. But when I worked the cashier position I loved being there and staying busy. As a whole it was a good place to work.
good,"Average place to start working, not a great place to stay longterm.  Use the experience here to springboard elsewhere.  The hours at first  were great but eventually they are cut drastically like average 20hrs a week.  Was promised fulltime hours but eventually cut back.  Do not take anything for granted with this company."
good,it was a decent place to work. Management was very strict and would not let you leave until everything was perfect. Pay and hours were horrible. I closed and sometimes would not leave until 2-3Am
good,it was a hostile work enviroment whenever you had a problem i felt. i didn't feel i could trust anyone. I felt like it was like being in high school.
good,the worst company to work for well at least the brandywine store was a horrible place of work management is ridiculous and they like to keep and choose who get promoted that store is the worst.
good,I normally helped run the coffee shop inside the store. I would provide excellent customer service and assist customers in discovering new and interesting flavors. I also helped in opening and closing duties as well as checked out customers when needed.
good,My typical day is usually one of frustration due to the store being understaffed. I have many coworkers that I can call friends but management is something that definitely needs to be worked on. I learn something new every day since I deal with the public but I feel that that is challenging in itself. The hardest part of my job is dealing with unhappy guests and/or dealing with complaints.
good,"Target likes to hire toddlers that have just graduated from college that have no retail experience at all.  this way they can train them in the ways of Target.  Moving up in the company is almost impossible unless you find  a manager you can suck up to and get on your side.  raises are only given once a year and they are small, typically 5-15 cents and hour.  no cost of living raises unless you're management."
good,"Overall this company has changed in a lot of ways positive and negative. Every store is different culture and favoritism wise. Unfortunately it was time to move forward with my career . Hardest part was seeing how leadership changed for the bad. Seeing peers say false statements about being there for you and calling you ""family"". When I needed them the most they happen to turn their back.. Enjoy :)"
good,i had an not so good experience working at target. i feel they don't treat they employee with respect and not giving either hours to work.
good,"Real friendly at the hiring process but that is a front ,Some of the management unfriendly, only trained one day then on your own, not real hard of a job but out put must be met after 2months or your not hireable. sending people home all the time."
good,"A typical work day at work consists of heavy telephone volume, payroll, attending to team members, and editing work schedules for the store employees."
good,"This was my very first job so I don't have much that is bad to say about it. Little to no room in advancement. At first there were great managers that had worked there, they moved on to positions at different Target locations and that's when it all went downhill. My first raise was $.01 which was a slap in the face especially when I had thought I was working hard for the company. Taking on backroom stocking positions and production floor positions. Not a very good place to work if you're looking to advance in any way shape or form. A great place to work if you're just trying to get some entry level experience under your belt."
good,The first job of the night is to unload the delivery truck. As we unload the truck our job is to sort out the merchandise by location in the store. A group of workers will move the pallets of merchandise to the floor and begin to stage the merchandise in the aisle at the proper location. After the staging is complete we will than open the merchandise and fill the shelves.
good,"I learned how to manage a business."
good,"the mess there would be after business hours, customers are very rude, management was horrible. they never let employees defend themselves."
good,"I learned other job titles during my training as we all helped set up for the grand opening at the metrotown location. I learned how to backstock, product count, flyer sales team who put out throughout the whole store place sale tags according to the flyer, and make adjustments if tags missing or had mistakes fix; then reprint. so there were sometimes I'd be pulling a double shift, multitasking at it's best. put-back items, restocking, food market detailing, branding overall entire store. communication skills, team oriented, product knowledge, learning basic store layout for customer help."
good,"Management is terrible in this location, the store is very disorganized and its difficult for guests to buy things with such little staff.  The team is great, just management needs improving."
good,Under Paid and the management was horrible at my store. Target cares more about dollars and red cards then they do their team members happiness
good,"My experience at Target seemed to be unique compared to others. I loved my coworkers and I liked the work. It was easy. I was hired when I was 17, and my store closed. My store didn't have much opportunity for advancement because of budgeting and the fact that we were so low-volume. Great environment, good management excited to build relationships with subordinates. Never even met my district manager, however."
good,This is not a career job. My typical day was to unload trailers for 10hrs very easy work and not rewarding at all. The management team was very inconsistent will dealing with conflict management and workload distribution
good,"I worked at Target on a part-time basis as a backroom team member. Target seems a good company. Pros: flexible scheduling; friendly coworkers willing to help each other. Cons: indifferent, out-of-touch managerial team. Management is the sole pitfall of working for Target. Often management had unrealistic expectations for work performance. Management had no idea of how difficult and tiring a back room position is; they had little respect for how hard backroom staffers work."
good,Target was one of my very first jobs. It was a very good place to get your customer service skills on par. Not many opportunities to make a better income or move up in management. Not a lot of room to grow.
good,"A typical day at Target would be helping customers and other team members in need. Providing great customer service and having a presentable store for out customers. I've learned how to communicate better with other people in person and over the phone. Also, how to multitask and get the job done on time. Target has also taught me how to use the new technology that is provided to us, such as Mydevices and PDA's. Working with my co-workers is a great experience because they are all different and provide great customer service to the customers. They all work in their own unique ways to get the job done. Lastly, they have great personalities that the customers seem to enjoy. I would say the hardest part of the day would be to maintain a presentable looking store on our busiest days and having enough time to finish our task when we are not assisting cashiers. The most enjoyable part of the day is allowing the customers to leave satisfied and happy. Also, to work with all of my co-workers."
good,"Target has been going through a lot of changes in the last few year."
good,Very productive workplace. People didn't communicate with other team members. Always managed somehow to do other peoples job.
good,Management not very good the employees are often over worked very busy and not enough team members. No good benefits not a fun friendly place to work at.
good,No room for growth with little motivation. Too little pay for so much responsibility. It's good for an 18 year old just starting off but not good for an adult that needs to pay bills.
good,"too many shifting priorities, lack of cohesion on focus from top down management strategy, minimal payroll, stress from breach and canadian excess, spitting out managers on the regular becoming a turnstile"
good,"I like working here but I am needing a full time job with more money."
good,"I gained lots of experience of the inner workings of this company. Not all of it was good, but the education given to me will help me better myself in the future."
good,"Have worked here 6 days a week with the owner up close and personal for almost 5 years now, I am sorry to say there are no advancement opportunities or branches where I would like to go."
good,A typical day at work would be to unload the trucks and push out the product. I learned to become a leader and to manage a small group of employees. My fellow peers are amazing to work with. The hardest part of working for target Is the management. The best part of working for target is knowing that your co-workers have your back and its like working with family.
good,This is good as a starting job to get your feet wet in the real world. Its good experience to test patience and social skills.
good,"Work day is very fast pace, learned how to interact with guest, store manager as well as supervisor are friendly but they lie. The team members are really friendly. The hardest part of the job you must be able to stand for long periods of time. the fun part is being able to meet different types of people."
good,"Unload the truck then assigned to specialty areas or continue on to stock shelves."
good,"I would not make a career out of working at Target. This is a part time work, until you find a better job or it you are finishing School."
good,"I have been with Target for many years. It used to be a decent place to work, but the store I am working at is the worst. I have been at the 0747 Lawrenceville location for the whole time I have been at Target, and it has really gone downhill. Our store seems to be the dumping ground for terrible managers. They are rude, fake, disrespectful, they never back you up when it comes to issues with customers and let dishonest customers get away with anything, we are constantly working understaffed, the sales floor team members never come up for back up in the morning, they pay stinks. Cashiering is is only suitable for teenagers. Adults can't make a living on this pay.We can never keep any cashiers because that is the worst job in the whole store other than cart attendant, they constantly threaten the cashiers about losing their jobs if they don't get enough RED cards. RED cards are all they care about. We can't make a customer sign up for RED cards. All we can do is ask. I have had enough at being at this store and being in retail. I hope to either find a new job somewhere else or at least move somewhere else in the store because I cannot stand being a cashier anymore. If someone wants to take a chance with Target as an employer, please, do not apply to the Lawrenceville store. I guarantee you'll be quitting within a month if not sooner."
good,"This is a great job for a student looking to earn extra cash, but not someone trying to pay their bills."
good,"Bosses use you, make you feel unnoticed, under appreciated. I did learn to cashier and customer service, sometimes dealing with customers was hard, they weren't very understanding at times and very picky."
good,sometimes work would be very confusing they didnt always communicate with one another. they also didnt listen to what the employe concers were.
good,Restocking the store in the morning was pretty fun.  The hours were difficult. Management was easy to get along with and fun to talk to. The only reason I left was because the hours were too difficult to work around while having a home life.
good,"They will not let you move around in the company where you want to, only where they need you.  They are about advancement, but where it suits their needs.  Typical retail environment they will have you work harder with less and expect high results.  "
good,It was a good starter job if your looking to be a cashier. The mangers and co-workers were really helpful. Day to day tasks were simple once you got the hang of it.
good,Target is a great place to work to get job experience especially when you are a full-time student. Extremely flexible with schedules and understands how important school is to its young employees. The hardest parts of working at Target is that there isn't much push or encouragement for advancement.
good,Its an ok job depending on the managers you work with. They demand so much out of you but refuse to pay or treat you according to your work ethics. To me it seem like the people that work hard gets the bad end of the stick while the lazies get to roam free.
good,"On you feet the most part of your schedule."
good,"A typical day at Target as a cashier is stressful because all the company cares about is redcards. The company wants people to be cheerleaders and NOT employees. I didn't learn anything and was put in a corner with a book to learn my job alone.  The managers give you no direction and don't allow you to learn other departments.The hardest part of the job is selling redcards after the security breach. The company has employees lie and say that the redcards wern't compromised but the credit redcards were, the debits were not. If you like being cornered in a dark room for a half hour after your shift is over for not selling enough redcards then this is the job for you. You will often be written  up or fired for not selling enough redcards. They do offer rewards for selling redcards which is positive, and free flu shots."
good,"Great atmosphere with a great team. The training is not very detailed though, the online modules are not very helpful and there is not really any hands on training"
good,"Typically you would have 8-20 hours a week. You couldn't depended on the schedule, it would change without notice.The Manager was very good and was always there to help you. I enjoyed working with most everyone and working as a team. Being cross-trained for a different position was nearly impossible. They would have you work in different areas (sometimes the entire week or two) that had a higher pay rate without giving you the hourly rate for that area. The health insurance was too  expensive. They stopped providing health insurance for part-timers."
good,"Target was a good job to have while in college as far as flexibility, but they do not compensate well. They did not provide any benefits and management was very poor."
good,They say they want to be the best company ever but they have started neglecting their team members within the last 3 years.
good,"The day begins at 6 a.m. It is all about getting your individual rate for the day. Pulling orders as fast as humanly possible. The co-workers are for the most part great people. They to are expected to achieve the rate needed to work there. The management people practice micro-management, which on some days make hitting rate hard or near impossible. The most enjoyable part of the job is time goes quickly for being 10 hour shifts."
good,"Target started out as a great place to work, I started just a month after the store opened and LOVED it. I met my now husband there. I made many friends however as time went on the management came and went and only got worse with each new Store Manager. I went on maternity leave and when i came back I did get my 40 hours however it dimished down to only 12 hours a week which also made me loose my insurance. I left the following March, after almost 9 years of being there I should have been one of the most important employees working."
good,"Started at 4:00 am on a part-tine schedule"
good,I just left Target this week to explore a new opportunity.  I was with this company for 8 years. In the beginning it was great until this year when the company made changes and cut down on certain positions. Upper leadership is not hands on and consistently throw more work on you. You can advance if you in the right district and you are a favorite.  But by prepared to have no life.
good,"Typical day is all sales driven and customer service. I learned more about individual products and sales pitches. Management was continuously rotating, there was at least 5 new managers every year so my opinion on it is void because it was never the same managing practice. My co-workers were fun to work with, they were very hard working and I learned majority of my sales/ inventory experience from them. The hardest part of the job is clocking in at 4am and entering a -30 degree Fahrenheit freezer right after, I actually developed a mild asthma from that. Most enjoyable part was learning from my co-workers."
good,This company will take the best manager in the world and make them the worst. Your job is micro managed everyday and the accountability is horrible. The upper management required a certain amount of write ups a week whether or not the employees deserved one or not.
good,"-loading/unloading trucks"
good,"I enjoyed working at target. I enjoyed getting cross trained to work in other areas when needed. I even enjoyed the face to face assisting of guests via in store and over the phone. I do have to say that I did not enjoy the limited hours(<30 per week) and not being able to pick up extra hours over 40 was very much so an unappealing aspect of the job. Target is a good place to get your foot in the door on retail and sales, sorting and stocking shelves, and even pricing and marketing, but I do not suggest it to anyone trying to make a career of retail or sales. All employees are considered part time (no matter what they tell you), there are no benefits provided, and they reserve the right to fire you on the spot within your first 60-90 days. Target is a very uppity place and they require you to be unnaturally pleasant and chipper regardless of your situation."
good,Working for target was great. i loved the guests but the management wasn't willing to work with me when it came to my schedule.
good,"7 AM. count down drawers"
good,Great place to work everyone is super nice and very helpful.
good,It really doesn't give you the chance to grow within the company
good,"In a typical 8 hour work day, several projects and tasks are assigned to a team member by various managers throughout the store. Poor communication between leadership leads to multiple tasks not being carried out in as efficient and timely of a manner as they could be. Team members work very hard, but the combination of ineffective management and poor compensation make this an unrewarding job. Excellent to learn basic retail skills such as inventory management and customer service, but not an ideal place to advance or pursue a career."
good,"fork lift operator, learned how to use a forklift and how a warehouse operates, management was not very knowledgeable about workers jobs co-workers were helpful.  hardest part of job was the physical stress on your body and the best part of the job was the money"
good,"-A typical work day at target started about six in the evening, you have to be there for a couple of years before you were able to get a  day shift. "
good,I worked with men and women coming home from prison helping them become productive members of society.
good,"this job was really strict, the management had their ""favorites"" and everyone else would be stuck doing extra work."
good,I would help drill measured wholes into PVC pipe for the Mines
good,Hardest part of the job was the constant pace we had to be and the amount of work dumped on the backroom folks by people whom did not finish there work from earlier in the day. Management did not get to involved with a majority of the sales floor team members namely the new guys such as myself but when something was not right they got involved heavily. The most enjoyable part was occasionally they would provide food for the staff on certain days.
good,"no room to advance, no team work, no hours,management not friendly dont train properly"
good,"I didn't work there very long, I was only a seasonal worker. However I did move quickly to other departments. I learn very quickly."
good,Its an ok place to work if your a teenager needing a little minimum wage but not for someone who needs bill money. Raises are only .13 cents and they start you at minimum wage.
good,My job has become more about customer service then security.
good,"On a daily basis I bank the lanes, delegate tasks to each cashier, give great guest service, and problem solve any difficult situations. "
good,"I was there for a year. training team members, organizing my team for the day, and providing great guest service. I had to train my boss, which I did not enjoy. I also don't understand the management when they wouldn't schedule people for a shift and call at last minute to cover it."
good,"Being an Operator was a challenging experience.. Faced multiple calls about times,products and recommendations"
good,what I learned here are valuable logistic skills that can help me further my experience in the retail businesses.
good,"Very busy from time of beginning to end of shift"
good,"Unloading trucks at Target was always fun for me.  I'm the type of person who likes to make the workplace fun and enjoyable.  My co-workers were great people, and a select few team leaders I would do anything for.  The hours available was horrible.  I was scheduled approximately 15 hours a week.  My insurance was cancelled without my notification because I did not work enough hours in 2012.  Overall, I was not satisfied."
good,"had a stable work environment"
good,If you enjoy retail & changing shifts then this is for you. Some people are just miserable to work with but it's target
good,"The workplace can be great place to work.Its fast, fun and a friendly environment. Sometimes the hardest part of the day can be when all your hard work are often not seen but yet a bad day can be all the see."
good,A typical day at work at Target was ok i try to make the best of any situation  I must say i did learn alot because the atmosphere was very different with lots of different people  learned how to interact with a large amount of people on a daily basis how to use certain electronical equipment also to manage to stay calm and professional while operating 6 different phone lines and greeting each and every customer with a smile. Managment could have been much more professional though there were a select few great managers there . Co-workers at Target were great we had a great team though sometimes there were disagreements we all manage to come together as a team. I would say the hardest part of my experience at Target would be when someone left a big work load behind and having to finish my work load and theirs before the store closed. The most enjoyable part of my experience was putting a smile on the  customers faces knowing the left satisfied and the great comments they would leave about the great service they experienced from myself.
good,"Fast, Fun & Friendly is what they talk about.  However, it depends on the management of the store.  This can vary greatly from store to store.  They do not promote from within as they say they do.  It's a busy environment, you stand all day so you're tired at the end of your shift.  If you don't have a university degree, you will never be hired as anything more than a Team Member.  It's an ok survival job when you need it."
good,"No work life balance, job is always under pressure to do more with less."
good,I appreciate the bond that I have with my co-workers.There are unfortunately days where that is the only thing that keeps me motivated. Target is a large company that keeps expanding I feel as though because of that the happiness of the employees and management has fallen through the cracks.
good,"not the friendliest place in the world, management wouldn't make time to help you out too much or would do it with a poor attitude. enjoyable part of my day would have to be talking to the guests."
good,They don't really care about employees and they would rather fire you then help you advance
good,You get too busy stocking to store and getting yelled at by managers who have never even stocked themselves. It was hard to get ahead and working all night wore out your body.
good,"that's there motto,its an alright place to work but they under pay you,and with the weird hours that my shift is i would think that the management would be more uplifting"
good,"When I was there, we got run ragged. We were usually short staffed and whoever was there was usually too busy complaining to get their work done on time, so we often didn't get to leave until after 11 pm. Management didn't usually entrust us to be able to complete our tasks so they were constantly down everybody's throats, even the good workers that got their stuff done. There wasn't really a ""most enjoyable part of the job"", but at least the associates were occasionally fun to talk to. A few people were given promotions, but they were the ones that bought the bosses lunch. A very high turnover rate."
good,"Cashier, we stocked shelves, it was a fast paced work environment"
good,"I worked there for over a year and most of my experience was fine, however I was shocked at how they treat their pregnant team members!"
good,i work doing revisions which includes moving product changing labels strips and so forth. since we have all new management with in the last year it seems like its a college there whenever you go to the managment nothing gets done no matter who you talk to. I really enjoy working with my other co-workers we all work together to get the job done that we need to. The hardest part of my job is getting the extra help when it is needed. I love doing my job because it keeps me busy its fast paced and time flys by
good,Worked 6 AM to 2:30 PM as a Store Facilities Technician/Manager.
good,I wasn't able to cross train in other departments because my team lead wouldn't allow it. When my hours got cut in the one department I was trained in I would work sometimes as little as 12 hours a week. I could set the aisles I was assigned and then some extra aisles on top of those and I would still be told that I wasn't working fast enough.
good,"provide the best customer service to guest,I learned tough skin.management is pretty ok & fair,I loved my coworkers.It was a hard job,I enjoyed meeting people"
good,"It's like being back in high school. If your Manager doesn't like you or you're not ""sucky up"" you will never get promoted."
good,They often provide free food which was needs by some team members because of the low pay
good,"its a fast pace work place, constantly moving around, standing for 8 hours, making calls to sales floor for prices and questions, doing cash transactions. management needed some help when working there. co-works are great, nice and talkative, some are excellent while others need so more direction."
good,Simple job unload a truck stock on the floors.
good,"Employer gives great benefits, downfall is very low pay with with many unhappy customers."
good,"A typical day was hectic, there was so much to do in so little time. I learned most of the ends and outs to workig in retail. The management did not have any compassion for the workers personal life, they just didnt care. The hardest part was having to clean an entire area in a small time frame while having guest shop the area. The most enjoyable was my co workers, they made the work day bearable"
good,Good place to work as a entry level job. Little pay but as entry level it is alright.
good,"A typical day starts with a huddle, and right after, we team up with our Executive Team Leaders and go over the days itinerary. Our most important task was to always take care of the guests first. I came from a Warehousing background, and learned as much as I could in a short period of time. I got so good,I was Employee of the Month. I loved training new hires, and was not happy when anyone on our team quit."
good,"Loved the work, but was promised advancement if I accomplished certain activities. Never happened the fired every manager in the buiding work moral very down the last two years I was there."
good,"The staff and co-workers are very friendly and understanding, but if the Target is not doing well in the area, hours are cut drastically."
good,"a typical day at work for me consist of assisting dept manager, supervising the cashiers, overseeing the electronics dept, and some logistics work. i have learned to be a leader of men, auditing merchandise (inventory), patience with the public in hostile situations or big events, gaining the trust of management and peers in certain situations. learning how to work with different managers and coworkers. Hardest part of job was probably getting multiple tasks done in a high customer volume store while assisting customers simutaneously. The most enjoyable part of the job was honestly my abiltiy to assist the customers in need, putting smiles on faces, and having my own specific task that made big differences with the development of store."
good,I liked working around video games and electronics. The Management was really big and didn't really pay attention to employee needs or concerns. Some management was verbally abusive to employees. The Job its self was pretty easy. The hours were horrible.
good,"I have to say my team members were awesome but hr and managers were always contradicting themselves. Supposed to be very organized company but the schedule would change last minute without any notice, rules were always changing and never made any sense to why, and you are never guaranteed 40 hours per week if you signed up for full time. Those would be some of the hardest things to deal with. Most enjoyable time is during the holidays when Target gave back to the communities in the surrounding areas. You also get to work in different areas so you will never do the same thing twice. Your team members are very loyal and loving. Your typical day could be in clothing, electronics, groceries, back stock or appliances."
good,I enjoyed the time I spent working for Target. The employees that were always willing to help in any way they could. I learned most of my management skills here. My co-workers were made the long hours easier to deal with. The hardest part of my job was undergoing all the new diffrent management styles that would come in and out. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowing that my team and I had met and most times exceeded our goals.
good,"A typical day at work would be, assisting guest in the store, and clerical duties. I learned a lot about retail and how to keep a store running smoothly. Both management and co-workers we good to work with."
good,Working on the pricing team was good. I worked 6am to 2:30pm mon. thru fri.
good,"Target is a great company to our guests; the policies are fair, and I love that team members take pride in helping guests."
good,I did so much work for this company and none of it was ever recognized. They weren't looking out for their workers or for the customers but only themselves. Shifts were awful and hours were ripped off.
good,"Be fast ,fun,and friendly.Create signature coffee and non-coffee beverages."
good,My co workers there a fun and friendly its just that management is a two face and dont care if you are leaving or need to change your schedule. They use you for wat they can and then forget all about you.
good,"Great creating and building my customer service skills! On a daily basis worked hands on with customers, stocked and re-ordered stock. I also ran a register when needed."
good,"I worked for the company for 6 years. The advancement process takes longer than that though. It was a hard comapany to advance with. Although the people who shop there are wonderful to help, the management is terrible. They hire people who have no reguard for the people they work with and hire to the company. I believe the management of any company you work for should be caring to the employees who basically make the company and run it. The benefits could be better. For such a high profiting company and grossing, they should have wonderful benefits. Overall rating for this company for me is ""Fair"". If your looking for a decent paying job for the summer it's perfect. Not a place for advancement AT ALL."
good,Very long hours... I would work 6-7 days a week 10-12 hours a day to come clean on processes. Sometimes little to no help from peers. Great starter management experience but career opportunities tend to bottle neck at the logistics position.
good,I feel like they can work more to help each other than attack one another for stuff not getting done.
good,Great opportunity to gain significant exposure to operations and logistics environment. High scool graduates looking to gain some hands on and management experience should strongly consider.
good,I was a cashier at Target but it felt lik they only let me work when someone called out. i got hired for 20 hours or more i was lucky to get 15 hours.
good,"Management staff were often aggressive towards employees, coming unhinged at small mistakes and offering no advice on how to fix them. Though Target paid well, the constant threat of losing my job was hung over my head when I made a mistake. Do not work here unless you are absolutely desperate."
good,Manager don't know what there doing. HR don't know how to schedule people whose on the truck.over stock backroom with too much stuff where you can walk
good,Target is currently undergoing direction changes as of 2020. These changes dramatically harm existing employees and lower my opinion of them as an employer greatly.
good,"At the location I interviewed at, the job itself was straightforward, but management is iffy. Social gossip is very prevelant and pervasive throughout the location."
good,Help you with certain responsibilities that you as a person has to take care of. It’s turns you more mature and to give you the right mindset to what you need in the future
good,Management and corporate are all about bonuses for themselves.  Hours are up and down and pay does not equal the amount of work and responsibility that is expected.  Not a long term job for most.
good,It started out great but the goals are not do able  management and HR don’t care about you or helping they just want to overwhelm you until you break  they aren’t understanding about disabilities they make comments on weight and how your makeup looks
good,"fun place to work at with problems like any other job. but don't expect to get many hours. it all depends on your target. your co-workers could be amazing people like at mine, or they could be rude it all depends on how your target manages the moral at their location."
good,"During my interview, my interviewer observed my skills to be equal to a team lead or higher. However, I was only offered starting pay. I like that Target would provide monthly incentives/activities that was posted in the break room."
good,The higher up management really don't have any training or direction.  Too many employees at corporate office who admit to not knowing at all what they are supposed to do however getting paid for working half days.  Health benefits are good
good,"Often times working at target felt like a hassle, not because of the workload but because of the out of place management. It seemed that none of the managers ever knew what they were doing, and expected WAY to much."
good,"I honestly never knew what end was up. The managers always said guest/customers are first! But then when you help a customer when your on the floor, you get the talk from you Team lead about ohhh don't leave your area. Your on my time. Then when you don't go and help the area or customer you get the talk again but the opposite. They have in realistic expectations for someone starting out. Especially in fulfilment. You don't really get proper training in it. Your hours are always out of wack. And  almost never got 40 hours.  They only care about the number a not you as a person a employee or how good over all you worked. Even if you worked hard everyday.covered for many areas and came in on days off because of call ins. They will train you in different areas. And never  keep you in the area that's your main and expect you to know your area and do it just like others that have been there for a year plus."
good,"This company is unorganized with not only their workload, but their employees hours as well. It lacks the ability to encourage team members and leaves no sense of accomplishment."
good,Target was a good first job for me. This was an experience but this honestly a quick job that someone can have just to find another job.I enjoyed being around some of the people but the management was really bad and not organized. They are not accommodating to people's lives and having to not be able to work a certain day.
good,If you start here and work at the entry level they will scrap you like you never existed if they so please. I came into this company as a contractor for a one year contract. Target terminated my contract after just 5 months for no real explanation.
good,"A great first job out of high school that can teach you simple work habits that you will need going forward, but a hard place to recommend for a legitimate career."
good,"I learned how to be really good at customer service. I really liked getting to know some of the regulars, and enjoyed working with so many people.  I enjoy working by myself and I got the chance to do that but still worked in groups and got to make a lot of my coworkers friends."
good,"This place doesnt care about you as a person/employee at all. The pay is good, but thats about where the good stops. You are treated poorly, they lie about caring about safety, but when a safety incident happens, all they're worried about is not having to stop productivity. If you need money, good job. If you want a social life, a good state of mind, flexible hours, compassionate/understanding bosses, this is not the job for you. They will treat you like the hourly scum that you are to them."
good,"Target was an okay company to work for, they were very strict on there schedules, they wanted you to work a lot but then would call you and tell you not to come in."
good,"As a second job, it was fun and very encouraging to do more and learn. I felt like it was a good starting point in the work force. The management there wasn't as motivated as I thought but nonetheless they kept us busy and we were able to get our job done."
good,"Management was the real issue. Nepotism, opulent office politics, frequent drama between employees. Harassment complaints from some employees are acknowledged, but not addressed. Workplace bullying is rampant if one wrong person favored by a member of management feels slighted. Professionalism and general work ethic declines with the feeling of lack of care from management. The compensation is good for the kind of work, but not the amount of it. Punishment, write-ups, and calls to the office are frequent if the amount of work put upon you is not 100% completed regardless of prior shift's neglect of daily tasks. In the food service area, some rules will not be conveyed, and you will be punished for not knowing them."
good,"If you have stubborn and persistence, you'll be able to work in onalaska, but if your kind and friendly, you'll have a horrible experience. So good luck to you."
good,"I used to work at McKinley park target and all I gotta say is that they don’t care. Management sucks, they have favoritism and are unfair. But the employees are the best! Worst customers I’ve ever dealt with in my job history."
good,"Management is, for the most part, helpful. But you'll get ZERO feedback on your performance, and if you do, it'll be passive/aggressive. Top leader is a good guy; he'd do anything for you. But I had offered my help multiple times to cross-train people and HR declined my help. Yet they fail to hire and retain people. Over and over again. Frustrating."
good,"If you get along with your team leads and coworkers, the overall pain of working retail is bearable. (All of my leads hate me because they each have their own priorities that conflict with one another, so nothing I do is good enough. I've talked to HR and nothing changed.) Working on the salesfloor is beyond demanding now—you're expected to take on what months ago was multiple jobs: backroom, merchandise flow, price change, and planogram team member duties on top of answering phone calls, walkie calls, inbound calls (those help stations that you have 30 seconds to clear before the store gets penalized), calls to collect stray (abandoned/returned merchandise) for your department, and calls for backup cashiers, all while giving excellent guest service and keeping your department zoned. It's a huge challenge, especially as nothing in my department stays in the correct shelf for long. If my leads recognized my hard work instead of thinking I'm a waste of payroll, I wouldn't be miserable"
good,"Daily start my day at 7 in the morning, go in get cart for stocking shelves, also rearrange the store durning the seasons, unload trucks. I have been here 21 years not making what I should be, I"
good,I worked at target for 2 months it was seasonal and they did not hire me to stay. The job was okay for the season. I was called in many days that I was not scheduled due to others not coming into work.
good,When I first started at target I actually enjoyed working there second job I’ve had that I had fun doing but after a while it became a hassle. Once I took a promotion that’s when they put so much on my plate
good,"Have unrealistic goals of team members to reach. Instead of being a leader and helping their team they tell you “you need to move faster” with only 2 hours left of your shift. It’s just a part time job to get some extra cash nothing  more. Did not last 4 months, the disrespect was off the charts."
good,"All management cared about was selling Target Red Cards (their credit card), if you did not sell enough cards, 2 per shift, you were looked down upon."
good,"As most jobs go, there are always good and bad days but at this job, I often had bad days. They often made me feel uncomfortable and they often insult you there. They would say “what’s taking so long for the picking” literally on my third day of working there. Most of the people that work there often do about 8-9 carts a day and I did 7 carts on my 3rd day. In my opinion, that’s pretty quick for me to literally know where anything is in the store. Also, the workers there often give you bad looks. I was trying to get a day off for a serious situation and they told me that I would lose my job if I took the day off. Mind you, I asked 2 weeks in advance. But don’t get me wrong, there was also good things about this job. The lunches were 45 mins which is great cuz most jobs givea 30 min lunch. And on holidays when the store was open, they used to cater with good food and even sometimes on regular days if you are lucky n the store."
good,"they r starting to be like amazon and put less and less value on the employee."
good,Target is known as a fun and amazing place to shop! However when working there the story is different. The management and some of the workers there had a click. The employees would favor certain people and it made the workplace not as fun as I thought it would be when I got hired!
good,I worked in the infant department or any other department if there was a call out. Some managers were great others who had favorites and would let the coworkers get away with things. Hours aren't a guarantee.  If you are a closer you have to finish everything the morning crew didn't finish and still finish the tasks they gave you for the night. Can't leave anything behind for the morning crew so these results on a late-night usually getting off at midnight. Hardly schedule enough cashiers so might be stuck doing that. It could be a stressful work environment depending on whos in charge. I absolutely loved my coworkers though.
good,"Your experience at Target will largely depend on who your immediate superiors are. If you are lucky enough to have understanding and efficient Team Leads, you will love the culture and experience at Target. However, the promotion of unqualified and poorly tempered employees has plagued Target’s store to store management with lack of communication, poor performance, unprofessional behavior, and multiple breaking of the law."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is interaction with customers and employees. Typical day at work consists of putting out new merchandise, answering phone calls and directing to correct department."
good,"Target will prepare for any fast paced intensive work environment."
good,"I have to have a flexible work schedule to work around child care. I will look for a better paying job when I can work full time with a set schedule. I would recommend this job to young kids as a first job, to those who need to work different times on different days or to supplement their income. When hours get cut I may get 5 hours in a week. I can work 40 but never get that."
good,"easy job, replace people for anything. management not all together. learned to just go to work and do my job. most enjoyable part was pay day of course."
good,"Ultimately a good place to work. However their new policies put to much work-load onto team members. There is no pay raises unless you consider 5 cents every year a just raise."
good,If I ever work for target again I would want to work Flow-team I believe that's me. the job was Flow-team and I was at work everyday and I worked until my shift was over. what I didn't like was they told me I wasn't moving fast enough for them to see me make it as a Target Team Member
good,"This job entails of stocking shelves with new products and selling computers, TV’S, with other products. It is not a hard job I thought I would have more learning in this environment. Only saw manager and supervisor maybe once or twice a week otherwise on my own. The pay is not great and not up with the times."
good,"Target has favorites"
good,I suggest this job because it pays well. but if you arent willing to work in the rain and hot sun I wouldn't suggest this job. managers often had me working in-store and out the store so I would go from being soaked by the rain to the cold a.c. also battling with keeping both sides of the store filled with carts was terrible.
good,I applied under the understanding that it was going to be full time but ended up being part time and seasonal and then dropped down to 3 hours/week. I used to call in for extra work or verbally ask before clocking out if they needed me but they didnt always choose me.
good,"Working with people school schedule better hours so people can provude for their families, better manger that dont think it all about them and everybody should be treated fairly"
good,"Was not fun to work here, when the new manager got hired if she had a problem woth anyone on their team she couls have them taken off their team and the hours were reduces by more than half."
good,"I was a stock boy for the holiday seasons and this job was very fast paced when unloading the truck but then once you get onto the floor everyone would have their own aisle, I was let go after the holiday season. Hardest part is the managment would base your work on how fast you work not how efficent you were."
good,"Was a good working/learning experience for me for a first time retail experience, however, since I was only hired on as a seasonal employee for the holidays I noticed myself and the other seasonal hires weren't treated as well/fairly as the full-time/part-time employees."
good,"As much as I loved this place in the beginning, they don't know how to schedule. Your hours will constantly bounce back and forth. You might have 40 hours one week and only 12 the next it's a scary time when you don't know if you can pay your bills."
good,"It's hard to get responses as well as giving them no matter how hard I try barely get a response for spills or assistance, makes it hard to work there."
good,"Brindar tranquilidad, respetar la curva de aprendizaje."
good,"I don’t think I’ll ever go back. I worked over night the ETLs abuses their power, very unprofessional & and too friendly. It was a lot of favoritism. Overall ehhh"
good,"I liked working here a lot, my hiring and front end managers are good people. unfortunately i had asked for my hours to be changed several times and it just didn't happen. that was my main reason for leaving. other than that Target was a cool place"
good,"The longer I work for Target, the more stressed I get. I've been with the company for 9 years and have moved up from a seasonally hired team member to a keyholder position in management. The company has been adding more and more duties and responsibilities over the years, but with the major operations model change they implemented earlier this year they've really stretched us way thinner than anyone should be. It's pretty telling when higher management is saying they expect most of the company's store leadership not to survive the op model change."
good,A typical work day for me consists of resetting planograms and keeping to store clean for guests. I learned how to read planogram reports and answer questions of other team members helping them all learn to do the job.
good,Working at target one can gain Shipping and backstoke skills as well as Sales and Merchandising. Co-workers can be fun and energetic. Full time status is a struggle to gain as well as decent hours per week will be difficult. Conditions may vary within Target.
good,"I worked for 2yrs dedicatedly. Then I broke my wrist and my hours got cut to 5-12/week and we were paid bi-weekly! This target is also a store for training great bosses and sending them to other stores, meanwhile all the lifeless lifers of the store stay behind. Management does NOT communicate with one another about anything."
good,"They pay well for a price. You're told that you get your own department but due to modernization you're forced to cover other shifts that haven't been scheduled so you spend a lot of time there instead. The people are nice but everyone is obviously over worked. In terms of retail, Target isn't bad but be prepared to work."
good,My experience was alright in general though the management didn’t care much about keeping employees happy when it comes to a work/life balance. I was often called on my days off to come in which wasn’t much of a problem when I had nothing going on but on days that I had plans they would make me feel guilty for not helping them out after someone else called in sick or didn’t show up.
good,"You definately get paid enough per hour if they keep your hours consistent. For some reason, our location could never keep hours stable, even for their long term employees, despite us being a relatively busy store. Benefits only if you can maintain a certain number of hours per week. Everyone's always on edge. Drama in management. Had a manager use slurs and then told me they could make my work life as difficult as they wanted.. Took months for them to even say anything about it."
good,"Target was an enjoyable company to work for overall, there were some downsides with management & not getting enough hours. That is why I had to move on."
good,The job pays decent but hours are very inconsistent. A lack of communication between leaders causes many issues. The location i work at seems to play favorites in terms of moving up in the company rather than experience.
good,"Fast paste, safety level below average, many injuries and accidents. Pays less than other similar jobs. Good benefits. Paid vacation. Long weekends available"
good,"Good company to work for but they ask a lot from one person, they are low on staff most of the time and expect you to do double or triple the work for them. They have a difficult time covering breaks for the reason that not all manages or leads are okay with their team covering breaks or lunch for another team. They do not explain your daily routine during the interview process people have quit due to the workload they have to complete on a day to day basis."
good,"Not bad as a first job. Worked here for a little while then moved on. Not somewhere I’d recommend if you want to move up in the company, the pick and choose favorites."
good,"When I first started working at Target, it was a great place to work. Everybody was friends with each other - even the LODs. I felt fulfilled and part of a team. I honestly can i say i looked forward to going into work."
good,It was an okay place to work at for seasonal. Very keep yourself busy type of job. I would recommend young people to deff apply there for after school pre college job.
good,Target recently rolled out their plan to pretty much make everything the employees fault and it's causing product work to get behind and cutting hours and making guest first but get in trouble for not finishing work while store is open and the management is just so oblivious about it and the store sales are really bad ever since they started the code of ethics for the employees which is basically a rip-off of the Amazon $15 Whole foods plan/warehouse.
good,I worked very well with the guest and interactions with customers. I also would go above and beyond to help a guest find and item in the store.  Making sure everything was organized and all online orders were processed. Was a great experience just needed better management
good,I would clock in very early at 6AM and go to the backroom where all of our inventory is kept in bulk pallets and shelves. I would unload freight a trailer-truck for most of my shift and then stock on the sales floor for an hour or so until the end of my shift.
good,My problem with working with Target is that we are so short staffed because they are very picky on who they interview let alone hire and they just fire people that we needed which makes other employees leave on their own. Whoever is left now has to carry departments on their shoulders with little help and management keeps pushing more work only giving you a hand when you snap.
good,Management did not compensate for the amount of work expected of you.  They were not upfront of the changes forthcoming within the company.  Constantly lied to employees and cut hours unexpectedly even when support was necessary.
good,"April is ""layoff"" time for IT and most of Management to show profits to investors. So, if you are lucky enough to make it to see summer, you are golden and able to see ""Peak Season"" in the Fall. "
good,"Target used.to be fast fun and friendly now with reduced hours and micro managed leadership it is no longer a fun place to work. The turn over rate at my store is around 300% Our upper management has unrealistic expectations. They do pay well, but at some point money is just not enough."
good,"At first, I was very excited to work at Target, it had always been my dream job. After the holiday season, there were no hours for anyone, including myself, so I had to find other ways to make ends meet. They would often schedule me over my max number of hours that I could work (minor hours) and out of my availability. Overall, Target was decent."
good,"Towards the end of my time with Target, we were losing a lot of our management people due to the company restructuring their management of the stores. The hard part was that new employees would come in and get offered almost as much as I was making with 3 years of experience."
good,"I worked on the early morning, and I would not recommend it. The pay is terrible, there are no benefits, and a lot of the people Target hires are lazy."
good,The company is  great to work for as long as you don't have a voice . The hardest part of my job us just feeling under appreciated and at time job security.
good,management sucks they let all the power go to there heads. would even expect me to zone almost 42 aisles in 30-45 minutes by myself or you'd be fired. they expected to much out of one employee.
good,"I feel like Target as a “team” attacks you. I feel like everything you do, is not appreciated or noticed. Once you’re on “final” they throw it in your face when you have an emergency."
good,I’ve learned in my years with this company that whoever runs the store dictates if it’s enjoyable or not. Corporate has their green money hands around all of managements throats and one wrong word or step and you’re labeled “PROBLEM”. The hours are basically whatever is given to you except during the holiday when you’re chained by the ankle and run down until you can’t anymore.
good,"It’s like high school working there, you have to be “friends” with management to get a promotion. They give the people they like better hours than the people that actually work hard, you can easily acquire more hours through KRONOS. They changed things a lot there, training is awful... show up and be friendly you’ll be fine"
good,"If you're looking for a quick paycheck and an easy job then Target is the right place to be.  Fast pace and quick problem solving is a plus so if you're up for the challenge, then this is the place to be."
good,Working at Target is good for the fast paced worker. Working at Target was difficult when it came to communication due to a lack there of managers for night crew.
good,Not enough hours or pay to support someone living on their own.  Had to pick up hours from others who were giving up shifts in order to make it to 40 hours.
good,"I only just started working at Target and there was immediately issues with my availability and scheduling. "
good,"If you are simply a team member, the workload may seem unfair, the expectations will be out of proportion and forever changing. If you are in management you have the opportunity to be better, make more money and shape the team the way you want. The issue is usually unrealistic expectations, poor HR and poor Store directors but the team leaders/managers all share a common duty and feeling towards the job. If you can land a job at a more organized target all of these issues will be lessened. Only thing is...you don't know which one is organized or not until you work there."
good,Enjoyed my co workers. But management were tough on employees when they called out even if it was an emergency.i called out once and this manager on duty was literally forcing me to go and do hours scheduled when i was clearly telling him.i wasnt going to make it.he was still setting a time.for me to go in and questioning that my emergency wasnt an emergency.you cant leave unless your section and fitting room is clear from merchandise ecen if your scheduled to leave at a certain time in the evening. Sometimes if you finished before others you will be sent to help others section.
good,"Target gives a really good amount of hours to all of their employees. However they are not very considerate as they would always schedule me when I was in class. I’ve had to call off many weeks in a row saying I couldn’t work certain hours due to me being in class. But they just ignored me and acted like I never said anything. If you’re going to school I wouldn’t recommend working here, but if you don’t have any obligations then this wouldn’t be a bad job as you would get a lot of hours and make a good amount of money."
good,"Target was ok to work for. It could have been better I suppose. A lot of the time the management would stand around or walk around and that was about it, there was one manager that was there before that actually helped out with the work like she was supposed to, but she doesn't work their anymore. Most of the employees who have been there awhile don't interact with anybody new, especially the freight team, they are all super rude and think they are better than anybody else."
good,"They care about the employees, but not enough hours and no real benefits without working there for years and years.  Not a lot of job advancement either within the company"
good,Target is a place for people who do not have a lot of responsibility the schedule is all over the place.  Expect way too much for a little bit of money. So I had to let Target go I couldn't work there anymore. The hiring manager was very nice. Co-workers  was cool. Overall my experience was okay.
good,"For me personally i hate that we arent given hours . I get around 25 ish maybe 30, but only the few favorites get the 40. Technically everyone is part time. Its good pay dont get me wrong (13$) but its also too much work pilled on top of you with only roughly 4 hours to do it. The managers are too by the book and the papers and dont really understand that no human can do 6 hrs of work in 4 hrs. You also dont get a discount on anything unless you use cash or have a target red card. Red cards with be the death of target employees."
good,"This work environment for the most part was relaxed, but the one aspect of it that affected me the most was how I worked alone majority of my shifts. I do understand that budget cuts are common in corporations, but it affects the quality of service and work when there are few employees to execute certain tasks. Cleanliness was important, and most of the time it was difficult to properly follow cleaning procedures when there were not enough team members to finish all the task. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with. The hardest part of the job was working with a team member that did not put in the same amount of effort as I did. Even after informing a manager or team lead multiple times on how one particular team member kept messing up, there were no disciplinary actions taken. They may have pulled them to the side a few times, but it got to the point where it was a common issue with this team member, yet they still ended up working there for as long as I did. This made me feel like they were keeping this team member just so they wouldn't be short-staffed, but it didn't help because it affected the work flow."
good,"They expect Guest Service employees to now hang up and fold Softlines.... I mean ""Styles"" clothes, while sort reshop all day (if you don't it will piled up quick ESPECIALLY STYLES CLOTHING), while taking guest, and answering the phone. Sometimes there  is literally only one person there for hours and guest complain after a while when its taking too long or not a lot of people to help because people call out or they don't schedule a lot of people. Also, they call last minute when hours are available. I also have a conflict with a co-worker who put a false complaint about me out and defame my character, which can get them fired and they have done it to MULTIPLE people, they don't do anything about it..EVEN when managers know they do it and its apart of the guidelines that it IS NOT TOLERATED!!!!!!"
good,"Target was a great first job to work at as a teenager, but as things got more expensive and bills needed to start being paid, the low income was not enough."
good,Management is horrible! That’s really what runs the store down. They promote people who really have no idea what they are doing and expect the people who actually know what is going on to coddle the ones who don’t
good,"Overall target was pretty good to me, most of the leads do recognize you for the work that you do, but management does not do much work. Typically they like to sit back and watch you do all the work."
good,"It is a good place to work but theres favorites and people who get away with doing nothing. the good ones get pooped on all the time. they use you until you dont let them any more, then either promote you or let you leave."
good,not the best retail but a very good experience working there and being invoked in customer service and just working at different methods of all the positions they have to offer.
good,"target wasnt a terrible place to work at. i got along with all the people and i was able to sell the most redcards. however, i was in a terrible car accident back in 2013 and my manager had lost my doctors note excusing me from work since i had a concussion and wrote down those days as a no call no show."
good,"If you're looking for a career, don't look here."
good,"I worked for marketsource(target) for 7 months. I received a check once a week, and every single check was incorrect. The commisions structure changed weekly, and the upper management didnt care about the employees. They never addressed or fixed the problem. The target employees and management them selves were extremely lind, but market sources hold on the mobile center was disgusting. Good riddance"
good,"Target is a fast paced retail establishment. You are paid well enough but expect to earn every penny.Houra are hard to come by unless you are in specific jobs, and there are no extranious leadership roles which means its hard to get promoted."
good,Worked long days with a lot to get done with little time for everything. There is no advancement unless you try for a team lead position which is currently all filled for my department.
good,"The upper management here only cares about getting people to sign up for Redcards, and care very little if someone's guest service is poor if they get enough of those credit card sign ups. They're also bad about getting sick hours paid out."
good,"It sucks when you've been there 6 plus yrs and a new person make the same pay you do. They can hours down to bare bones and expect the same amount of work to get do in,less time."
good,"Working for target over a year has just gone down hill. The management is completely terrible. I loved it until recently when they started handing out write ups for no reason. I had to fight a lot of them because they were inconsistent and not handled properly. The LODs make you feel uncomfortable and feel like they are threatening you. I’ve gone to my LOD about situations and she made me feel like I was in the wrong. I get nothing but attitude from her. The store leader is the same. He tried punishing me for arriving early as I do all the time. He threatened to make me late. He doesn’t want us calling the hot line because it will make him look bad. They wrote up one of my coworkers for her pants being two defining and my gstl told me I couldn’t wear any of the shirts that I’ve been wearing since I’ve started because my breast are defining. All of the higher ups are best friends so it’s hard to talk to any of them because they will go tell the other one and then they all punish you in some kind of way. My coworkers have become a second family and it’s the only reason we stay but seeing as it’s not getting any better, most of us are leaving."
good,The people you work with can make all the difference from a good job to a bad job. i used to absolutely love my job but under new management they have really sucked the life out of the store(2258).
good,Working for target is not reliable when it comes to hours. So I want to find something better. I Feel All The Hard Work I Put In I Should Have gotten more hours.
good,"management is musical chairs. i have 8 bosses and don't know who is over what. they can also can get cliquey and make the whole store toxic, it sucks a lot. we often have to beg for hours, everyone's are getting cut because we're going up to $15/hr. "
good,"Overall, it was a pleasure but being a cart attendant, you can only be stretched so thin. Did not feel like I was being compensated enough for the work my job entails."
good,"I've learned while working here that you should never believe management when they promise you anything. They never come through with anything they tell you. "
good,"Terrible management. More worried about looking cool and speaking to fellow higher ups all day than to show affability to the newbies. I was grateful for the few checks I got there for being in a jam, but my location showed me absolutely nothing about being a good worker there or advancing. I felt defeated everyday I left a shift. Avoid this one at least."
good,Flexible schedule is a plus. You tell them your availability and they will schedule you according to that. You get a couple pennies as your raise for your hard work. Management isn’t always the best that’s why they lose the hard workers.
good,"i enjoyed my time at that store, unfortunately after i had trained multiple people i was left in the air after assisting in numerous departments and projects, i'm a very a go for it person."
good,"Management can be toxic, not enough hours to give. The only people who are full time are managers.   Average hours Per week is eight. Always helping guess so need to find away to mange your time."
good,Target Pharmacy is now CVS in target and hence this review does not really reflect the current state of the management and structure of the pharmacy chain.
good,Working independently. Pulling U boats from the back room and restocking items on empty shelves. Helpimg customers find what they need and ask if they were finding everything okay or if they need any help.
good,"I've had many years of steady employment at Target, managing a work/life balance.  Target used to be a fun environment until recently due to the upcoming company-wide restructuring.  Wonderful coworkers that have become lifelong friends.  Perfect job as a second job, or a primary job for a high school student or one home from college for summer break.  Would not recommend for someone who needs this job as primary income to support a family as hours are inconsistent and not guaranteed."
good,"Working at Target was one of the worst jobs I've had. I went out of town the day before I had a 8 hour shift but I was going back home the same day. But I ended up going to the ER due to a sereve pain I had in my chest. I was unable to call out because I spent hours in the ER. My shift started at 2pm so I called right when they opened. I was transferred to one of the supervisors and was very rude to me. This is how the conversation went:"
good,"At first it was fun to work there but as time went on it became to stressful. The management had their favorites and they ran the show."
good,"I have fixed feelings about my time here. Every day was different, a perfectly calm day and smooth day could end up really nasty as you get yelled at by a customer for no reason."
good,I was a minor age 17. I applied to work during the summer and i didn’t get in until a week before school began but the whole point of applying in summer was to have a summer job. Once I worked there I realized that I was barely getting any hours in about 3 minimum and 8 max WEEKLY. My checks were usually around $90 mind you we were paid biweekly so I would barely make anything. I was constantly asking for more hours but never received any so I ended up quitting.
good,"LOVED the people that worked here, they were great, just hated that management didn't want you to have a life outside of work. They would get mad if you didn't want to stay past your scheduled work time, nor did they like it when you had to change your schedule around. I was told pick either work or school."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, and I enjoyed my guests at every Target store I worked at.  Working at Target was fun, everyone helped each other out.  The worst part of working at Target though is the low pay, and the unsteady hours.  If Target paid a better wage and guaranteed 40 hours a week without relying on call outs or having to work your days off in a pinch for hours; then Target would be the best job!  Upper management on the executive and corporate level make terrible business decisions and cause a lot of problems for the Target community."
good,I have no more to say about it .. it was a ok experience I received knowledge on how to serve the customer more efficiently and make people feel comfortable as possible
good,It started off great I enjoyed what I did but not who i worked for. My first boss was horribly hostile and never helped or answered questions then complained if you had to stop setting an isle to use the bathroom. When departments were restructured I was happy where they put me until i met the department manager and she would sit on her butt doing nothing but text then complain because the three of us couldnt do the job of 12 people and the store manger would scream at us and ask why nothing gets done. We started off behind and never caught up they never gave us what was structured for pay wise in the department. we were given a budget to pay 12 employees to work our department and they only had 4 of us.
good,"relaxed, easy to do, good part time job "
good,"A great company for women and very inclusive culture, however very demanding and unfair compensation for the tremendous workload! Initially I was very happy but the many changes to policy over the years made it tough to work after 20 years it was time to go!"
good,"Target helped me grow as a person; not just career wise. The management tends to be laid back and relatable. The company strives to be the best, and maintain brand. Negatively though, there is just something different about target. The pressure is on, there is never enough hours, you are always asked to do more with less, and the recognition is never given lightly."
good,"Not really any advancement opportunities, would love to stay with the company and promote within but leadership is not helpful. Hourly pay is great if you are a student or looking for a part time job. Wouldn't recommend it if you need to support a family. Health insurance is not available for 13 months"
good,"I started as a seasonal employee and was chosen to join the team as a part time employee. In the beginning it was great! Everyone was nice and relaxed. Once I was hired as a part time employee, my hours were cut to about 12 hours a week and the management team was horrible! They expected the most from employees and would give so many tasks that even the managers wouldn’t be able to finish in one night. They have ALOT of favoritism. They do not care what you might have going on outside of work that might hinder you from coming in that day. They will keep you there till 3am and most people have to be awake for 6am for their full time job! At night we would do the jobs of morning crew and be expected to make morning crew easier but they get to leave regardless of the way the store looks. Any other target I would try but I wouldn’t recommend Dallas South Target to anyone."
good,"I worked at Target during a seasonal time and the job itself was okay. The store was fairly slow paced though, so I often struggled to find something to do for the entirely of my shift."
good,"This job could've been a good job. The potential was there however, the management was so poor that it caused tensions between shift managers who would fight over the sales associates to use them in their departments to make them look better."
good,"upper management usually comes straight from college with a degree in hand but has no actual experience in what is customer service . no idea of what its like to work any area of the store but still in the position to  make decisions on store policy. The regular employees end up training them."
good,Started well but over time has gotten worse lot of ups and down hours sometimes all over the place really depends on the work center you are in if u will enjoy it or not
good,"When I tried to get Sunday off one of the managers told me that the company needs me to work at least four hours, and I couldn’t do that because I was going to college at the time and needed that day off."
good,"The core issue is the management style and or tools in use. While I recognise the drive and commitment that many of the managers bring they are often led to poor managerial choices. "
good,Great customers & coworkers. 1 awful manager. No benefits for 2 years. Manager actually rudely grabbed merchandise from me. He also deliberately prevented some of my training.
good,"It's better than working at Wal Mart, but not by much. I enjoyed my coworkers and the job itself wasn't bad. The 'management' were mostly inexperienced kids right out of college who had no clue. Some of the people in authority positions were frankly incompetent. It's a job, just don't expect more than that."
good,"This store is mostly for young kids/adults coming out of high school or looking for a job as a stepping stone. Not long term, No opportunities, too much favoritism, bad ones get good hours and the one who speak their minds and are hard working get nothing for their Great Efforts!"
good,"I enjoyed some of  my coworkers work, other could’ve been better on the other hand. All managers don’t work they walk around. One does work and loves her team memebers"
good,In the beginning it was great but then management jumped down our throats about the red card and other promotions and forgot about customer service this is why gamestop is doing so poorly
good,"Management makes the work environment poor and unprofessional, really enjoyed my co workers and besides the obvious rude guest, it was an experience of growth and knowledge."
good,"I have been working a Target for 4 months and already feel it is time to part. Availability has always been to have two days during the week off because I am at school those days. I spoke about this during my interview several times and have made availability requests that show this and was approved AND YET I am STILL being scheduled on those days. This results in me having to track down my TL (hopefully they are even there) and explain once more out of countless times that I can not work those days. After I am able to notify them we go over the schedule and because it is after the schedule is posted I lose hours! Honestly, no wonder my store has a high turnaround rate."
good,Hopefully the corporation is doing more for their employees unlike when I worked there. The good part of it although is the discount the shopping and the customers.
good,"Retail just isn't for those that are below the store manager position AND have a family. Hours are long, weekends are nonexistent. Never enough hours for team members to complete the task at hand. I've had to work a trash compactor at 7 months pregnant. I've also had to pick up employees in a snow storm while 7 months pregnant because metro system was closed, and Target refused to close. No consideration for the well being of employees."
good,"Pay and raises were pitiful. I left there after working there for about 3 years and made less than what my starting salary was at heb. Management is not helpful, not a lot of promoting from within."
good,The management team at the Target I work at is very inconsistent. Some managers are very helpful towards their employees while some just simply walk away when they don't know how to fix an issue. Certain head supervisors were extremely rude and was known for being rude and in the past has made employees cry.
good,"I do my job as a cashier or guest service most of the time. But end up doing my bosses job as they tell me to stop screwing around, even though not doing that and they go back to doing just that."
good,"They should be more specific if the job is seasonal or not. I wasn't aware that my time was up until I made a phone call asking about my schedule. Also they need to work on who they have training people at target. May things I had to learn on my own, which is not a problem. However, those problems could have been avoided of taught properly."
good,If you didnt work enough hours tries to be friends with everyone to some of the managers working there you did not get favored there. They didn't like to work with there employes schedule.
good,"With my experience Target doesn't really care about your well-being "
good,"Good for a quick temporary job. Flexible scheduling. Energetic to teach you and help you learn more about getting involved in your position. Wouldn't recommend long-term stay, no room for career growth."
good,"No sincerity. Management is extremely fake. More for less. All employees get paid the same regardless of individual production. Fast, Fun, and Friendly is a term of the past."
good,"Who don't want to work for Target right? well once you get on with target you start to find out its NOT the place you always wanted to work at. You hardly get hours for work, very unorganized, very very rude employees."
good,"They paid more to people who did nothing , the main manager was the best but human resources don't care about you. They're all friends so if one doesn't like you then none of them do. too much gossip."
good,"a typical day at work is unloding the truck, moving pallets to their areas of the floor."
good,"Friendly orendted. Face peace. If not checking your stocking or cleaning......................"
good,"Stock as much product u can to satisfy a customer. Make sure my allie is nice a neat."
good,"If you so much as take one day per week and say you are unavailable for education purposes, then they cut your hours in half. If you're sick and try to call out ahead of time, they will still call you at home and ask if you're sure you can't come in. For what the job entailed, it was relatively low stress."
good,"Benefits were good, pay not so much. Upper management didn't really have a sense of trust and never felt empowered to make decisions. Manager had a my way or the highway approach and would find a reason to write you up if you didn't agree with decisions. No matter how hard you worked, it was never good enough."
good,"Working for Target was okay for a first real job, they just need to up their staffing. The managers were kind of rude but nothing to bad. Honestly, not a horrible place to work."
good,If you are a super hard worker and dont mind being belittled and walked all over its great otherwise i would not advise it. Their is no teamwork between the managers. And it causes animosity betwewn co workers.
good,"The pay was good compared to many retail jobs in the area, most employees were friendly. Not enough help on the floor and a high expectation from managers. Most managers were friendly."
good,Management tends to be in decisive as well as incompetent. The leadership does not understand what they are doing in majority of roles. The salary is also not great for the amount of work they task workers with.
good,"Fun to work with when you have friends, try to learn as many things that you can while your there you will get more hours, and have fun while working but be productive."
good,Treats baristas different and wouldn't let me move to any other department also gets paid less than everyone that starts out at regular target. No free drinks and no tips
good,"The job itself was pretty boring but did not expect anything different, really. But they wanted everyone to work fast but not effeciently. They really had a bit of an us against them attitude between management and associates. Not a very nice place to work. It was a second job to make more money and became not worth it to stay."
good,"Target Co. talks a good game, acts like it is so benevolent. They have various tactics to try to convince the workers that they are a great place to work. They have some food days where they give you lunch and they talk about teamwork but really when it comes down to it it is too much work for too few people in too little of a time. They expect 1 person to do 3 peoples worth of work in 3 hours when it would take 6 with all 3 people."
good,"Target is your typical job after high school while you are trying to figure out what you want to do in life, I was available full-time for them but you have to watch your time clock and its on you to watch it, if you go over 40 hours you will be in trouble and even if they ask you to work more you have to tell them that your already at hours then they decided if they will approve it, they normally only approve it around the holiday."
good,While you can have a job at Target the environment and structure makes it very difficult if not impossible to move up within the company. The Target structure is changing and taking away even more management positions now.
good,"I loved working at Target. I had issues with another worker and soon came to realize that if she didn't like you she would try to get you fired. This woman gets paid for doing NOTHING on her shifts. She would talk on her cell phone, and never pick up anything to do any work. The bosses praised her and our Team Leader was friends with her outside of work so instead of telling her to do her job, they would pass the work off to me or someone else who was new so they could chat on the side. I had gone to management MANY times and they did not care to do anything for us workers who did too much work for too little pay."
good,"It is it’s ups and down, but overall it’s a good job for young people. It’s not a career choice in my opinion. Management wasn’t the best and to my liking. Did so much and did not get anything in return."
good,Personally the entire staff seemed upset with how management dealt with schedules and other issues. It became an unhealthy work environment due to the sour attitudes.
good,"most the mangers do not like when a team members tell them that their crew members didn't do their job right. dosen't matter how hard or how fast you work, if your not buddy buddy with your bosses they'll find a reason to let you go."
good,"Not a lifelong career. Hours are always up and down, management is a joke. Loyal workers get taken advantage of and never get what they are promised.."
good,The target I worked at was mismanaged and employee's were treated with the thought that no one mattered. They did offer frequent employee parties and a few of the managers strove to provide a great environment but were often over shadowed by a less than energized. The employees though that worked their provided an outstanding atmosphere.
good,Company is slow I like fast paced they will cut hours down to 10 hours a week the company gives no overtime and there are no full time workers unless you are in management
good,This company loves and primarily hires from within and can be crypling in doing so. I was hired by referal from an employee which whom I hired. Considered to be outsider. Not treated fairly and even with a degree others which did not have a degree where advanced simply because they where a cashier 3 months prior to my hire in the Human resourse department .
good,It was okay the 1st two years with the promises of promotions. Going on 3 years working hard to move up only to get the short end of the stick cause you start a family and go on paid leave. When  you come back they shorten your hours promotion out the door. So you take an LOA come back to no job transfer to another location only to get there and same thing. Wanted me to work hard for the same pay no raise after being there 4 years.  So you give them a week notice only for them to classify you as non rehire able. Would love to be able to go back.
good,new management made the company not a good working environment. loss of hours and days. pay was not up to what it was when I started the company. kept switching places for me to work
good,"Nothing is particularly difficult, it just depends on whether or not you know how and have been trained correctly.  Poor leadership that will lie to your face, the only thing that they care about is self promotion."
good,A normal day would consist of organizing the area and helping guest and of course pushing sales. Until we got a new electronics manager  we were doing well. Then that manager tried implementing new things that did not work and hours were cut for everyone drastically. When I left our group rank dropped to last. my friend who still works there told me they are still at the lowest rank and the electronics department is a mess.
good,"learning where products go, very time you when in for a shift as product moved all the time.  trying to fit in with permanent staff as a christmas casual."
good,there is no typical day at target. everyday there are new projects and new things to do. there is constant reshot but that is just anywhere you will work with retail. there however is not room for moving up in the company and no benefits.
good,"Since the remodel, management has forgone treating team members fairly. They’ve cut hours, and expect us to work harder in order to get everything done as a result. The amount of work stayed consistent, and yet we cut hours down. They still expect everything to be done as it was before (we could barely manage to complete the daily tasks before all this)."
good,"Decent pay, decent location, the commute is decent. I have a few co-worker friends that I made, outside of the HR department the team is not very understanding of stress and the amount of follow up appointments needed to schedule in relation to the residual effects of being hospitalized. "
good,"Management was impressed with the items I had sold, so as long as you work, they will keep you around. Although, it most certainly feels like the employees who work less are praised more than the ones that actually work. The pay was not enough to keep me there for long because I needed a career and stability. There were only a few coworkers there I enjoyed working with that made Target bearable. There was always work to do to keep you busy and make time fly."
good,A typical day at work is pretty much the same everyday. The management team is very disorganized and day to day tasks seem very rushed. The workplace culture is acceptable however its not particularly special. I have not learned much that I didn't already know
good,"Working at target had its ups and downs. don’t get me wrong .. it wasn’t AWFUL, but i wasn’t getting paid enough to deal with some of that management staff. A normal day consisted of constantly getting called to the front for cashier assistance, running back and forth as managers demand you do everything, and your supervisors mixing up all the lunch breaks. I think my biggest pet peeve is that they never have enough people working the cash registers and other sales floor associates are constantly forced to go help. Wasn’t my cup of tea, but some people love retail! haha"
good,I've found a retail job is just like every other retail job.   You should arrive 15 minutes early and do what is expected.  With this particular job I'd transfere departments every 2 years to try to break the monotony.  I started with the night shift pulling items from the backroom and ended working mornings doing produce.  The management came and went either meaning they transfered to other stores or quit because they discovered they hated doing retail.  When first starting this job I was told to greet customers with a smile and try to make sales.  I personally am a friendly person who says hello to others and helps anyone in need of help with profit having nothing to do with it.   What I enjoyed about this job was starting knowing that I would be able to pay my bills.  The worst was still seeing that large corporations only focus on making a profit.
good,"nice place to work if you like large teams, but the hours are not good.  Salaried are expected to deliver great results and when you are not you own all the processes"
good,"Staff is very nice "
good,"Working at target used to be a fun experience, but as of a few months ago it’s gotten unbearable to work for. The sales floor team members are amazing, and even the team leads, but the higher ups (ETL) was really are to work for due to negativity and no constructive criticism."
good,Coworkers were great. Made some good friends. Supervisors sucked. Can have visible tattoos. Not enough hours to support yourself unless your are a team lead. Great for students tho
good,"changes have left my store short on people and hours, but not stunting the changes of systems. we are testers of new half implemented systems that we dont have the time to fully omplement on top of already being behind on expected work. work areas have been dived up now and not all in those sections can or at least have been finishing their work. which causes at least the back of the store to fall behind and be a dumping ground for everything. unfinished tasks pile up and continue for further set things behind."
good,"Target provides a stable source of competitive income for those who are willing to endure its workplace. With frequent shift changes, a confusing and bickering hierarchy of supervisors, and a collection of lackluster and typical retail positions. Team culture and workloads vary greatly between individual teams and team leaders but, under the best circumstances, can be a serious positive of a position with this company in a regular store. However, the company distinguishes itself from its competitors (especially on the side of logistics) in sometimes the most bizarre and inefficient methods possible, which translates into frequent stress as even daily tasks are performed."
good,"A lot of walking, and lifting "
good,"Just a hard place to work , Expect a lot from people with little in return. They often cut hours and make it so working there just isn't worth it. Management very self involved"
good,"Just need a change in the work field , need a job where my hours can stay the same and I only want to work 32 hours a week the deli part is wonderful great team and a great leader"
good,"Target was fine, I got on as seasonal and left as seasonal, they claimed they didn't have any permanent positions but ok. I wouldn't go back nor recommend the job."
good,There’s a lot of people who work there. Some of the management is questionable. Overall a good place to work. Cuts hours a lot to watch out for that. Nice first job.
good,Great hourly pay for retail but not enough hours given to employees. Great place to work for someone without kids or to many bills. Can't count on getting 40 hours each week.
good,"The Coorporation is huge with so many employees. So, they don't really care about staff turnover. People stream in and out of the door on weekly basis as they can't manage the stress at work."
good,"Most management is under 30 barely out of college, doesn't actually know what's going on in their store and doesn't care to learn. Only time anything gets done is around a DTL visit. Most employees just show up so they don't get fired, minimal work gets done."
good,The job is pretty easy it is just the simple fact that the pay does not allow for an adult to live off of it.Target is part time all across the board. No position is full-time.The only time you will see any money or hours is around Christmas.
good,Stocking job was simple and easy. We would start from one end of the store and finish at the other end. The thing I enjoyed the most was setting and stocking Christmas stuff. Just seeing all the people rush threw the sections to see what they could get first. Overall it was a good job the only thing was that i was only seasonal.
good,They work us to hard for what they trying to pay us. And now they going to take are overnight shift away. So i'm stuck i don't know what i'm going to do now.
good,"so many good things about target, but top level management encourages dehumanizing and lack of compassion.  constantly increasing pressure to perform without increasing pay for managers.  the crux of the workload falls on the team leads who are not paid enough and always under extreme pressure."
good,"Never get full time and when you go over 35 hours they will send you home just to make sure you don't get overtime, but for a first job they gave me a chance it's hard to find a job with no experience. They gave me that at least"
good,mainly its not bad if its well staffed. issue is its not. typical day at work consist of a lot of customer service cleaning and making drinks. you learn a lot about coffee and get to try out learn a lot about starbucks.
good,Target is a great place to start for highschool student's or someone who is starting to get into the work world. The pay is minimum wage with some increase but don't expect to see job growth.
good,"I do not feel this is a bad place to work, however, there should certainly be an increase in staff. The amount of work in the minimum time allowed isn't worth the pay.More employees will allow for better focus on required tasks for individuals."
good,"i started on the overnight shift because that is what worked for me at the time, two weeks later i was informed that they were changing us to early morning instead, not a huge problem but i felt like they withheld that information during my hiring process purposely. The People working there were great i found myself excited to come in because i had made actual connections. Customers left a lot to be desired."
good,"I didn’t exactly like my time as a tartget team memeber, I hated the hours I would constantly get called on my free days to work like 3 hours in the midddle of the day and the management was terrible he never even bothered to remember my name"
good,its an ok place to work they changed managment and our team began to fall apart. Wont be hanging around to long just looking for a replacement so that I can move on.  to many hour cuts
good,"Target is fine for a first time job, but that is it. Only way to advance is to drop out school/be available full time and then some. Management is either really good or really bad. I had an excellent STL, but she left and the three after here were in over their heads. Lack of communication through all departments."
good,"Very busy as an cashier, meeting a lot of new people all the time, helping where ever needed, giving directions to items for the customers, helping on the floor where ever needed."
good,"The culture here is very unique.  If you don't fit the mold, it becomes increasingly difficult to fake.  Compliance and uniformity in this culture is applauded.  Ask too many questions or inquire about certain issues and you become public enemy #1."
good,"The hardest part of working at target is starting off. I was lucky to have worked at a Starbucks before working at target but when you first start you're thrown into it. Training is done by other baristas, there is no training period. Management can be confusing if you're not used to having around ten managers to talk to. Counteractive tasks can be given to you by multiple managers at once."
good,"The base pay at Target is excellent and if you're just part-time or looking for a second job, they are flexible with hours. If you're full time, the hours can be insufferable. I moved up pretty quickly from cashier to supervisor but the pay didn't compensate for the increase in responsibility and there probably is no going higher for me with this company. Management can be cliquey and unhelpful (and of course this differs from store to store, people everywhere are different!) and it makes my job a lot harder than it needs to be. The hardest parts of my job are the hours, being on my feet all day (FitBit says between 13k and 18k steps a shift!), and not feeling like I'm being paid what I'm worth. The best part is my coworkers; we're called team members at Target and most days we really do operate as a team."
good,I would have to clean the bathrooms every hour. I would push carts into the store during the day. Help customers with large items. I would clean up spills and take out recycling. The culture had people who made the store or the business their life and that was not my mindset. They were also very into getting people to sign up for the target credit card which I know somehow improved the bottom line. I had a manager at the time who was too aggressive and we did not get along. The hardest part of the job was dealing with said manager. The easiest part of my job was dealing with a coworker who was my friend.
good,was a great team place to work i loved my team in the work place just didn't agree with the way they don't compensate for being pregnant and still working over time shifts
good,"Fast Pace your hold shift ,from unloading trucks to moving product to floor and onto shelf. lead and manager pulling agents in different direction not communicating with each other"
good,Big box retail with hard working team members. Long holiday hours are expected with little exceptions.  Depends on hard work of a few while others in management do not put forth any effort.
good,If you want to cross train you can't. they post jobs on the bulletin board and if you apply they don't contact you. Human resource dept is a joke. The people I worked with are great. There is no reason for scheduling and the words they use is availability. people leave because of this. and because of sales the previous year at the same time is how many hours you get this year. many shifts are understaff and this leads to products not on the shelf. Very frustrating to us and the guests.
good,"Not good Management as far as Team Leaders."
good,"I enjoyed my seasonal position there in soft-lines but disappointed to be let go."
good,"Management doesn't have the ability to fairly coordinate hours. Men are often given more hours. "
good,They don't care about you. It's all about profit and management looking good. They hire kids as executives who have no idea what they're doing..........
good,Target majes to much money to pay the way they do there managers be way younger then the people working there lunch hours are way to short they say u full time but give u part time hours
good,Working at Target has been like night and day.  Some managers are terrible.  They demand too much from team members. Heavy workloads in market with few workers.
good,"It is a great place to work when you are in your teens, not so much when you are an adult and trying to support a family. However it was fun place to work for."
good,"Going into the job everyday not sure what you’re going to be doing is stressful. They also have Whats called “Expectation”, where no matter what your scheduled, you’re expected to be able to stay 8 hours. So you could come in expecting to get off at 10, but then have to excuse your plans for them."
good,"Target loves to recruit fresh college graduates.  This works well for their bottom line, as the pay expectations are low.  I enjoyed learning so much about managing teams and working with peers to accomplish goals.  I was able to transfer to a store in another state when I needed to move closer to family.  The difficult part of this job comes from the expectation that every single employee project a positive, upbeat, bubbly attitude that Target calls ""Fast, Fun and Friendly.""  If you are normally a more introverted, thoughtful individual, you will not fit in.  The ranks of young, cut-throat managers will do whatever it takes to get ahead and district management seeks out not the most talented but those who are best at selling themselves as great managers.  This is a job that will teach you a ton, while turning idealistic individuals cynical towards the idea that hard work will pay off.  Be prepared to work harder than you ever have, learn important lessons about business and leadership, and then exit to a much better job when the time comes.  Unless you are great at self-promotion, networking, and impressing just the right people.  Target is the perfect fit for you."
good,If you're not fake and happy every minute you're there they will twist your every move into a negative and threaten your job. They preach about culture but that's what costs then good people.
good,"Grave yard shift is not Great and only 4 to 5 hours a day. work on Christmas and new year, Fast passed and a lot of lifting For little pay. Good Starter Job but not a Great long term job"
good,"A typical day of work consisted of back stocking items that weren't needed in the store floor, and pulling items that needed to be pushed to the store floor. It also included interacting with customers, coworkers and management very often. "
good,As a front line position in Target you are required to sell red Cards if you don't it makes you look bad. They keep track of how many red cards you sell so don't try lying about it
good,"To put it simple the management does not communicate with each other, let alone the team members. You will not have a clear goal day to day, you will feel like  you did not accomplish anything, and the overall job is just clunky and bulky. Expect to spend alot of time figuring out how to use outdated inventory systems and work equipment. The overall morale is pretty bad at least at the store I work at with even high end management my first week telling me to stop caring so much, it wont matter anyways."
good,"For the most part, It was a nice place to work. Information within the different parts of the store were kept close within said parts. Communication was lacking if they didn't like you."
good,It was a blessing working there. But all of the managers and everyone are college friends and they smile in your face but talk about you behind your back.
good,"Typical work days involved a set series of tasks to be completed before the shift ended. I learned customer management more than anything. Management itself was a huge range of great to terrible. The culture itself is do more but with less time. Hardest part was the increase of responsibilities yet no incentive, benefit or acknowledgment of the increased workload, or opportunities for advancement. The most enjoyable part was being in charge of my own section, and working with some people I became friends with."
good,"unload truck, sort merchandise and distributed in the proper alley within a 8 hour period. load of truck was more that the number of people who could handle."
good,"The work at Target can get stressful and strenuous. Mostly, you clean isles and push product out onto the floor. All in all relatively simple but easy to make mistakes if you aren’t well trained or you don’t pay attention. Customers are generally not too bad at all and employees can be good sources of morale. You also get access to an employee discount of 10% and you can apply for a Target Red Card even as an employee. Sometimes food from the grocery side of the store will be offered to employees though I believe only when close to or past expiration. There were also free employee treats and events. However, management wais predictably shrewd, condescending and passive-aggressive at times. They care more about sales, enforcing policies and productivity than treating you like a fellow employee or a human being. Also all new hires are temporary for a ninety day probation period so to speak, many people get laid off near the end of the holiday season as well so if you actually want to stay awhile try to get trained in as many areas as possible. But I’d recommend that you stay only temporarily, look for a better job during your time here because your sweat and blood will be better spent elsewhere and in all probability your paycheck would be bigger too."
good,"validating data, writing SQL scripts, loading data, extracting data, analyzing data.  Target has already decided who they want to promote, so if you are not on the list, there is no chance to get promoted.  The last few years that I worked at Target was not enjoyable.  Target is a micromanaging company in all aspects of the company, from HR down to the stores.   The hardest part of the job was the continuous change.  I had many years of great and respectful management, but in the last year, my manager was unavailable and was not truthful or honest.  Since being gone from Target, I feel very relieved and happier."
good,"doing go backs, organizing your sections, getting the work done right and on time is easy. you'll have days you just can't get anything done because you're all over the store helping out guests, dont stress over it, then the days you finish before time and it gives you time to review your section couple of times."
good,Target is a great place to start your working life.  They have very flexible schedules for kids in school and easy enough for the younger person to get a tier one management position to help get them experience.
good,"Busy and lots to do. People there are relaxed in their uniforms and that is nice. Friendly atmosphere, and accepting of all people. Opportunity to be helpful and communicate with clients."
good,"If you're working here you must have another job, because there's noo way to support yourself with the hours they give you. One week they might give you 27, the next 10..like how am I suppose to feed myself with that? And then they have there nerve to be down your throats about the sale of red cards and being up a customer's behind! ha"
good,great experience I just didn't like that we had to advertise the red card. The knowledge I obtained is very great to have though overall it was a great time working there.
good,"Target was my first real job after High school. I enjoyed the work experience. I learned a lot about responsibility and time management. It showed me how to multitask in my position. You had to work as a team and that is what I enjoyed the most. I was probably one of the youngest on my team when I started, and that allowed me to learn from the older members. Management wasn't the easy to get along with. They didn't seem to be all on the same page. They lack communication with each other, would cause problems with staff sometimes. My hours were always getting cut because they would have to many people working one week and the next week I would work one day."
good,"The main problem was my boss hired his friend for my job and switched me to another department after a month of doing that job."
good,Ideal job I liked doing but changes happening so fast and did not get asked just pushed off to. Favoritism was well played for this type of employment. Unorganized.
good,Honestly was pretty happy for a while but eventually got worn down due to poor management and stress. Store Team Lead is incompetent and a jerk. Literally the only person I had a problem with though. Due to recent pay structure changes the difference between my wages and the wages of those I was supervising decreased significantly.
good,The wage that I received at Target was not enough to support a family.  Most people that worked at Target when I was there had two jobs and then still struggled to make ends meet.
good,"The day starts with the greetings of good morning and smiles as well as sense of urgency as we prepare for the guests. I have learned how to serve large amounts of guests while attending to the products to be sold. It can be overwhelming at times, but my co-workers understood the pressure and would gladly switch roles as I took deep breaths and plunged back into the fray. Everyone in Target is helpful or at least makes the attempt. I suppose the hardest part of the job arrives in the evening when it is time to close. For the most part, one is left alone in their station to make sure that everything is properly shut down and adequately prepared for the next day's adventure.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the occasional smiles of gratitude from the guests as they recognize a job well done."
good,Gives you the experience you need for retail. Team effort. Fast pace. Always something to do. Breaks and lunch time is a fair amount of time. What I enjoyed most was the friends made.
good,This type of work is good for temporary not for a career. I would not recommend this type of work for someone who is looking for a meaningful career or a career with some type of future
good,i went in the moring and i was getting the stuff that needed to go on the floor and also i was outting stuff away that was coming from the truck i left to have better job placement
good,A LOT of barking on the radios by management. I liked the people I worked with but the guests were VERY rude and treated us like maids. The store was always messy because guests were lazy.
good,The management was not so friendly and at times it was way too busy. I felt like management had to hired more cashiers but to safe money they did not.
good,They could not even recall my name (sadly) when I was asked to come in to review my resume and info as I was or had gotten constant praise for getting good reviews for excellent customer service in the store regarding my customer service going above and beyond helping others within the store with any and all I can  to make their shopping experience an amazing trip to enjoy.<3
good,"target is a good company, just the location i worked at had poor managment."
good,target was not a good place to work at. it was very stressful and the management was terrrible. they lacked communication adn was not organized at all.
good,"*A typical work day would be fast past and full of task to complete so the time went by faster."
good,It was a seasonal job. Very high turnover rate and changed managers often. I wouldn't go back. Maybe you will have a better experience. Still there are better jobs out there.
good,"Retail is one of the first jobs that many young adults apply for and successfully get hired. Like all retail companies, it can be very stressful, especially during the holiday season. It depends on management. Some places have good management, some places don't."
good,I enjoyed those I worked with but did not care for those I worked for. Tried to advance into management and was met by my careless managers every time
good,The strong push for red cards was really frusterating. Managers weren't really around when you needed them. cashiers didn't get walky talkies when I felt that cashiers were the people who needed them most. But all other employees made working a fun experience.
good,"Depending upon where you work, determines when you arrive.  You would usually never see the sun rise.  Finding a good manager depends upon the store.  You have coworkers what will never help you because of the workloads.  I rarely ever saw the area supervisor.  You have a mix of different people to work with.  Some make you feel like a horrible worker, some actually help you out."
good,On a busy day the time flies and work is manageable.  Staff is friendly and eager to help with any questions.  The customers are always the priority and the staff does their best to insure they feel welcomed and comfortable.
good,"Its fine really, as retail goes i've had much worse.  I don't particularly like my boss, but store management is pretty good on the whole.  Me and several others were flagged for promotion, put into a training program, and then...they got busy and never bothered to actually move forward with the program.  Its seems it only comes up when it can be used to threaten/guilt us into working extra shifts etc.  That kind of tanked my morale... Still, a decent enough workplace if you have no ambition and just want work."
good,"I was in cafe, I actually like working there but magament wasn't the best in the world and they were actually really rude. They told me a week before my 90 days ended that they weren't going to keep me and that the other LOD's talked to me about this, no other managers ever talked to me about my work so I was shocked and they kept telling me they were talking to me every week. Needless to say I wouldn't reccomnd working for them"
good,"its a job, it may not help you pay the bills unless you are a supervisor. it can be stressful, but what job isn't""t.  I work over night and it can become really stressful on your body."
good,"It was an ok job, I just didn't like retail very much. The hours weren't so bad, I wasn't gone for two weeks due to hours shortage like my recent job."
good,"I love working. I love meeting people. I have a great personality. I'm very humble. I highly dislike this particular Target store. Very evil people. The managers bully team members, there's harassment going on daily, the mangers do not lead by example, there's favoritism and racism. That store is bad by all means, It's sad because it was once a great place to be. Now, myself and many others, are trying our best to leave."
good,we are all as a family at target the managers are very respectful to one another as well as their employees.we also have team work so when one department finishes their work they go help out at other departments
good,"this was a great environment for someone who has just started working, there are opportunities for advancement, you can only go so far w/o a degree. I did not like how management gave me a new position as a human resource specialist but I was never given a raise or compensated for the position, basically I was still earning a cashier salary but doing work for management."
good,"All the bosses there pick favorites. If you aren't in their ""group"" they shut you out. You don't get paid enough for what you do there, and all the bosses are lazy, and do no work what so ever."
good,"Management is  severely overworked, which gets pushed down to the team members. If you have a thick skin and enjoy helping people and having fun with your coworkers... I say go for it. If you are looking for a career, advancement, benefits, effort based rewards... Target isn't for you."
good,"It was a good low end job. However, I am a little upset given the circumstances of my departure from said company without going into intricate detail."
good,early morning hours unloading trucks is not fun.  short hours when in slow times for retail.  can be a fun work environment depending on your coworkers.  management tends to let it's mood swings effect decisions.
good,The employment was terrible and the management and the store was always messy. I never recommend working at that location ever again. I didnt get the proper training what so ever I just learned from the employees that was in my same position or different position. The mangerment was very messy they were the one that really started up the drama and  gossip .Also the employee was very mean and rude and some were friendly and nice .It was only like that in the beginning until they showed their true colors .
good,Supervisors change every 2 years. Every 2 years you have to know a new supervisor and learn their way of working. It is not enough time to get familiar with your new supervisor.
good,I just unloaded a truck and stocked shelves all day. Really nothing too it other than that not much to learn from it gave good hours so the pay was alright
good,"the work life balance for this job, is not always the best. scheduling is always troublesome and not always accurate people promised 40hr week upon employment does not always get it"
good,I worked there for a year and it was a good company to an extent the management is horrible. And communication could be a lot better between supervisors and higher up the chain of command.
good,"Have been working at Target for 2 years, I would recommend Target to others because as a corporation it is a great place to work. The only reason I am rating it as 3 star, is because of the management. Management plays a huge factor in how the store is operated. Some store are amazing while other have a lot of tensions within the management."
good,"This is a great place to work if you are a kid out of high school and just looking for a whatever kind of job. It was a horrible place to work for, for it being what it is (Retail)...."
good,Overall good starting position. Sometimes moving up possible but not always based on qualifications. Favorites can be played. There is a lack of understanding at times when unforeseen circumstances arise.
good,Overall it is a decent seasonal position. there is no real job security. there is a lot of hiring outside of the rather than promote from within. not a place with long term advancement
good,It wasn't what I expected. I was disappointed that they weren't very accommodating to certain disability I had. I thought this was a company that would try to make employees feel safe at work. I didn't feel that way.
good,"management at my area target is 1 good manager to 5 bad ones. Usually they ignore issues or make you seem like its your fault for whatever. pay is good if you get the hours, which they cut regularly at my store, even though they say they wont anymore. never fails. Problems with coworkers are also ignored or put down no matter who or how much you bring it up. A typical day in softlines is reshop and guest service. Hardlines is the same but they also have pulls to restock the shelves. cashiering is just ringing and guest service. cashier managers are great. overall it depends on the store, managers, and your coworkers. Vacation is dependent on how much you work, no paid sick,no paid personal, and you only get paid vacation of you work regular hours, this includes any benfits or insurance."
good,"I worked for Target seasonally. I started Black Friday and ended the January after. It was an Okay place to work. But, because it was a seasonal position I did not try to get rooted in the company."
good,Target is EXTREMELY low paying in comparison to other comparable retail positions.  Many employees are local college students.  One of the Pro's is the company is willing to work with student schedules.  A big con is this company pays minimum wage.  This is not a job for anyone trying to make a living.  I was in a supervisory position with 7 years leadership experience making $8.10 an hour.  My anual raise was .10.  The company is involved in many community events which is a positive.
good,My co workers are the best thing about this job. Targets is a great place to work. The pushing for red-cards can be a little much. to focused on the numbers instead of the Relationship  between the Guest and the employees.
good,Good company just managment didnt care about employess and never mad schecdule to what the team needed to work so it made it hard to work there espically if you were in school
good,There was always something to do. Staying on your feet for 5 hours was always a challenge but it never gets boring. You maintain your department and than assist other departments or assist with coverage in cashier.
good,"Although I enjoyed it at Target, we had a quota per shift of ""red cards"" ie:Target credit cards. After the hacking the Christmas before, there were not a lot of takers. I felt that, as a minimum wage employee, I shouldn't be required to have a minimum.  Customers would actually scream at us for even suggesting a red card."
good,I worked for Target for a little over 6 months and my overall experience was good.  They have a tendency to overwork the employees that are willing to work.  I didn't like the shifts I was given on a consistent basis (3 pm to close) almost every single shift.
good,"I've worked for this company for many years in the past. When I went back, this last time, it wasn't the same. Just the environment and culture has dramatically changed. It was a lot of fun when I worked with the crew that I had those years. Now I wouldn't even recommend even working here. Unless you're desperate for a job and want no work/life balance. I've worked with some pretty cool people. Some I still stay in touch with. Some just disappear and you never hear from them again. I wouldn't recommend this job, considering the amount of stress and the management nonsense you have to go through. The job is not that bad but there are a few people in management that needs to go."
good,"The satisfaction of helping a customer is very rewarding, especially if you know your job. Very upbeat company to work for. Their is always some type of goal. The hardest part of the job is trying to do a job that you are not being trained at. It's a learn as you go type job. Many different employees that are friendly and willing to help."
good,I enjoyed working in customer service target was all about team work and appreciation everyone was worked as if we were family I enjoyed working in customer service even when short staffed
good,It's great if you have  really flexible schedule. Wouldn't recommend to people looking for a fixed schedule job. Lots of opportunities to cross train in other departments.
good,"As a cashier, no matter how great you are if you do not get red cards (even though Target has been hacked) you will be fired. I think customer service should count for something."
good,"Red Cards are the only concern for managers. They do not care if you do not like where you are placed on the floor, they will continue to schedule you there. The people that are not superiors are awesome but the management makes me dread working."
good,The people you work with will make your day. Some of the customers truly gives you hope about this world others will bring you back to reality. That being said nothing is complicated but its time consuming if you work in soft lines.
good,I felt like my life was being sucked out of me. Every day I was constantly hounded by managers to help other departments (mainly cashiers) because there was no one there. It was difficult to do my work because they would hire or schedule more cashiers.
good,Probably have to like being under stress and like having a hard dead set deadline. Have to meet designated expectations everyday. Little room for making errors. Faced paced high intensity level through the whole day.
good,"Most team members and peers are good people and understand normal ups and downs of a job. Management/Executives will ""yes"" you to death an claim they understand your issues and want to help.but don't act upon these promises."
good,Management wasn't in good hands and wouldn't approach you with a positive attitude. I always did my hardest but all I received was negative feedback from our new boss's.
good,Although great growth opportunities are present with the company they're difficult to obtain do to constant changes made with managerial positions. Few accommodations are made to assist team members in developing a healthy work life balance.
good,"Loved working with the customers and fellow employees. It was fast paced and an energetic work place. The hardest part of the job was talking the Guests into signing up for red cards no matter how hard your worked during your shift or how efficient you were.. On a daily you were criticized for not getting Red Cards on your shift or when you met your goal it was YOU COULD OF GOTTEN MORE... "
good,This was one job that I do not miss. I enjoyed working around the customers but not so much the employees or management. I tried advancing but it seemed that they already had their favorites picked out.
good,"Target seems to have very little room for growth, they make it very difficult to promote and to work full time; which you need to receive any of their benefits. Management is seems to do very little to help its employees; made me feel overly dispensable personally."
good,"I am unsure if it was due to being young, but I do not recall great benefits, management was hard on new hires, very catty coworkers, not a lot of education required for positions here"
good,I was happy working there at one time.  I am not receiving enough hours per week anymore used to get 32 now getting 16 due to new management.
good,It is a good place to work if you work full time. Sales floor is fast paced and fun. I did not work as much as I would like but if you are looking for a first job it is a good place to work.
good,The team leads run the store some are bad and some are good. You do your job and go home. Some times Its hard to do your job when store gets insanely packed with Guests.
good,The co-works are amazing to work with. They always make sure they can help you out with anything you need. The team leaders try and help to help you out and much as they can with a problem that you may have.
good,My experience over time at Target grew drastically different from the first months of my employment to the end of my tenor there. Target work culture is one of poor management style and inability to communicate leading to the development of a poorly run retail space.
good,All they really care about is their RED card...they don't care about anything else and there's not much room for advancement unless you are really cool with the supervisors
good,"I've been at Target for over 6 years and I've learned a bit of experience in every department, I feel now I am ready for a new chapter in my life, new experiences."
good,"stocking shelves is not that hard changing sings is fun,I learn a lot about inventor.shiping/reciving and how to set up store display.management could have care more but was fare. most of the worker were nice.the hardest part of the job was learding computer or    po compter. we work at grave yard shift so the most  enjoyable was going home ."
good,I have worked at target for years while it is a fun place to work there is no way to live off the pay and work schedule that they offer
good,Job was good while it lasted. It was a temp role that allowed me to work with a major company such as Proctor and Gamble learning the aspects of the warehouse environment
good,"Easy going and easy work. Weekends are very stress baring. They leave no acceptions to any request to work regular hours Mon-Fri. Required to work weekends even though it is hard to as a single mom. Yet others who work there have somehow gotten the schedule of mon-fri but are available to work on weekends and have no idea why they don't. Hours are always all over the place. Almost never get a full 40 hours a week like needed. In all honesty the best part of the job is Co-workers. They work as a team and always help each other. The only other thing is that the store looks great in the morning but if you come in the after noon, it looks terrible and you can never find anyone around who works there."
good,"There is no structure of how things are ran, left to interpretations. Trainers aren't even provided training, just assumed they are qualified to train since they have been working at that location for longer than a year. When asked for resolution on problems was denied solutions and only given objective responses."
good,Forget working here if you're approaching your 40's.  The job culture at Target actively seeks to push out it's older team members in favor of younger people that they can pay less.
good,"It is a great place to start off in life but for me, I need a job that allows me to be more creative and with more responsibilities."
good,"Target was a good first job. It taught me a lot about responsibility, customer service, and just life in the workplace. I got along well with the majority of my coworkers, however management was difficult at times. I always felt as if I needed to watch my back, and that I really needed to watch what I said. It was not a good management system for a multitude of reasons. There was a very clear and evident double standard between management and the rest of the staff. I learned much from this job however, and I don't think I'd choose differently it if I were ever able to go back in time and make a different choice."
good,It was a typical day at work. I learned how to pack and pick. The management people was good and respectful and really fun. The workers where great and cool to be around. It wasn't a hard part at my job. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"There was no ""getting to know"" the other employees and not knowing the schedule more than 2 weeks in advance made it difficult to get a second part-time job. Some weeks I worked 4 hours and some 18. VERY little training. Just thrown on a register and told to turn on the light. Having to call over an associate every time a new situation arose was embarrassing. Something as little as a different payment method meant calling for help to find out how to do it as there was zero training ahead of time. "
good,I enjoyed being able to decorate cupcakes on my down time. I appreciated available food in the break room. Mostly worked alone in the bakery. Management was not friendly and never gave constructive criticism.
good,"A typical day at target usually was a smooth one. This job was only seasonal. I learned how to move pallets and stock a variety of products. Management were very nice and helpful. Co-workers are enjoyable, the most diverse group I've ever worked with. They always made overnights enjoyable...the hardest part of the job is lifting heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job is the short break & pay is not bad either."
good,"I worked as the Presentation Team Lead for my store. My team members either quit for lack of hours or were forced out by management. I was tasked with doing the work of a team of 5-6 by myself. The benefits are great with full medical, dental, and vision. Also given the option of a 401K. My fellow team members who did not work in my department were great but overall it taught me that while I do have room to grow and learn as a leader, retail is not for me."
good,"I worked at 4am and the wages were poor. The management at my particular store was not very good as well, but has since been replaced.  It is a typical retail setting."
good,"Working overnights is different than working a day shift. You would think you would get paid more since this is a multi billion dollar company but they pay isn't that good. You do get breaks and lunches and the store I worked at even fed you sometimes. Discount is ok, better than nothing. Hardest part is staying awake if you don't get much sleep during the day."
good,"Overall wising college during this expedience. Great team to work with, and great personalities. Hours was limited and they was a bit unorganized. Everyday routine was simple and easy work load."
good,Work  life balance was not an option. Everyday workers were treated poorly and given short hours due to business demands.
good,"Busy organizing area & cashiering. Organization and people skills. Helped train in my areas. Team players. Not hard, just tedious. Interacting with customers."
good,Luckily I catch on too things fast so It doesn't hinder me much but it makes it hard when they dont give you the right info to help you through it all
good,"The organization as a whole is an enjoyable place to work but requires a lot of personal sacrifice. The team that you work for and create can be a very enjoyable experience, but sometimes the support from superiors can be absent during key moments. The emphasis is on delivering solid guest service results by focusing on operational excellence and bottom line profit. I learned how to deliver great results, build strong teams, and network within the organization."
good,"My Target had great coworkers, but management lacked in scheduling and professionalism. The hardest part of my job was staying interested in company direction. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with all kinds of people."
good,"I worked in a tester store with a new roll out position in 200 stores."
good,"a nice environment, always busy with something to do. I received employee discounts and enhanced my skills to work with others."
good,"The beauty of retail, there are no typical days. I honestly can say I have learned to be more understanding and assertive in pushing my career aspirations. Target offers leaders a great opportunity to manage and lead your team, but the lack of overall support can make things difficult.  With all that said the greatest part of my time at target was the opportunity to work with so many amazing people."
good,At Target it was laid back attitude type of job. It did not seem like all of my coworkers or managers took their job seriously. So this was defiantly not the job for me.
good,"Boring"
good,"typical day at work was helping guests locate items that they were looking for, straightening shelves, restocking misplaced items, and restocking shelves with new inventory"
good,"I believe as far as retail employment is concerned Target weighs far better than most.  Typically they understood work life balance and worked with you where they could.  They expect you to cross train and work in multiple places, which I like, but can frustrate or be difficult to some. management for the most part is great, store level management almost uses scare tactics to employees about upper/corporate management and when there is a visit everybody is scared to death to even breathe."
good,"My typical day would start around noon, as soon as I reach work our whole team would work on employees leaving the organization and then that's how the start of the day goes by. Being here helped to understand how important it is finish the work on time be compliant and finish the task with quality. Communication is very important in an organization be it any task. Management helps the teams to be accountable for the work and  keep the team bound together. Some of my co-worker have been my mentors which has helped me to go a long way. Through their support it was easier to learn and adjust to the new environment of corporate life. The hardest part would be working on holidays,  most of the time work required us to be present during our holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting appreciated when the work is finished with quality."
good,You would go to work and do everything you are asked to do and your manager would take all the credit for what you had done.  You would never get the credit for it. I learned the wrong way to manage employees and that they promise that there is room for advancement when you are hired and they fall back on their word after the fact.  My co-workers were very friendly and enjoyable to work with.
good,Granted I worked here in high school and a few years after they were very stingy on raises. Started at 7.50 and after 4 years I was making 7.94 an hour. I worked hard and did my job better than most cart attendants with little reward.
good,Target has taught me a great amount that will help me in the future however promotion is very difficult as the store managers receive a bonus for every assistant manager hired from outside the company.
good,"Learn a lot but there  was a lack of growth opportunities. Management was a mess pretty much every month we have different LODs, store managers dont stay there for a long time. I was hard on times. Co-workers were fine, I had helpful ones. We were a nice group at the beginning, hours starting to get cut."
good,The Management made it very hard to work here and the co workers always complained about everything. i learn how to work a cash resister and how to answer the phone and transfers calls
good,"it can be challenging, butit's really simple. But there are some managers who do not know how to run a store. and mess up the whole cycle of the store."
good,"I was not able to advance any further within this company regardless of experience or interest.  That was due to having to work holidays, stay late, and in general miss my son's entire first grade year. I do not recommend this company if you are focused on your family."
good,Not a bad place to work but not the greatest. The company and the ideas of the company are good ideas but the people in each store will change and handle everything in their own way.
good,Unloading the truck each night and stocking designated departments and assisted other team members when an area was short-handed There were plenty of great people to work with and some of the management team were easy to talk to if there was a problem
good,"I loved working with the public and with my staff. I like interacting with others, and only left because Target closed it's doors. However, Target closing it's doors allowed me to go back to school to obtain my Medical Office Administration Honours diploma.Good came out of being there!"
good,"Target is a great place to gain experience, however, it is not an ideal place to build a career. Target has great team members and always has a positive work environment."
good,a work day at target was long management didn't help and could be  rude most of the time.my co workers helped me more than anything the hard part of the job is being soft lines and back up cashier you don't get extra pay for it and the cashiers don't help you on the floor once store closed
good,For the most part the work is easy and straight forward but management is horrible. Benefits are very little. This is job to  just get by until you find something better. Coworkers are great.
good,it was a good experience for customer service and unloading trucks and pulling merchandise to stock shelves and how to work with customers and different items
good,"Target never gives full time hours. Because if done so, they will be forced to give benefits and they do not want to do so. I feel the pay is too little for us to have to be cross trained in different areas of the store , acquiring more tasks and having to put up with people who put us down on the job. Management is also very bad. Pushed on a daily basis to get red card applications and not receive anything."
good,I started out at one store as a full-time worker and got transferred to another store with lesser hours. The management is not as friendly as the other location that I transferred from. Coworkers are very shy. The hardest part is the hours and the most enjoyable are the customers.
good,"Customer service clerk "
good,"The job i very simple doesn't require a lot hard work. Interact with guest. Schedule is very demanding work weekends preferably nights. Hardest part is trying to get the weekend off holidays. The most enjoyable part are some of your co workers, and free food occasionally."
good,"I love working with this diverse group of people - there is always an interesting topic of discussion, and something new to learn. We are all a bit wacky, especially considering we are willing to start our work day at 4am. The hardest part of the job is probably some of the heavy lifting at times, but there's always another team member ready to jump in and help."
good,"When new management comes in you always expect some changes. New manager does not have the experience to deal with the day to day operations in the store. No direction on what to do with etl's when there job is not done. Always finding ways to cut hours set by corporate. Team members are always under the gun and cannot be fun,fast and friendly."
good,It's a fun place to work. the co-workers are nice to work with and everyone gets along with each other. They want you to pressure the customers into getting the extras which is kind of nice to some customers.
good,My retail experience has increased greatly since working at target. I have learned so many things about the business and customer service as a whole.
good,Fun to work with my coworkers but. I always end up doing extra work that was not part of the job description. There is a bunch of managers that do not work at all but there is some that do work throughout the day. The best part is you get the freedom to take your   own lunches/breaks when u need them.
good,"its a job "
good,"I have worked at a super target & smaller targets as a cashier our job is to promote targets credit & debit cards, Apps, and great shopping experience, Management in better at larger target stores and respectful, I've enjoyed meeting different people."
good,"busy fun place to work, learned many different jobs, many things to keep you busy, lot of great customers, Very supportive store manager"
good,"restocked or replenish shelves in hardlines and softness area."
good,"With the amount of layoffs that Target is undergoing, Not sure this a a safe place to work at anymore. It used to be an amazing place to work at.  Really hope that this Minnesota based company overcome the challenges it's facing with the new management and unclear goals and vision."
good,Galyan's is no longer a company. It was sold to Dick's. It was a fast paced place to work during the holidays and at inventory time. Lots of clothes to fold and back packs to set up for display. Coworkers were great to work with. Hardest part was dealing with kids that were dropped off by parents who used the mall as child care.
good,"Working at the Target on City Ave. was exactly what I thought it would be, messy with just a hint of professionalism. We never had a night where there were everyone came in to work."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking care of re-shop, cashier, making sure the fitting rooms were organized and also taking calls and helping customers with any assistance. Being there taught me how to operate the cash register and how to take on any situations or problems that came my way while working there. The management there was very consistent. Many of my co-workers were off task and created many set backs for the whole team. The hardest part of the job was when the co-workers weren't working as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was when tasks were completed and pleasing my customers and managers."
good,Target was always busy and heart warming with young bright employees. Always motivated to meet store qualification. Supervisors could've been a little ore helpful but overall fun place to work.
good,great starter job while in collage however many late nights with seldom advancement opportunities. GREAT TEAM... Team lead opportunies very hard to get
good,Company is evolving rapidly and initiating major overhauls of all business sectors. I did enjoy the team members and the ability to grow as a leader through several years of challenging times.
good,"Their is no appreciation if you are employed here for the work that you do even if you get a 100% job performance for the day they say that you can still do better and just work harder tomorrow to improve.  If you don't at least get the 100% they tell you that if you don't make it tomorrow then you may not have a job the day after.  You get no benefits, no days off, and the pay is not worth what you have to put up with.  You have to give eleven months before consideration to be hired and with in the first month of being a temp you are already looking for another job."
good,"I worked here for four years, had good days and bad. Really depends on how competent your management is. If you get nice managers and 40 hours a week, this can be a decent gig."
good,"A typical day is helping our guest, fill, and enter prescriptions.  What I have learned more skills such as managing inventory, better serving our guests, and better phone etiquette. The management is alright not the greatest because of how co-workers and I are treatment sometimes. The hardest part of the job is satisfying our guests. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping our guests save money and getting the medications they need."
good,"Unload trailers, manage a productive team, coach, teach and recognize. Deliver amazing guest experience.work in high volume store and manage 30+ plus team members."
good,"I worked second shift part time and my responsibilities mainly were to re-stock shelves with merchandise for the customers. Typical day for me was working from Eleven a.m to Eight p.m. When I'd arrive I would clock in go to the back check for any carts that needed to go out to the floor. I would spend the majority of the day filling and emptying these carts out to the store shelves. If backup was needed as a cashier or cart collector I would often volunteer to break the monotony of re-stocking shelves. "
good,management takes all the credit for all the work and show no recognize to anyone else. always expects you to come in to work even you are sick. Has no respect for your outside life just come into work at any cost
good,work at Target for 27 years. No longer a good company to work for. They cut hours to part time with no benefits or vacation time
good,stocking shelves the co-workers were great the hardest part was getting up at 4 am on Sundays. the best part of the job was the other people who i worked with
good,"Fun place to work."
good,"The management weren't the best they would over work us and wouldn't make us take breaks. I got along with them I didn't really talk to them much cause always worked alone and when I did, I couldn't understand them."
good,Target would be great for someone looking for a part time job while in school. They carry flexible work hours. The work is not very hard and you get a 10% discount on purchases. It can sometimes get busy but morning shifts are usually slow. It wouldn't hurt if they paid a little bit better.
good,Not much room for advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people you work with and get to know. The not so great stuff is hardly any advancement or more hours. Take that into consideration.
good,"Great salary and strong benefits packages do not outweigh the poor communication, and upper leadership involvement. Lack of direction in company strategy and chances for upward mobility."
good,"Part time retail postion, hours per week can swing wildly and when those hours are can change from week to week, so don't bother scheduling anything outside of work."
good,"A typical day at work for me was checking out multiple costumers throughout the day."
good,"Target is a good place to work while attending college, however, the expectations of you are far too high for the amount of pay you receive. I was in what Target calls its ""pipeline"" for management for 3 years and after exceeding all of their expectations, despite being overly qualified for positions within company, I am continually over looked because of politics within the company I have still had no opportunities for advancement."
good,A typical day at work consisted of unloading and stocking. Once all items had been unloaded I had to take all trash to a compactor for disposal. Having this job taught me how to manage my time wisely. I also learned how to organize merchandise so that it would catch the attention of the consumer. Overall the team work was okay. The hardest part about the job was unloading the truck in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part about the job was actually unloading the truck and stocking the shelves.
good,"Was a good place to work, but managment went wrong with accusing me about damaging property when I never did. That put a damper on my opininon about them. Was never able to get around management to move around different areas of the store when I was promised to be trained elsewhere and just got stuck doing carts. Was cut hours after they hired somewhere around 100 people, most of them was cashiers. Had to move and was promised a transfer, but that was not communicated well at all so they said I had quit when I only wanted to transfer."
good,"Target used to be an amazing company to work for...recently leadership changes and expectations have made working there a nightmare."
good,I kept very busy in my department doing resets and revisions to get ready for the new releases of the week. I learned many different things like how to send extra inventory back to the manufacturer or how to order product and keep inventory levels where they need to be. The management was stressful as they expected you to not only do your job but the job of many others in your day and they had unrealistic goals. The hardest part of my job before management would get involved was having all the resets done and the product ready for the next day as they released then. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers find what they were looking for and the job in itself.
good,"Overnight unloading truck, pulled pallot to floor, push product to shelves, "
good,"A typical day at work would consist of being busy, doing way more then whats in the job discription. I didnt learn anything from Target. Managaement was lazy and never seem to do their job. The co-workers was great help which i enjoyed. The hardest part is doing someone else job and not getting paid more."
good,It wasn't the best. I only worked 2 days a week which was not enough to survive and take care of my family.
good,"meetings, stocking shelves, some nice employees but had problems with my schedule a lot due to school."
good,"Target is a great company to work for if you are going to school or need experience. Working at a high volume store created a lot of stress, but work had to get done. I do think target pays pharmacy staff very little for the ton of work that is expected to be done."
good,Target is a great place to learn from and start your career in retail management.
good,Great company to work for if you can survive on $1000 a month with early hours and no over time
good,"I can't begin to tell you how unorganized and unprofessional this team was. I began working there during the holiday season, it was crazy. after the season ended, it got crazier. The whole store was completely unorganized. Management would go out together and come to work the next day completely hungover. All of them. My manager, made us do her paper work, order everything we needed, and pretty much every job she had. She would sit in the back on her telephone, constantly. She never worked a night shift. The environment was unsuccessful and unrewarding. I was given ever closing shift because I was the ""youngest."" It wasn't fair, there was very little growth in my pay and I worked there for a year and 6 months. I got a .50 raise over the year and a half I was there. They give you a 10% team member discount, it pretty much took away the tax.I wouldn't recommend a Target position to ANYONE."
good,Poor management led to lack of hours and poor work enviorment
good,"The management isn't the best. The pay isn't enough for the work that's required. The motto should be "" Expect More Work Pay You Less!!"" No one tries to help you move up through the company for advancement."
good,"You only need to be a Pharmacy Technician when the store is busy. In ""Down Time"" (catch up time), it's time for you to go help the rest of the store do their jobs, or go home and come back when it's busy again. There is no rewards/encouragement for advancement."
good,"I'd rather not give my personal opinion about this job. It's a job, you make an hourly rate, you get a review every year, there are benefits, it is what it is."
good,"A good place to get basic training across the board (Warehouse, Customer Service, Stocking, Unloading). Not the best management wise, or corporate policy wise. Great place to work, to get to know people, and make some friends."
good,A typical day at work would include helping customers find there needs and checking them out.
good,Really enjoyed working for Target when I had first started but shortly after the economic crash in 2008 they began to restructure their work practices and it became difficult to attempt to work up with in the company.
good,You had no benefits. Great for someone who wants a part time job with low wages.
good,"Not enough hours went from 20 hrs to 4 hrs a week. "
good,"I spent most of my time on my own, without guidance and/or an individual to go for assistance/training or advice."
good,"Typical day was standing at the check stand, while also making sure the candy bars were stacked in correct order. The company I think is fine, but I didn't like the management. The hardest part of the job was working with the management. The peers were very lazy, and I was forced to pick up a lot of other peoples slack."
good,I did not work here long but this was a great working environment.
good,"A typical work day would be clock in 5 mins early get to work location and start work, break time generally two hours after start work full flow and backroom team together, huddle for group recognition and updates on store progress. I learned how to become more assertive. The management when I started was great very upbeat fun energetic and hard working, however it changed about one year after and the whole moral of the flow team when to an extreme decrease, new management was pretty unfair with expectations and demands. New management did not show they really new what they were doing seemed very confused or flustered most of the time. The hardest part of the job was being short staffed on double truck days, however was still manageable. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers they were just like a second family, everyone for the most part worked extremely well together and were always very helpful to one another."
good,"My first few days at Target were good as I was easing into the new feel of this job. But when it came to training, my Supervisor failed miserably to train me properly. She wouldn't answer my questions, didn't go over certain steps and basically left me to fend for myself."
good,"There is not a typical work day schedule. During Thanksgiving, Christmas/ New Years you will need to work until 3:30am in the morning. "
good,A typical day at work for me was running the register and working with customers. I learned how to improve on my communication skills. Management was good and I enjoyed the working with the co-workers. There wasn't anything hard about the job and I enjoyed working there.
good,"Took advantage of skills and abilities to preform duties that were beyond expected job duties in order to not fill a position with a higher wage."
good,Early hours. Unload the truck and put the product on the shelves. Co-workers are kind and involved. Managers are stressful but appear to be friendly. Heavy boxes and grumpy managers are the hardest part of the job. The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Repetitive work, managers that do not want to share knowledge but want you to be the good little robot that you are."
good,made me understand my work ethic.. worked the hardest possible
good,A job that doesn't give much hours. This is a fun place to work due to the people you work with.
good,"I worked here for three years, seasonally, but I was never paid anything past minimum wage or worked anything other than a cashier."
good,Great company.  Very large which requires many inputs and processes to make decisions.
good,"Greet and assist all customers in the Electronics Department"
good,"Target had a good atmosphere as far as friendly and fast service. The pay was minimal however, and room for advancement was nonexistent for the most part. My coworkers were very friendly and everyone was a team."
good,"In my short time in this position, there wasn't anything special about going to work. Co-workers weren't sociable, management never check to see if any assistance was needed, and turnover rate is high."
good,"requires transfer after 18 months - difficult if you have young children at home"
good,"Most of my scheduled hours were on the sales floor, assisting customers, replenishing stock, clearing fitting rooms and covering cash desks when needed."
good,Fast paced place. Enjoy helping guest with different questions.
good,"Ok, I wasn't impressed with the training they provided, each night it was a different person, with a different or lack of training."
good,"A typical day would be unloading trucks manually, stocking shelves, and back stocking items that didn't fit on shelves. I learned that working with a team can get things done faster, and I learned that from past experience by working with a coworkers, not from a Team Lead or a Manager. Some managers are cool, depending on if they like you, otherwise you have to gain their interest in you. Some team leads actually help you or work with the team, most of the others just stand around and watch you work, than write you up for little things like not having a red shirt or wearing short when you are not working with guest. Coworkers are very dedicated as a team, fun and outgoing. The hardest part would be trying new things or giving your team lead a suggestion to try new alternatives for the company, but they would never consider your idea. The most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers."
good,"Everyday was about the same, once in a while i'd have guests who weren't too friendly but it didn't really phase me because the number of nice guests out weighed the mean. I learned that no matter what your doing in life people will find a way to judge you including sometimes your manager (he didn't judge my work but my financial situation.) The manager that hired me quickly became a little more then a nuisance. Whenever i would go on my lunch he would say something like ""Don't you need money for that"" and it hurt because he didn't just say it to my face but in front of other people who would later tell me ""I'm sorry he said that"" or ""He shouldn't be allowed to say that"" The hardest part of the job was when guests were in a hurry and i was doing my best which they couldn't see and having to ask guests if they wanted our debit/credit card which i got 13 in the time i was there. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able give stickers to children or cheer them up with a sticker when they were upset. ( I know how hard it is to deal with a screaming toddler)"
good,Typical day was interacting with customers and making sure customers left with a good experience. Learned good customer interaction and good customer service always makes a customer leave smiling. Management was so mixed up they had no clue what one manager was doing in what department. Very unorganized. Co-workers where knowledgeable more than the managers were. Hardest part of the job was checking your hours on a daily basis because they would change them and not notify you. The best part was interacting with the customers.
good,My work day consist of doing pushes and pulls from the back room and carrying them to the floor.
good,very early morning hours would recommed as first job not much room to advance
good,"From recent experience, Target Corporation lacked effective communication.  The STL would give different directives than my direct supervisor (ETL-Logistics).  The typical day included acknowledging and process the daily truck, three days a week a food truck was also received.  My fellow team leads were supportive, helpful and a pleasure to work with, as were most of the ETL's.  "
good,"Great job to learn and develop skills but not a career."
good,I loved the people that I worked with and the job but unforunately the hours were slowly dwindling
good,"You are responsible for the merchandise in the store. Make sure, that nothing is stolen."
good,Making sure you stock the products onto the floor in the correct department.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target because I love fashion, and I love to do customer service, and helping others period!"
good,go place to start. parttime/college job. lunch break is the best part of the job sadly to say. over worked and under paid.
good,As a whole Target Co. Is is a nice company to work for. I just feel that the particular location I was employed at there wasn't good management. Everyone was cliques  and it was very hard to come together and work towards a better store because of that. The best thing about working there was meeting so many new people. Because I was a cashier I always came in contact with new people.Target Co. Is great just NOT the Mount Vernon Location!!!!!
good,My job consisted of me performing at an acceptable pace in getting customers through the check out line. I also had to keep the front end clean and neat. There were times where I may have been called onto the floor to help restock some items.
good,"Here I was a team member. Assisting guests with questions & products. Although, I did enjoy the hustle when it was busy, the slow times were mind numbing. I enjoy my office environments but, will always do what it takes to get the job done & done right."
good,"A typical day at Target Cafe would be fast fun and friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job was, when the guest would be to smile at my service and i have made there day. Some of the managers at Target would come up with games at end of day: How many M&M are the jar, How much is the gift basket worth, what state is known for what. I think competition is great for  work place to get the people going."
good,I learned a lot in this job. I love my job everybody is nice to me but the sales are going down so much that they don't give you enough hour per schedule.This is the perfect place if you are looking for a part time job.
good,"Each store is different, some store will treat you like trash and others won't it all depends how they like the Target Mobile department"
good,Very fast paste work. Always busy busy busy. I learned a lot of duties and job related experience. The management was some what decent. The co-workers were awesome. Hardest part was waking up super early.
good,"A typical day as a cross trained Cart attendant cashier means I take on lots of duties, the majority of my days at work go by very well especially after 8pm. Working at Target has improved on my skills as a cashier as well as on my customer service experience. The management for the most part are very fun and easy to talk to. My co-workers are awesome we all clicked since my first day, mostly due to my outgoing, humorous, and talkative personality. The most stress from the job comes when the summer days are at their hottest being that my job asks of me to retrieve shopping carts from outside. The most enjoyable part is quitting time."
good,good first job. Not somewhere i would want to stay for more than a year or two.
good,i work their in winter. it was a seasonal job for extra money.
good,Guest and sales driven environment with key focuses being managing poor performers and multitasking. 
good,A fun atmosphere to start but that fun wears out with inconsistent work hours; and managers with god-complexes
good,i tried every job i could in my dept. i packed  did any thing i was ask to do i wanted to learn it all even to answering the phones i trained new hires co worker were great  we worked in teams in the packing stations   
good,There are good days and bad days working there. The managers are ok to speak to. The customer service isn't as Happy going as I thought it would be. the people working that station are rude.
good,The management treat their workers well and the benefits are great.
good,"good company to work for "
good,Its up to you and your team to make the best of everything. It has its ups and downs but its a job
good,Had good vibe to the store but when I gave them  1 month's notice that I would be moving to Henrietta (they said they would help me transfer) they didn't do anything. Some bosses were un-reliable in the fact if you asked for help they would badger you about why didn't you know that instead of helping you out with the problem and saving time. 
good,"The company had good ideas, but left no room in the process for growth or change"
good,"Usually, i managed about 10-15 people to helpl maintain a high level of customer service."
good,"I was expected to complete the inventory of price change daily even though there was not enough help alot of times. Although I believe that a quality work is essential, when there isn't enough time to go back and double check the work, I would get the blame when there's an error or overlook. I was told occasionally that I was not fast enough scanning the merchandise. Management do not listen when I explain reasons of any kind."
good,"Target is an okay job it's not one that i am willing or want to do again, but non the less it was a job and i take my job and responsibility serious."
good,"Not the Fast, Fun & Friendly place to work that they aspire to be."
good,I folded clothes and straitened up clothing sections. It was fine for what it was.
good,"-cashiering, customer service"
good,"All functions related to human resources including benefit administration, performance management, recruiting, training, and staff development. Resolving employee relation issues and addressing employee needs promptly."
good,"Target is great if you're part of management or if you work at one of Target's HQ's. As a cashier though, target could vastly improve. I've had much experience in grocery and retail, those of which are combined in one place at the Target stores. Yet, my starting pay was that of an entry level cashier. Which I am not. There were many things told to me and promised to me by different members of management, even starting from the interviewing process, that they never came through on. They also seem to be (for lack of a better word) ""suspect"" when it comes to hiring their Guest Service Team Leads. Many of the GSTL's that came into the two stores I worked at were hired from outside of the store, with no previous grocery or retail experience what-so-ever; even with people that had been working there for 10+ years also vying for the position. I had to help train in at least 2 GSTL's, which baffles me when they're supposed to be my manager."
good,People are friendly but there's way too much preference from management.
good,Giving good customer service and keeping the customer happy so that they will be happy to return to the store is what my job involves
good,"A typical day consists of assisting guests in the electronics center, converting walk by guests into mobile phone customers. Cash management as well as inventory management on a daily basis. I learned several knew approaches to generate sales with very little advertisement. Gained experience managing a business. Developed crutial interviewing tactics to hire the best candidates. Upper management was unreliable and very untruthful, making false promises, holding contests only to refuse awarding prizes to contest winners. The hardest part of this job was maintaining a strong sales team while upper management continually failed to provide any type of guidance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of achievement when producing extraordinary sales results and building an incredibly strong sales team with such little guidance."
good,"work was long and pay was not so great. management at the time was very poor, unwilling to help and poor attitude."
good,"Clock in , Start working so you won't get behind. I learned to work very fast in a fast paced retail enviornment. The management was okay for the most part . Most of my co-workers were like me , Part time workers . The hardest part of my job there at Target was picking up everybody elses slack ! And the most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out."
good,"help cash out customers in a timely fashion and cash handled, and kept the store well kept for customers who shopped there"
good,I got told many lies and lots of disrespect. I enjoyed working in the pharmacy but the Starbucks was like nothing I ever want to experience ever again.
good,Hardest part of this job was dealing w/ customer service issues that management did not agree w/.
good,"To work at 4 and first unloading the freight truck, then unpacking boxes and stocking shelves before specific times. Physically taxing job and unfriendly management. It also never seemed right to take a lunch break at 8 a.m."
good,Product knowledge of electronics to perspective consumers
good,Surrounded by productive team members who I could learn different things from as far as the work performance goes. The hardest part about my job was communicating to management. An the most enjoyable part of working there was the people that I met while I was there.
good,"At first I really enjoyed working at Target. I worked hard and thought that would be seen as a good thing. They ended up overworking me, not taking my school schedule into account, they kept changing my work schedule on short notice, not giving rewards or fulfilling promises. In short they took a huge advantage of me but the 10% discount was the only perk."
good,"Maintain a clean and neat floor, provide fast fun and friendly guest service, and respond to help alerts for checkout lanes, restock the apparel floor. What I enjoyed the most about this position was the opportunity to learn several aspects of the store well a general office duties as assigned"
good,"Although Target is great when it comes to sales and shopping, I had less then a favorable experiance working there. From long hours and being forced to work shifts that were absolutely unheard of at the end of the day I felt that no matter how much effort I put into this company unless I knew the right people I would be let go."
good,"Hours working were subject to change, felt as if I was a child being bribed (with Candy) to get customers to apply for their Red Credit card."
good,"A typical day was putting up inventory, setting up new displays, putting away clothes and also organizing racks. Management was not well organized, the employees were not very friendly. And the whole store was not managed well at all."
good,Fast paced.
good,unstable work hours that vary from week to week
good,"I have learned from this job that people some time can take advantage of you if you don't address the issue to management. For example; Working too hard, some time, is not enough to be considered for advancement. In another words, learning and working at the same time is a advisable otherwise you get stuck with the daily routine then you lose sense of progress and productive. I believe every one is trying to be presented as good employee to their bosses in a way or another but I respect who does his/her job in ethical manner at the same time open to other work possibilities and opportunities. However, the job world is not always perfect but we try to make better place for every one."
good,"A typical day at work for myself would be opening or closing the electronics department. Assisting guest with their daily and individual needs. I've learned that a customer will pay more $ when they know the value of the particular item. Management on the other hand I rarely would see on the sales floor. They spent most of their time in the offices. In my opinion, they did not lead by example. My peers always performed their job more so when short staffed. The job was not enjoyable. Not after new management was transferred and cut everyone down to part time. Some to 4 hours per week forcing multiple people to quit. There is no opportunity for advancement and no chance what so ever for full time hours"
good,What can I say? Just google i hate target. You'll come to a website that has actually been made by EMPLOYEES. There is really nothing left to say about the company.
good,"Fun environment if you like customer service. Enjoyed interacting with the customers, easy work."
good,"What can I say, it was a job, the pay was not equivalent to the workload and the management was careless and did little to make the experience productive"
good,Worked you very hard and had to be quick which meant many people were hurt or did not want to work forcing others to take on their work load. People were great to work with and the money and benefits were top notch.
good,"I worked on the truck, I sorted clothes, and stocked. Management was ok, they worked sometime. The work was hard but I enjoyed every minute of it."
good,"a typical day consists of heavy work loads, team work and daily quotas to meet. I've learned the importance of team work, dedication and drive on the job. The management overall was very hard working and made sure work loads were finished on time. The hardest part of the job was training yourself on company policies and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out!"
good,"When working at Target I didnt feel appreciated. They did not accommodate my work schedule to meet my home needs. I am a single mother without daycare and I notified them in advance for my schedule changes and they kept denying them. No matter the situation or emergency status, they felt that they were more important than your own life. Also the pay is not worth all the work you do. You have a ton of work to do and a small fee to do it."
good,Very busy job your work is non stop but the people there were very nice.They hire so many that they cut hours ALLthe time people have bills to pay they cant pay them off of 10hrs a week.
good,the hardest part of the job is dealing with some of the guest rude attitudes. the most enjoyable part is satisfying the guest and fulfilling their needs. sometimes in the break room their would be games going on for the month of a holiday lunch provided. at the end of the month their are birthday cupcakes.
good,"It is an easy and productive to be a part of and work for, but needs major help with the culture and the core fundamentals in it's brand"
good,"only hire cashiers part time ,if you want more hours you have to trade days with other employees, not easy to advance into management."
good,Target was an ok job to have while in high school but sometimes they didnt understand I was in school and would work extremely late hours.
good,cashier an floor sales is something i like to do becase i like working with people.
good,"Good atmosphere, always something to do, competitive work place. Terrible management."
good,"Nothing to disclose. Currently still employed with the company. It strives to develop team members and that is highly appreciated. However, management needs to be good otherwise its demoralizing"
good,"The presentation team was mostly great to work with, however, several other team members were unproductive and often shown favoritism by management.  The favoritism was also departmental.  The playing field was not level with respect to promotions either.  Those who were in management positions often were not qualified.  They did not know how to manage, did not have good people skills and did not have a good understanding of the operations of all depts or the store as a whole.  Overall, team members are very underpaid for the amount of work expected and politics that were present.  The management, especially executive level, are very overpaid for their skills, knowledge and abilities.  The benefits are decent - health, dental, 401K & employee discount."
good,target helped shape what i see as starter retail job and what it should entail along with the needed tasks and goals to create a smooth flowing workday.
good,"During my seasonal position at target, I've both enjoyed my job, as well as disliked the energy in the workplace at times. The general store manager was rude to most of her employees as well as the assistant store manager. Some managers need to realize that to work as a team, you don't have to be so hard on your employees."
good,"I work performing a great deal of front end task and duties (e.g. guest service, guest service assistant, etc.)  The titles, tasks and duties are overworked and underpaid."
good,I worked there for about a year. People there just didn’t seem very welcoming I would ask questions and sometimes they wouldn’t answer and I would just be ignored.
good,"The job was unbelievably boring. If no one was there there was nothing to do. Management horrifically unhelpful, if there was a problem they'd often ignore you before actually coming to help. The team also lied to me when I asked for a transfer to go to school, telling me there was none open in the area I was moving to, but there in fact was. Pay was very good but almost not worth it for the toxic work culture."
good,Starting at Target was great. Everything was laid out plain and simple. Once promoted things started to feel very unorganized. Rollouts were happening before they were perfected and nothing ever went as planned.
good,"Target provided me with a needed temporary position when I was out of work.  Management worked hard to speak positively about the store and the team.  However training was sporadic and often inadequate.  There was little flexibility in schedule after you set your availability.  Store was chronically understaffed, resulting in a lot of frustration between departments."
good,"Target is a solid employer and the training is outstanding "
good,"Target has great benefits and the discounts are good. The store and company leadership is where they fall short. There is no communication, no support, no follow through. It’s a large company, and like most large companies, they care far more about their profits than they do about their employees. Promotions are all but impossible unless you’re “involved” with someone higher up. Seasonal employees will get hired at a better pay rate than people who have been with the company for years. The schedule is horribly inconsistent, and they are constantly adding more responsibilities to the team members without any extra compensation or benefits. I cannot speak for all the team members in every store, but this has been my experience for the last two years at my store."
good,"For a first job, it was a good start. The managers only helped when you asked or needed something. Most of the time the managers and employees kept to themselves unless they were close with each other."
good,"There was a lack of diversity in the higher positions, and a lot of random hour cuts! It was a great job, that taught me so much. After 8 years I can't afford hours to be cut down!"
good,"Target used to be a fun place to work,  Everyone worked together as a team.  Now no one works together.  The executive team used to work with the team members and team leaders they no longer do."
good,Overall it was fine working at target. I felt that there was a lot of favoritism when it came to coaching. I felt some people got off on a lot while others did not even when it was similar actions. But other than that I felt like I was able to do my job and be professional.
good,Target does not train its employees very well. They train you one day  then assume that you know what you’re doing. They also have lack of communication
good,Bad vibes from management who can't schedule you within your availability. Left before having to tell them a FOURTH time I could not work a certain time. Unfortunately the team leader I worked under was rude to me since day one.
good,"I enjoyed working for Target. However, I would recommend not working there during their holiday season. The management is extremely rude during this time and they do not care about anyone."
good,"At Target, they make their goals clear but do not give all the necessary tools to accomplish the task at hand. They have unrealistic expectations, and admit, that in meetings. They want things done in a unrealistic time frame and will sacrifice other peoples jobs and areas of work to get a small task done if they determine it is most important."
good,"Yes, good pay per hour, but they chopped hours recently to 25 hours or less. They say it's a good thing, but no one can afford to live on part time hours only."
good,"Target is a great place to work short term. There are a lot of benefits to staying longer but after the first year they will cut your hours. Example, my first holiday they were giving me over 35 hrs a week. This holiday I haven’t been scheduled even a solid 20. So not only am I getting under 20 hrs but they’ll schedule me to clopen (close night and open the next morning.) You’re also required to be fully available Saturday and Sunday which leaves very little room for a second job. If they didn’t pay more than the average retail job I wouldn’t stay, but I’ve got to keep the roof over my head. This is how most employees feel and they always talk about leaving until they eventually do. Managers will nit pick on you during the slow season but when they need your help training everyone for holiday they let things slide. Sure enough they’ll bring it up once the seasonal people are gone. Everyone in management is on a power trip."
good,If you dislike getting yelled at by random people or your manger getting annoyed by ur mistakes than don’t work at target the manger was awful he was disrespectful to team members
good,"I left Target because the work to life balance is a problem. While a loved the people that I worked with, the senior leadership creates a culture of fear and unrealistic expectations."
good,"Overall not a bad work experience, management is typically left winged so they can be biased towards an employee based on political views, fast paced, expected to work more hours than you are scheduled. If you are done in your area then you are expected to go to a coworkers area and help them finish."
good,"I have worked in multiple markets, one was a great experience...one was not so great.  It mainly has to do with what kind of leadership you are under."
good,"I was in the ship-from-store department. I received a fair bit of education as to how to do my job, so that was nice. It didn't seem like anyone was interested in what they did or smiled, though."
good,"Compared to most jobs in the Savannah/Pooler/Midway area the pay is above average. Better than any other warehouse job with the exception of Walmart (I believe the pay is roughly the same). The work is physical, you will spend twelve hours on your feet moving boxes that way anywhere from 5 to 75lbs ( team lift exceeds this but you are supposed to lift with more than one person). The company sets carton per hour goals that are not realistic and you will be held to this standard regardless of what goes on around you. To meet these goals you will have to sacrifice safety,  whether it's from lifting above your head, not using the power position, not team lifting, etc. There is a lot of turnover from upper management down to hourly employees. Each new General Manager, Senior Ops Manager, Ops Manager bring a new, poorly thought out system that makes your day more difficult. With each change it just gets worse. Due to the physical nature of the job it comes with an expiration date, and while I would recommend it, I would only suggest it if you are really in need of a job with decent pay for a brief period of time."
good,"Working in softlines is not that hard, we push truck, look at the previous sales, do one to ones, zone, its not challenging. Of corse i go in with previous experience but i took the job for a challenge. This is a great first job.. not a third job.."
good,worked their for seasonal was let go because they didn't have enough equipment so when asked for things by costumers would need to leave my station to help
good,"I do my training for the week then pull back stock work it to the floor. Then I assess the department. I receive, work out , and back stock freight. I do any price changes and clearance items. Then I work out any floor revisions that need to be done. Through the day I interact with the guests and consult them on their beauty needs thus ""filling their basket""."
good,"This was my first job in high school and I staid there for 8 years. They are very good at encouraging you to keep moving up the management ladder, but they will not be honest when they will not move you up anymore. I worked my way from a Team Member to a Team Leader then a Senior Team Leader and was told my next step would be an Executive Team Leader. Well after interviews were ""postponed"" for months, I was told that they had a hiring freeze on new Executive Leaders. However, they continued hiring outside the company instead of promoting internally. So that was the push I needed to finally leave."
good,its kool the customer are laid back unlike Walmart so that is a plus but what is not a plus is the fact that they basically force you to get a certain amount of red card approvals and if you don't get any because not everyone wants the darn card they will threaten your job
good,"Busy, With impossible goals set by management to obtain. can be fun at times but deals with a lot of drama on both sides of the coin. All in all its a place for a certain kind of employee"
good,"The business plan change that Target has implemented into effect has many team members stressed and confused as more responsibility is put on one individual instead of a specialized team. There is also too much product and a lack of storage which leads to overcrowded back rooms, falling hazards (with product and pallet placements), and also a lack of communication among leaders that bundles the whole thing into one big mess."
good,Was setup to be good but targeting and management abuse lead me out the door. Loved the work. Hated the costumer disregard and consumers atmosphere. Blaa.
good,"This job would be best as a supplement for another job. While you may need to be ""available"" almost everyday of the week, the work is part-time in stores. You are looking at 40 hours or less a week, so there is room to take another job to make more money."
good,"Everyone I worked with, with the exception of management, was warm, welcoming and wonderful people. They made the job worth it. The actual work was extreme tedious and they wanted us to go faster then I personally think was needed. They also had a very bad inventory system, having to many things being put on the selves while other things where not to be found."
good,The food service department is a nightmare. I was bullied every day that I went in to work and most days I would come home and cry. Me and a co-worker of mine had to quit for our mental health.
good,I left the company a few months after they rolled out a new unload process. Not only were the TIMED pack-out goals unreasonable but they also expected us to provide customer service while we were unloading/packing out the product despite the fact that there were associate hired specifically for that job. That's not to say that I didn't mind helping the customers I just thought it was unfair that I was being timed to pack-out a cart of product while expected to take time to help a customer in need. (My manager didn't take that into consideration.)
good,Target is a friendly place to work. The guest are great. Being able to multitask is a must. They encourage empowerment. Managment likes to see teammates resolving problems.
good,Target is a store but it is not for my career. I like to work in my field and I love the computer. I know the computer very well. You cannot be disappointed if you hire me.
good,"If your schedule is open and you don’t have much going on in your everyday life (school, other jobs, family), then, you’ll get excellent hours! If you do have those things then I would not recommend Target. The pay is good. The benefits are good, hours and stress are not worth it in my opinion."
good,Not enough communication. Not enough support in inner management. No work life balance. Night team separated from day activities. People treated poorly and like a high school with adults in management
good,"I was at Target Mobile which is inside Target but, not employed by Target.  The pay at first was great but, every year the commission on the sales was decreased and cut."
good,"Overall, the experience was pretty good. We were unable to work out some scheduling conflicts and other personal issues. If we could have found a solution I probably would have stayed."
good,Corporate choices have caused managers to stop caring about their employees in fear of their own jobs. The atmosphere is that of a highschool. Everyone acts like everyone else is incompetent.
good,"Worked there for a very long time.  Learned a lot about being a leader when it came to what and what not to do.  After working there for a certain amount of time you are eligible for good medical benefits, including 401K, etc."
good,"HORRIBLE!!!! Very unorganized atmosphere. Have you working 4-5 hours a day. 20 different task to be completed when you have other stuff to do!!!!!!!!! very stressful environment that makes your life not easier. if u wanna woke here be a cashier"
good,Good company overall. Management can be a hit or miss. Depending on which location you apply to.Work culture is great but like mention it depends if you have a good and passionate leader in charge.
good,"I love the idea of my job at Target.  I love my team and the environment.  However, with the recent changes the work life balance has disappeared completely because the expectations are extremely high.  I have no problem with high expectations and working hard, but the leadership in the building is key and that is why I hate it now.  The hardest part of the job is managing the time needed for all the tasks that need to get done with limited resources."
good,"Target employs a wide variety of people. I found out that fast learners with a good work ethic are often tasked more than employees who just float through their day. Even though this is a plus if you enjoy staying busy, I often found myself picking up the slack of some other workers, and managers demanding more from me than was possible to accomplish in a standard shift."
good,A starting wage of $13/hr is great until you realize the people who have been working for Target for 5+ years are also making $13/hr. All the guest comment cards and red cards in the world don’t mean anything if you’re not friends with management.
good,"My experience with Target was not the best, my department was undermanaged for the first half of my employment, and as a result it was also understaffed. I did learn about cafe guidelines and rules, but was not able to cross train in other departments."
good,Target is a great place for a first time employment. The only problem Ive had is recently. Hours have been cut and cut again lower and lower I cant afford to live off them.
good,"The management doesn't help on the floor when needed the most. Also, they expect more from you and work you like a full-time employee when you are just part-time. Your fellow co-workers are amazing and awesome to work with. The only good thing about working here is the fact that I got discounts on top of discounts for all the merchandise in the store. I had to leave because of the favoritism and the lack of compassion for others from management. I would never go back to this particular store again to work unless there is an entirely new management team."
good,"Target can be a great place to work for college students who need the experience. The culture there is good. It's like a second family. "
good,Fast paced at times. Its an easy job for someone who has no experience. It sucked if you wanted to advance in your career but didn't have the right look.
good,You don't understand what it is like to work here until you get here. There are endless amounts of tasks to complete. You begin to feel under appreciated because the work you have completed seems to get unnoticed. The guests are reckless and can drive you up a wall. There's a lack of courtesy from the guest as you try to make the store presentable. This job definitely requires a lot of patience.
good,Quick paced environment with readiness to learn be great with customer service skills and understanding of what customers need. Hours are flexible management understanding to a point
good,"Constantly revolving management.  Overwhelmed, understaffed. The Orland store sometimes staffed 6-8 people including cashiers for the entire store so it was constantly being robbed, theft in electronics and clothing was extremely prevalent. Didn't feel safe at night as security gets off at 8 pm and stores open until 11."
good,"The work itself was enjoyable, however higher up management was lacking and made me and coworkers less likely to enjoy what we were doing. The saying, ""People don't quit jobs, they quit managers"" is highly true in this situation as I saw many people love working there but could not deal with management anymore."
good,I would work at Target again but as a cashier only. Just be on time with a great attitude. It also helps increase your chances of being offered full timeora oermanent position.beingoffered full timeor acperma
good,"When I first started at Target, I had mostly positive experiences. However, the modernization changes have negatively impacted the workplace environment to the point where I don't feel like I'm working the same job anymore."
good,Would have been nice to have a work life balance or room for advancement. Good for teenagers or college students. Not the best management but can tell they are doing their best
good,"Pay was great, management was not. My immediate manager very much,liked to play favorite with the employees. If you were not her buddy buddy you would end up with the worst jobs."
good,The management at most locations have the inside advantage having had been either hired or promoted directly from friends and people they're close with. It's terrible in terms of management and there's not much supervision outside of store. I worked through multiple locations and occasionally saw how numerous stores were in the same predicament; terrible management.
good,It’s ok I guess you only get a 10% discount and the popcorn is wonderful and it’s clean the enjoyable part is going home some of the employees are nice and friendly
good,Good place to start. Provided me with a lot of experience to move into multiple facets of my life. There was good opportunities to advance and move forward.
good,"Didn’t care for the management "
good,very stressful job always coming up with ides making you try them when they don't work you get written up and then they change the ideas sooo stressful
good,"Pros:  Target's image, compensation, and promise will always attract the best of the best.  So you will be surrounded by some brilliant people that will raise your game and push you to excel.  "
good,"If you are looking for a fast paced job, then target is a good place to work. You must be ready to take on challenges and overcome obstacles that will be handed to you."
good,The environment is relaxed and clean. The way everything is set up makes it easy to find the items that my customers ordered. The area that I work in is relatively new so is a bit over crowded and packed most of the time.
good,Unloaded the truck and once the truck was empty went to the sales floor and stocked shelves.  Very fast paced there was no such thing as too fast especially when it came to unloading the truck.
good,"The typical day at work is overseeing the set up of the salesfloor, Monthly we recieve our workload broken down weekly by department my team sets the shelves up to remove out dated products and put out the new items and update areas given time of year. Two weeks out I plan sets for my team and make the schedule to reflect."
good,"Always stocking and making sure everything looks nice"
good,This was a good job to get started. However management seemed to have shown a lot of favoritism. Scheduling was inconsistent. Rarely any room to move up.
good,"I enjoy the Guest and like talking with them. Co-workers are also nice and friendly. They lack in supervision from the top down. No directions with different management, not consistant."
good,"Ok, above average pay in most states, not many opportunities for advancement, lots of changes to structure of the company and how things are run in the past year"
good,"*Fast pace day"
good,"Fellow co-workers were generally pleasant to work with, company culture however quickly was obviously being driven heavily by numbers/spreadsheet scoring.  At the end of the day, a business needs to be profitable, but the lack of forward thinking devoted to properly investing in your workforce lead to a natural turnover."
good,"At the end stress hard built up immeasurably from when I had started. Number of employees was way less and a lot more was expected of you. Tired out extremely."
good,"Because I was hired right before the holiday season (Q4) training was pushed to the back of the priority list for me. Which I was cool with initially. Once Q1 hit, again I still wasn’t being trained effectively or efficiently to perform my job to the highest of my abilities. I kept asking upper management for proper training. Which I was never given. I was fired for speaking my mind and challenging upper management"
good,"Take sides and judge before seeing a persons work. (Management)"
good,"The days off are terrible, there's been six days of work and it's stressful sometimes. The hours change a lot and the staff have poor communication skills. Also the supervisors are highly expective."
good,"There are reasons to work at Target, and there are reasons not to.  If you are looking for a career, it is an unlikely place for you. However, the people who do advance within the Target corporation are usually the type of people who don't seem to know exactly what to do with their life.  The pay is minimum and the corporate culture wants more results with less hours, so there is always that to deal with.  However, management is almost always right next to you doing the extra work, and the place is so busy there is little to no time for drama, so most people just ending up being friends."
good,"Working for target overall was a great experience, I learned how to work conveyor belts access the computer,and how to successfully manage packing and shipping to the proper location. The hardest part of my jb was just adapting and mastering every single station that they provide. There was no room to get comfortable anywhere. The most enjoyable part was the experience i gained while working with target"
good,"Store is entirely run by liberal soccer moms. They're actually very polite and well meaning, but the employees rights are trampled on for the sake of the ""Guest"" always being right. And when you work in electronics, the guest is often wrong."
good,"The management at my Target was not the best because when we needed the managers for something they were never around. My guests would start to be impatient and want to take things to corporate.  When they were out on the floor, they never seem to be actually working, either on the phone, talking to others like they weren't working."
good,"Loss prevention for the company was a great learning experience. However the overall managenent and treatment of other employees in the store was terrible. Employees were belittled and seen as outsiders if they were not part of the store directors ""clique."""
good,When on the clock there is always someone that needs help or an aisle to be zoned. all the other employees are very friendly and all have the same goal in mind.
good,"Overall target is not a bad job, most of the time you will have a little bit more of a load you can handle, They also expect it to be done in a short amount of time, and with the amount of things you have to stock sometimes its unrealistic."
good,My job consist of unloading trucks and putting up freight I also helped the pricing team as well as the decorating team I  learned a lot over night about the process and structure
good,"They say they’ll give you hours but they won’t. None of the managers ever really seem to understand what’s happening or what the plan is, lots of barking out instructions with no clear message."
good,"Got hired for seasonal overnight stock. After a month was training new people. Some nights worked all night, others sent home early. Got laid off on Christmas Eve."
good,"You show up to work, and the company is so unorganized they wont even realize if you sit around doing nothing all day, which most of the employees did, and then left all of the work at the end of the night for someone else to clean up. Management loves to gossip and walk around doing nothing. The only decent thing about the job was the pay, and break time."
good,"Unload the truck, put freight away and help with customer service. I haven't worked there long. But so far it is good and I enjoy the people I work with."
good,They dont rehire. I was lied on by a team leader because whe felt like i was coming for her job so she felt threaten ed.i was not treated fairly .i was forced to quit.my working enviroment became to hostile.
good,"They have there clicks. If you are not a friend or management. Don't expect to stay on. Managers do nothing but stand around."
good,It was an ok environment but there were a few things the store needed to work on like communication and working with others to best make the store's overall experience better.
good,"I do enjoy this job. For the most it is a good work environment. For the most part my schedule is consistent. I know which days I am most likely to work and the days that I am off. They do work with my availability, as well as being understanding when family emergencies or sickness comes up. The first drawback is working every Saturday. The only time that I am off on a Saturday is if I am deathly ill or ask off. Another drawback is that the new hires have been receiving more hours than people that have been there much longer. New hires come in making the same amount as people with longer experience; there is no differentiation in wages besides people that have tenure. Third, they pride themselves on hiring within, yet here recently that has yet to happen."
good,"It was alright, I worked in the food court so i wouldn't really get too many customers. VERY very slow and not a ton to do. People were alright,maybe a little too competitive though."
good,"the most enjoyable part o my job is working with our guests, also the flexibility was key for m in order to get my children back and forth to school. not enough recognition"
good,"The job atmosphere is almost toxic with seniority having extreme command and right-of-way, within its own workers cliches and hierarchy forms and just puts everyone under stress. No single management was able to not take out their stresses on their employees. Target has a creepy requirement that you use their bank. expect a cut-throat attitude towards job advancement and overtime."
good,Working at Target first starts off with a honeymoon stage everyone is typically friendly and easy to get a long with. I would recommend it for college students/ high school students who are just looking for a temporary PART-TIME job they can come in get work done and get paid for it. I wouldn't recommend it as a career as there’s typically a lot of drama between “teams” and different cliches plus management can be shady and two faced sometimes. Theres A LOT of favoritism that goes alongside scheduling. Typically people they need to keep things a float they will keep on schedule and generally give hours too until they don’t need them anymore. The structure of the store constantly changes and its as if corporate is out of touch with how the store works systematically on a day to day basis. New methods and changes usually cause more problems but higher ups will never admit that or drawback to previous methods so your usually stuck dealing with them. Target is in a position where they are trying to refine and define themselves moving forward but it’s as if they forgot all about the employees and flow of the store for the guests experience truthfully they are more worried about the budget they spend and hours they give than the task that need to be completed and they honestly could care less as long as payroll and hours are meeting corporates criteria. Guest throughout the store complain about half pushed merchandise laying on store push vehicles throughout the store as employees aren’t typically scheduled enough hours for the workload there expected to carryout and usually its only
good,Good place to work. Good leadership. No potential growth in pay or job placement. Promotions come from the outside of the company rather than from within.
good,It was a part time job as cashier.  Also helped restock after store hours.  Cleaned toilets which was terrible.  Enjoyed providing good customer service.
good,the hardest part of the job is getting everything done with the little time they give you. they don't really appreciate what you do. they only see what you dont do.
good,I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone I know because they wouldn’t be able to afford working there and the management isn’t right for the place it’s more like a circle of friends.
good,"Your experience at Target will depend entirely on your management team. It was a great time with the management team I started out with but after a lot of them moved around not as much. I did learn a lot of solid entry level skills with them though. Everyone is expected to work quickly and sometimes the workload can be unreasonable, some managers are open to feedback about it while others are not. The pay is good and hours are usually reasonable but the work and life balance is very poor. Would recommend Target for someone who needs a bit of extra income but not as a full time career."
good,Working here was alright but our manager was a rude and unprofessional. She fired my good friend right in front of me and when he left the room she told a lie that he was gonna attack her even though i saw with my own eyes nothing like that happened. There are a bunch of fake people who work there. Overall i did enjoy working at Target until they started to fire workers just because they talked back. I met great co workers and we enjoyed our time working with each other.
good,Worked electronics. Your LoDs will try and better their own departments so be prepared to be given 2 or 3 task from 2 different managers. Stay vocal with management and let them know your task. Management at my location was okay but they are all very fake when it comes to handling employees. The management is very corporate driven so they will always have the company’s interest in mind over employees. Workload is about normal for a retail job.
good,"I worked at this company for at least 4 years while I was in college. I do have to say they were flexible with my schedule so I could attend classes. "
good,"As time goes by you earn raises, afyter some time goes by they start cutting your hours.  They want you to do more then 8 hours of work in less then 6 hours of time"
good,"cut hours dramatically without warning"
good,"I was a Guest Service Team Lead. Irregular shifts. Sometimes ""Clopening"" shifts if our not careful on watching the schedule to vet hr dept. mistakes. Big on REDcard promotion however I do now notice employees are not under as much pressure as I the past, to push for REDcard applications/sales."
good,It is good as a fist job but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone looking for a career there is almost no chance of moving up and there really is no benefits
good,"The specific one I worked at was terrible. We had 6 managers and they would normally get fired for misconduct and then they'd get replaced, so you never knew who to report to. I was working well and getting good hours but I had a manager who didn't like me. She told me I didn't have the right ""look"" for target. One day she asked me to stay after my shift but I was a student and I had to go to class. So the next couple months after she gave me two hours every two weeks which sucked. I worked as head of the fitting room, cashier because people had always quit, and softlines sales floor employee. People I worked with were super nice, but managers used to fight in the break room, super scary. I'm sure not every location was like the one I worked it, I heard its improved after the fired the manager that didn't like me."
good,Daily duties were to unload freight off the trucks brought in daily. we averaged 3-4 trucks a day per line (conveyor belt) with a total of 4 lines. Some days we had to unload each trailer by hand start to finish
good,"Over the years I worked on the sales floor in different areas keeping the merchandise straight and stocking selfs, I was manager over HBA for 8 months then i moved to service desk where i trained all incoming cashiers and service desk members. The last job I had there was at the food service area/pizza hut "
good,"Been with Target for two years, I relocated from one store to another and was treated with the same lazy management as the other store."
good,"13.25 an hour is an amazing amout, except when you only get 15-20 hours a week.  Getting hours is like pulling teeth.  They also will refuse to schedule more than one person in electronics, so you'll mostly be trapped there."
good,"The target I worked for was clean and most co-workers were pleasant. Store lead (who no longer works at this location) and head of HR were jerks to say the least. They weren't honest and would lie to cover up for themselves. If you are anything below an LOD they basically don't care about you or your job. I used to work in the front end and the GSTL was rude, manipulative, and so passive aggressive it was ridiculous.  I digress. Target as a company is okay but ask around about the management. I had a terrible experience with my management and I dont think I would work for a target again because of that."
good,"Target was a very friendly place to work. Fast paced, if it was not just seasonal I would have loved to work there full time. They were great to work with."
good,"Management needs some work, the job expectations aren't realistic. This is more of a part-time job, this job isn't worth keeping for life, holidays are the best time to make your money.."
good,"It was quite a while ago and I don't really remember management, but I do remember that the atmosphere there was positive and I did have good time. Too bad they went bankrupt in Canada and they moved out."
good,"Just a side job, low pay in retail."
good,"Day to day, your job changes. You cold change within the same department, but on days the store is short you'll be moved around the store. Some days are more stressful than others, resulting in different work paces and different routines. I learned how to better interact with a customer, sell an item, operate the phone, do announcements, fold clothing rapidly, manage my time, and speak up when I felt something was wrong. Management wasn't the best. They chose favorites and treated others differently. They also failed to listen to any concerns or requests made by employees. The culture was very diverse and inviting. The hardest part of the job was finishing everything on your own on days the store is short staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting a smile on a guests' face."
good,"the work environment was overall good, however we were expected to do so much in a very short amount of time, leads would get mad if we didn't finish. Everyone is expected to do too much then what they are capable on an average shift"
good,"Really to sum up my whole target experience, since management was slowly changing everything to create a much ""more easier work experience"", it was unorganized, hard to get help and was demanding of work for one person.  The biggest issue was the limited training, and no chances of full time positions. I was partially trained in one department after being told that I was going to a new department, just to remain in my original department with no answers for being trained in an area that I wasn't going to be in."
good,"It fair for an enerty level, but recently the issue have been with upper mangament. The chane in target causing many of the emoplies to search at company"
good,"Target is an OK place to work but it is mainly for younger people who needs some money in their pockets. More mature adults can't make a living and support a household on the salary. A typical day is meeting and greeting customers, folding and refolding clothes and moving stock. What you learn from the job is patience and you try to have determination to sustain yourself. Management is so so, You are mainly managed by younger people. The hardest part of the job is repetition of folding the same things over and over. The most enjoyable part is helping customers."
good,"If management left you alone then overall the work is easy. The management at the location I worked at however was rude, overbearing, and more concerned with social standings among each other than the store. "
good,"this is a nice place to work. the management does good job of managing thing here, but this is a very small target comparing to the other ones around. Most of the products are limited."
good,Target is somewhat a good working place if you're teen or have no bills to pay. They barely give you hours or many options schedule ability. thats how I feel working in target.
good,The hours we get are never consistent so if you have bills to pay and you only work 18 hours a week things can get tight depending on what time of year it is.
good,Target is your usual run of the mill retail. Not enough pay or hours. A lot of empty promises. I would recommend looking for alternatives or non retail jobs.
good,Constant changes meant that you could never feel secure in that you had a job from one period to the next.  Culture constantly shifting and no one at any level seemed to have any real answers.
good,"When I first started working for target, I started out as a ""seasonal"" employee. Then I was told that I'd be staying on as a regular employee.  Awesome!  I then started to see little things that I'd point out & management didn't like that.  For instance, in the store I worked in, if you're a female you had it made.  There was a girl that I worked with who constantly was written up by guests and she would call out at least TWO shifts per week.  Yet, there were male employee's that would call out once in a six month period & it would be pointed out to them like ""Hey, just so you know make sure if you call out that you're actually sick because we don't like our employee's to call out if you're not sick!!""  Seriously?  Also, there are a few of the younger cute females that are the laziest people I've ever seen, yet they could do anything they wanted because the upper management (males) would let them get away without doing anything.  That would create animosity & management couldn't understand why!!! "
good,Originally I loved working here. But after four years and changes in Management and policies things have fallen apart. Management talks down to team members and there are ZERO opportunities for growth within the company as they have started hiring from outside rather than promoting from within. Would not recommend.
good,Target had some of the worst mangers I've worked with as well as employees and cuts corners. The days were hard for the little money I was making although they did give you an hour extra for over nighter. Ultimately if you have to work for target try and work in the day time as they actually treat you like a human.
good,"The management was poor, and the employees were worse. I was a college student as well, so when they schedule me these unreasonable hours after I told them I couldn't do it I to go"
good,"Yuba City Target is a fun place to work.  I would work there again, if necessary.  However, the salary is very low.  Hours are all over the map.  No consistency."
good,My first experience as a temporary employee was during the Christmas Holidays of 12/ 2016- and was alright to some extent; but my second experience as a temporary employee was horrible due to poor management and miss-communications that lasted from 5/2018 to 07/2018.
good,"You have to make sure you know the store before you go in to work or else it's a pain to memorize and learn everything. Management is a mess sometimes, but can be good on some days. Breaks are amazing with a food court and starbucks. There are employee lockers and a lounge (both private for employees). Starting pay for such a big warehouse is super low compared to places like Mcdonalds where you stand around all day and do the same mechanized things daily. The staff is team based and you have to call customers ""guests"". If you have a bad team, it makes the job so much more miserable."
good,Target is mainly for teenage kids out of high school. Not enough wages to live off. Just good for a part time job. The consumables area was always backed up. Never able to catch up for the amount of hours given.
good,"In any customer service job, you have to deal with rude people but it doesnt help when you also have a toxic work environment. The upper managers (not including TLs) do not care about employees and they treated me like scum while I was pregnant. They require a doctors note to have water with you while working. At the service desk, I was also expected to handle broken glass from the backroom with no heavy duty gloves. One of the managers yelled at me for asking to leave work after I had just vomited. My fellow team members and front end team leaders were amazing and for the most part I had no problem with them, we all worked together as a team. But upper management was awful."
good,"My time in the Electronics department was somewhat enjoyable due to the young, like- minded coworkers I had. Management did not know what to do with the department though. I had a total of 3 different Department Managers in the short 7 months I worked there and none of them knew much about technology in general. The stock room, and register area was usually very messy due to some employees not caring enough to do their part. Other's had to constantly pick up the slack to try and make our area presentable. Bare bones weekly hours (5-10 normally)  made working there a joke unless you were pure full time."
good,"A typical work day was pulling merchandise from the back of the   shelves to the front and lining them neatly, pulling pallets from the stockroom and replenishing products, and re-shops for the area your assigned for the day."
good,"Slow or fast-paced days, no training, learned to multitask more than usual. Cashiering was more fun than my main job there. A few good managers and co-workers, but the experience wasn't a good one."
good,Used to be rated much higher but the new management has decided to hire outside rather than promote from within. Executive leadership constantly changing and bringing in new from outside. no experience or work ethic.
good,Constantly changing job roles and only offer hours to certain people. Have to push freight around customers and that makes shopping hard for the customers and the stocker job difficult to do efficiently
good,"My experience at Target was unpredictable because it was 80 percent based on the Customers attitude. One thing that annoyed me was some of the Managers really didn't listen to your wishes to stride into the company which made me left."
good,People are more focused on drama than actual work.  People get away with too much and new associates are screwed by senior management that know how to avoid work.
good,"I have been working in target for about a year now. However, this workplace does not meet my expectations. It's been a great experience where a learned a lot about logistics but my managers aren't giving me the opportunity to grow. It was first good job. Learn the routine was not hard at all. Everything there is really repetitive so for this job is great for those who do not have experience and want an easy to learn job."
good,"No benefits so if you work for Target I hope you have another job that has insurance/benefits "
good,"Some managers ruin it for everyone, some try to help make things better but are stifled by corporate. Things change often without communication. Hours are incosistent and unreliable, a high wage per hour does not help when everyone is getting as few hours as they are. However everyone I work with is very friendly and help make it worth it. My HR manager does everything she can to make work days fun. I’ve learned a lot through Target from my Guest Service experiences; dealing with quite a range of problems and questions has increased my overall people skills for sure."
good,"Target store 1109 definitely needed new management. They all had issues with every employee, more of a gossip center then a work environment. Everyday it was a new rumor like I was back in school."
good,"Advancement opportunities were good, but the level of work/life balance was poor.  Although it was good for retail in that they gave their managers every other weekend off."
good,fired all of the seasonal staff and did not keep any for after season. Failed to mention people were getting laid off until three days before their last day. highly irresponsible.
good,"This is a job for young people with little to no responsibilities. There is very little growth for advancement unless you kiss as** to the management. Pay is really low and also hours always fluctuate meaning one week you have 40 hours, the next 20 hours and the next 15 hours. I don't understand their business model."
good,"A typical work day involved me stocking the shelves, making our area presentable, and helping the guests with anything they need. Management was ok, the workplace culture was mostly friendly and it was easy to work there."
good,"Pros- I love the people I work with. We get paid well. I do get paid vacation time. It can be a fun environment to work in. You do get 30 minute lunch breaks if they schedule you 8 hours or more. There is a swap board to switch shifts with coworkers if you have a conflict."
good,"Not enough hours. Give them multiple years, get raises but then company changes hiring wage to the same wage you are making so every one in store within 5 years working and new hires get paid same. Treated like a number not a person."
good,"I was hired on as a seasonal employee and then hired on after season. I had two hours of self training and then thrown on a register. Then talked to when I made mistakes. They discourage talking amongst each other as they say there is too much do. So you’ll never have friends. Good luck get moved up unless your a favorite of a manager. And you MUST get 10 Red Cards a month. Even though they say there is no goal. You are under constant watch for every thing you do. It was fun, now it’s not."
good,"If managing to be spared the snap of the management and stay in the position that your got hired for its actually a decent place to work, very friendly team members and co-op team leads. However anyone in a position above team lead, like manager or store manager, tend to get ""drunk on power"" with no regard for team members, often demanding 20hr work loads to be done within an hour or less on a busy day. If you can get through that or have you team leader be on your side and understand its a fun place to work. Often have to do managers jobs along with your own job becasue they would rather sit around and talk to eachother all shift"
good,"very fast paced, have to be detailed oriented. need to have a positive and friendly attitude. have to be willing to cross train in multiple areas. friendly environment, unsteady hours as seasons change"
good,"Target is a good company to start a career it, however it is limited on advancement. You will struggle to have work/life balance and pay is average for retail."
good,"It was a fun workplace with good people. The often gave free snacks, and gift cards to good worker. However, there were no real benefits to working there. It felt like a dead-end job."
good,I generally enjoyed working at Target for the brief time I was there. The other employees were easy to get along with & I enjoyed cross training for different departments. I highly do not approve of their policy of not accepting doctor's notes for temporary restrictions.
good,"Target offers good benefits such as 401k, health insurance, dental insurance etc. The pay is decent if you're in management. The only things I didn't like were the poor management of my store and the fact that I had to work almost every single holiday.The company promotes a fast and friendly work environment. The hardest part of the job was working during the holiday season when we received massive amounts of freight and had to work extra long hours. Also had bossed that would make bad decisions but hold their leaders responsible for it."
good,"My experience at Target so far has been...different. The ""Training"" for 5 days is absolutely a lie. I was not trained whatsoever. I had training shifts and was assigned a person to train me, but they didn't. When you go to ask questions about something you don't know, you may get looked at like you have 10 heads because ""Shouldn't you have been trained on this?"" YES. I should have. But I was not trained on this. I was barely trained on ANYTHING. Just about everything I know I learned from asking the nicer people questions and watching other people do things. Thats basically how you learn at Target. Also, come January you get NO hours apparently. This seems to be not just a me problem, but for everyone. It is NOT my fault that Target overspent on wages during the holidays. I'm literally scheduled 5-10 hours per week, I'm not even joking, or exaggerating. This job can be ok, but I find myself calling to see if I can come in to work way too much, and too many weeks without more than 10 hours. Also, I was given attitude because I mentioned during my interview that I wanted to cut an hour off my night shifts when school starts because I'm a student. All I am asking is for my shifts to end at 8 instead of 9 on 2 days so that I get home at 8:30 not 9:30."
good,"Fast paced working experience, the managers are very downgrading to how they talk to you. They don't show you much to do and expect you to complete multiple task in a short shift. They give you 4 hours to complete 30 things."
good,"I think the people at Target are more stuck up then anywhere else. I do NOT agree w them not promoting from within. They will hire some young girl straight out of collage with no on hands work experience at all. Alls she knows is what a book has told her. things dont go as smoothly as in a book. I believe when she can show me how she, can do 5 hours of work in a 2 hour per period, then she can set that time limit. You cant just walk around with a clip board in your hands blurting out times and numbers without ever having seen whats all involved."
good,Extremely poor management. Lots of favortism was shown to team members who had worked at the dc the longest. Most of the managers are very unprofessional and have very poor communication skills. It is a very physically demanding and fast paced job. They do NOT value the workers and treat them as if they do not matter. The main focus is money.
good,"It was okay to work here, just like the title suggests. Some managers were cool but a couple were just awful. Acted like complete snobs and thought they were better than you because they were managers. HR ladies were wonderful."
good,"Inconsistent hours week to week."
good,"Target is as most retailers are - the beginnings of a career in the most basic sense. Retail jobs are easily performed, and at the lower end of the food chain it is a very flexible and attractive occupation to have while still in school."
good,There was more work than time allocated during a work week.  There wasn't a healthy work life balance and the inconsistencies within store leadership was problematic.
good,"Hours during the week were early, employees were nice if a life issue occurred you were punished for it especially if you were first hired. I took a Lyft ever morning to work."
good,My role at Target was never appreciated.  They only cared about the bottom dollar and didn't help advance peoples careers.  They did approve any time off I had unless it was during the holidays which was expected.
good,At any given time people were let go. Constant turnover and an extremely strict culture. Very physical labor and poor safety results. Never felt safe or secure in this job
good,Team leaders need more training and need to treat their employees fairly. Some team leaders make the work experience harder than it should be. Don’t get paid enough for the pressure that we get everyday.
good,"Its a good job for people who don't have a family life.Long hours, lots of overtime in the holiday months, High pay but also has crazy turnover rate there you are just a number that you need to stay up with."
good,Always working as a team but at the same time we fail individually for the simple idea of teams are not that great at times. The envirnment is busy but not extreme.
good,Target was a great place to work. In the last year Target has changed the way it runs its operations. I was told if our team could not evolve with change they should not be a part of our team and it was my job to get rid of them. Not something I agreed with for people who gave everything they had to Target.
good,Great Team to work with. Enjoyed the work but not management.  Feedback was not always encouraged or received in a professional manner.  The team members is what made the store.
good,"Target had a very friendly and welcoming environment,  was a good work place. They had free wifi and a cafe. They were fine with swapping shifts with other employees."
good,My typical day of work consisted of standing at a door and trying to prevent people from stealing.  I didn't learn much and management was constantly changing.  The hardest part was that it was so boring.  The most enjoyable part was meeting people.
good,"I was hired at Target as a Guest Service Team lead in a mass hiring for new stores opening in our area.  Training was extensive and thorough. The workplace culture was upbeat and often fun.  "
good,"I worked at Target as a Human Resources Team Member for 2.5 years. I loved the work: it was challenging and fun and usually self-directed. I hated the atmosphere: it was soul-sucking and ruthless and painful. I watched as dedicated and hard working employees were passed up time and again for promotions because they did not look the part of a manager. I watched them fold Team Leader positions (which did not require a degree) into Executive positions (which did require a degree). I was forced to give almost all of the allotted hours each week to the leadership team while the regular employees got whatever was left over. When I started at Target, I was one of 4 HR Team members, 2 full-time, 2 part-time. By the end of my 2.5 years, we had 1 full-time team member (me) and 1 part-time team member. When I approached my boss and the Store Team Leader to request weekends off and a raise, I was, I was politely ignored. I asked for $0.07 more per hour/ Not only did I not get the raise, but the Store Team Leader refused to aver discuss my request again."
good,Enjoyed this job.  got along with co-workers and management. It was a job i liked and it fit my lifestyle at the time.  But they closed the store and there  was not a opening for the hours i needed.
good,"Management expects workers to excel at their duties with little to no training. When I began working, they gave me little to no guidance as to what was expected, other than ""this is wrong, fix it."". "
good,Its just like any other job . the early mornings are very fast pace and productive but the team leaders does not know how to arrange the backroom properly.
good,C'mon this is retail people. And last time I was there management was absolutely atrocious. We had 3 different store leads in the 4 years I was there. And in those 4 years not once was I looked at for a promotion. Paid me okay. But the job is high stress for sure
good,Target is a great place to work but in employees are greatly under appreciated. Everyone is responsible to do so much and the expectations are to get everything asked done and more and in reality the team mainly gets to focus on pushing truck. Each store is different and it is the team members that make wanting to go work there matter.
good,I applied for a regular position but was only hired as a seasonal worker. And was let go once it was over with out any warning or notification what so ever.
good,"It was a wonderful job in the beginning and as soon as the management change everything went down hill from there. There was some prejudiced managers that will give someone who had the same background as them a high raise, which was not a problem until they give the lazy worker higher raise then the hard worker."
good,"During my time at target, it was good, until I moved up to Team Lead. The store manager played favorites and if you were not one of her favorites, the job became a lot more difficult."
good,Target had a horrible work-life balance. It made salaried managers work 70 plus hours a week so they could save money on the hourly employees. They also supported terminating long time employees before they could become eligible for retirement.
good,"I gave 100% in my position. My day was work intensive, but I found it made for a more productive day. The most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with my cohorts."
good,Its been awhile since I've worked here so I have nothing to review. All I remember is the wages and hours were not enough to make a living. I was also the bike builder which was a good experience.
good,"Target started off great.  I was able to promote to areas that were suited towards my strengths.  At the end, I was asked to close too much to help my team run as efficiently as they were able to in the past.  The expectations had increased due to the lack of leaders in the building.  When leaders quit, there were no replacements."
good,"lack of communication from corporate to management down to sales floor"
good,"Fast paced, easy job that does not require too much of you. The only thing most people may find uneasy is that they do push you to upsell quite a bit and not everyone is comfortable / great at sales."
good,"Working with the Target in Mankato, MN. You have to work hard to get the hours you want. However, even working hard doesn't ensure you will get more hours. With it being in a ""College Town"" majority of the jobs are Part-Time. I have tried to get Full-time hours but I haven't gotten them"
good,"I was with the company for 13 years and was fired for ""taking work home"" without permission.  The previous store manager allowed this to occur since much of the work was confidential and employees were constantly called to back up cashier.  A new district manager and store manager came into the picture and terminated my employment.  I had no negative information in my file and every annual review was outstanding.  I feel the company was completely unfair.  What was once a family oriented store soon turned to the might dollar and employee care did not matter.  You had to have open availability at all times.  I often went into work at 12pm on Christmas night because it was actually December 26th."
good,This is not the worst place to work. You either out grow the place or you grow within the company. There's really no in between. If you have kids they are very understanding.
good,"A typical day would be cashiering, customer service, folding clothes or stalking shelves.  I learned a different cashier system.  I learned how to bag items.  Management was decent, lots of gossip within the employees, the hardest part was the culture difference between me and the majority of the staff where we clashed with the difference in language."
good,"The Target i work at it was fun to work at my supervisor was awesome if i could work for Target again i would my manager was fair , The managers love talking about the FFF at the meetings at job"
good,"A typical day for my position at Target is entirely based on what is needed that day. There are high expectations of what needs to be completed daily but often very little time to actually fulfill it. This issue is exacerbated by the almost-frequent call-outs and other issues. Most of the management team are relatively easy to talk to and get needs addressed, but transference of frustration is a problem within their ranks.The job itself does not require much on a basic level, but it teaches those who really commit to finishing things a high degree of flexibility, time management, and assessment of what is possible and what is not in order to maximize effectiveness. The culture tends to be supportive when looking at those who do commit themselves to the job, but that denigrates when looking toward the average worker.The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress of knowing how much still needs to be completed and accepting that some things might not get done. While praise is sparing, receiving it can be the most enjoyable part of the job after finishing a hard task."
good,I was working with Target for a little over a year and I loved it! But I was terminated due to an incident that happened at the beginning of my career with Target. I am no longer able to work at another Target due to new management. The new store manager wanted a new team and terminated a good amount of us.
good,"The pressure to sell Red Cards (credit cards) was way to much and hurt my values as a person. I loved Target as a customer and when I became an excited team member the love was lost in meeting quotas.They would threaten to terminate my job a lot because of not meeting their 2+ red cards a day; there were a lot of times when I went above and beyond myself while sacrificing my integrity for Target, but the payoff was not worth much. My pay increased a dime, and I decided it was not worth it. Incessantly asking every single customer if they wanted a credit card, being praised one day and being threatened to get terminated the next. I signed up to be a cashier but sold credit cards like a salesperson, I didn't get commission like a salesperson would, but I definitely made target money by doing so. Bottom line, I was a good employee and never missed work but this was not worth it in my opinion."
good,"I initially took this position due to family circumstances. It served its purpose for my family, however, I found it difficult to achieve any kind of advancement within the company despite always receiving positive feedback from management about my performance and interactions with the guests. The culture there is quite reminiscent of college, perhaps even High School, in the social aspect."
good,Great place to start out but there is no way to move up unless you have connections.  You do learn a lot of people skills and basic retail knowledge but the amount you get paid for the work you do is not always right.
good,Most Enjoyable Part Was Unloading The Trucks. We Would Usually Go Through 2 Trucks A Night But During 4th Quarter It Was 3-4 Trucks A Night. Very Fast Paced.
good,"The company as a whole is decent to work for. The work is fast paced. The hours are bad three quarters of the year and 40 during holidays. No over time. Threats of getting wrote up and/or fired for not going to lunch in 5 hours of work or going over time. You get stuck working poor hours for months/years on end with no consideration for my quality of life. Though they promote that in their handbook. There are some Management issues that desperately need to be handled. Direct manager was piety, abusive and passive aggressive. Had to go to HR to complain and asked to be moved. Was never moved. Management needs courses in employee relations and ethics. However you get to meet a lot of wonderful people who are employees and customers (guest). Would offer opportunities to advance and never execute. Advance others on the basis of favoritism."
good,Target has an incredibly cut-throat work environment. team members have little to no chance of moving up unless they're in with a Social Circle of the managers. there is a double standard between how people are treated and what is expected of them. Managers often disappear for days at a time without any direction.
good,When I first started the culture was fun and friendly but after 2 years there was a drastic shift in the culture.  Employees were constantly expected to do more with less.  I personally was passed over for promotion several times even though I was the best fit for the position.  Management changed so often that you constantly had to prove yourself to the new ETLs and TLs.  The healthcare options were a joke.  You could chose a low cost plan in which you would pay more out of pocket or another plan.  Neither were really beneficial to an employee trying to support themselves.
good,Target is a great learning environment and is willing to give you the appropriate training before expecting perfection. They will coach you accordingly and note your strengths and weaknesses as well as give you additional coaching when need be.
good,This is a retail corporation. The bottom line is cost efficiency. At times it was a great place to work  and at times it was extremely stressful. There needs to be more training implemented for new hires and more crucial equipment available to the team members to effectively complete job duties.
good,"Target has the potential to be a really nice place to work at, but there was much disagreement between most employees and the store manager when I worked there. There were scheduling issues, along with what other staff members might consider ""Unfair"" interactions with certain Management."
good,"The management is great but the working hours are horrendous. I've been there since October 2017 and never worked more than 20 hrs/wk. It's a great place to work, but the hours are very scarce."
good,"I enjoy working with the public and meeting new people daily. Sure there are some tough customers to deal with, but I keep a smile on my face and give the best customer service I can."
good,"My first year there was nice and easy,  everyone I worked with was cool we was a family a team.  Then they fired a lot of good workers for new young workers messed everything up"
good,Didn't learn anything. just a normal job. day in day out same delusional managers that have no idea whatg they are doign that they themselves couldnt care less about what goes on.
good,"I enjoy working at target because of the people I work with. There is no communication or appreciation for anything. The only way for advancement is to be well liked by an elite group. I have come up with several ideas which management has passed it off as their own in order to advance. I go above and beyond and get criticized for everything. I have had been disrespected by managers and tried to resolve issues with both the direct person and the higher up management and nothing got resolved and it made it me not want to come to work. I am the type of worker that comes to work with a positive attitude and ready to work hard. It's hard to want to continue to work there when you leave feeling underappreciated."
good,"Cashier or floor stock (hardlining). Customer care, assist customers should they need anything; for example, wanting to know where things are etc. Management was fair, but hardly ever saw general manager. The atmosphere was casual and easy-going for the most part, although there were days, especially during the holiday season where things were stressful and overwhelming."
good,"It hard for me to enjoy working in such a slow passed environment I need to have constant movement, or something to do other than standing in one location for hours on end."
good,I was hired during the Christmas holiday's for extra help and was let go after New years. I enjoyed working there for the holidays to make some extra cash.
good,"Target pays upper management well and rewards longevity with money but usually rinses through everyday employees. You learn some, get paid well for a bit and then move on...Unless you want to move to Minneapolis and pretend you know what working on the salesfloor looks like."
good,A typical day at work begins with unloading a delivery truck. It is fast-paced from the moment we clock in. I learned while working at Target that management doesn't always have their team members' best interests at heart and a lot of hard work goes unnoticed; rather they recognize and show appreciation to those who can help them meet their quota and help them look good to their superiors. The team is fun and the culture is loud and energetic most of the time. The hardest part of the job is the manual labor and the lack of appreciation for hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help guests find what they are looking for and leave the store happy.
good,"It's a nice place to work, mostly. Except if you don't already know someone that works there nobody talks to you and ignores you. Other than that it was alright, I guess."
good,"As a service ambassador I was hired on during a remodel, the store was constantly changing so the only way to know where items were was to use a device. Target haired so many people during the time that they often ran out of devices so it became hard and time consuming to help guests. There were many different things being said by different leaders which made it difficult to know what you were supposed to be doing."
good,Some of the managers were very rude and treated me like I was slow or something. I had 2 days of training during holiday season and was thrown on my own after day 3. They complained that I wasn't fast enough and always asked if I knew how to zone properly. Some of my coworkers were also rude and got into verbal arguments with customers that I had to resolve and apologize for on Target's behalf.
good,The pay is decent compared to other places but hours are very limited. People have to cover shifts just to meet 40 hours. Most of the ETLs are very professional and pleasant. There are a few that could use some retraining on work place ethics.
good,lacks freedom and too stressful and strict there management sucks they don't alloy time off even when you have it its not paid and there policies are outrageiuos. the place is very large and they lack tack.
good,"Management never is on the same page, they were always short on time and help, nobody seems to be able to communicate with the floating management."
good,"Target as a company is pretty standard for retail. High stress work at odd hours for minimum pay and no benefits.  It does work well with work life balance, but often coming at the sacrifice of hours.  It's a good part time job if you are starting out or need to get through college, but with little room for advancement don't plan on making a career there."
good,I am not sure what went wrong but I worked at a Target store for three years in another state before I relocated and the new Target store is horrid. The management is unorganized and young and acts accordingly. Target at a company is glorious and the CEO is one of the nicest people but this store needs to be whipped into shape.
good,"I enjoyed the customer very much. However, it was very unbalanced, however, I did my part and my job that was required of me. But was misinformed about the information."
good,You normally a hired as a part time associate and can pick up hours/shifts to make 40 hours. It is hard to find management that is willing to work with you for family emergencies. Customers can be difficult and you must have an extreme amount of patience to deal with them and management.
good,"Job is good experience for first time workers, learn customer service and how to work with others. Learn how to keep things clean and work quickly. Management usually isn’t too harsh"
good,"I had good and bad experiences working with target."
good,"Was a great place to work until recently, management could not communicate well with each other. When management communicated with employee's always a different thing on how we were to do one thing in the store. different sayings from different management. I was judged poorly because my boss was never there to observe and only assumed on my work ethics based on her feelings towards me."
good,"Target was a clean environment, safe, and friendly place to work in.  When working holidays they catered food in.  The only thing I would have preferred is more hours to  fit my schedule better."
good,"The work environment made it overly stressful after the warehouse closing down. The warehouse made it easier to store extra product that could not fit in our Towson Store. Re-modifying the back room and receiving (this is where we get our trucks and vendor) made it slightly better but the amount of product we receive makes it impossible get it 100% clean."
good,There is poor management in some areas in the company with lack of trust and lack of leadership. There are clear favorites and lack of help and teaching.
good,"As a Guest Service Attendant, working at Target can be a little stressful. We get paid the same as cashiers ($12/hr) even though we do twice as much work as they do. Although we’re allotted more hours and very little benefits, it isn’t fair pay for the amount of work that we do. The upper management team doesn’t seem to be interested in development."
good,"too much pressure from management to get guest to sign up for their RedCards. They make it a requirement to keep your job, get hours, or even be able to advance within the company. love getting the discounts and love the starbucks within the store. creating new friendships is enjoyable."
good,Wasn’t too bad. Stressful and felt unappreciated while working there. Management seemed to not give enough time to learn how to do the job before expecting you to know what to do
good,"Offers a fast paced work environment with great people along side you. Hours can be crazy, so don't expect a lot of free time or a set schedule. Don't expect special treatment from anyone no matter how hard you work. Pay is fairly low for the amount of work you are asked to do."
good,I would never ask anyone to work here. They don't know the first thing about business is take care of your workers and make them feel at ease. They don't value your schedule and schedule you for all hours... Even though you told them the hours you could work. Management was very poor.
good,"I was only there for a little over a month because I was not getting the hours I think I deserved and the lack of management. "
good,Management wasnt terrible if you didn't deal with them often.  What made the job bearable was knowing that all your co-workers were in the boat with you.
good,It all depends on the store you work for. My store was a pilot store and we had a lot of new and different requirements we had to meet and sometimes the higher power didnt understand the store needs.
good,loved how customers don't have to wait more than 60 seconds to get help. I learned how to do many things such as using their devices. there is really nothing hard so any one can actually do any department in the store.
good,It’s not a bad job there is just no growth internally. They rarely promote from within and prefer to hire outside. The management is more concerned with making their bonus instead of staffing properly.
good,Target is being effected by Amazon just like everything else the hours are close to none after working there for over 20 years I find myself having to beg for more hours when I have open availability
good,"My team lead is excellent.  Most ETLs are not helpful at all.  They spend a lot of tine walkung around or sitting in office. "
good,"I have worked at two Target supercenters. Job security is stable. Upward mobility is near impossible and extremely biased. Most targets treat their employees as expendable peons. There is no respect. But, they rarely fire people as they need bodies on the floor."
good,The workplace was fine as it was quiet and not a lot of people were back there all at one time. My coworkers were easy to work with and were always helpful if I needed any.
good,"Target offered barely above minimum wage, and guarantees their employees more hours during employment than they're actually given. The higher managers are rude and entitled"
good,"This job didn’t offer me much growth or anything for that matter. I was hardly ever scheduled until holiday seasons and then I’d be over worked, especially for the pay."
good,"There's no denying that target has an amazing minimum wage of eleven dollars an hour. It also has a pretty fair break schedule. However, the work environment is souless."
good,"My experience working for Target was pretty average. It would've been okay, except management took a severe turn for the worse. The work itself is mostly busy work--cleaning the store, zoning, and helping guests whenever possible."
good,I began working during the 2017 seasonal position and it was stressful for the month of December. I was scheduled to leave at 11pm and was forced to work until 2am without notice or ability to leave.
good,A very fast pace environment that can be relaxing at some moments but also have very fast pace days. they offer fulltime only to those who follow the rules.
good,"Its okay place to work.work hours are good hourly pay is good,co workers are team player. Sometimes they offer free good for workers for safety goals."
good,"Production standards are strictly monitored hourly by management. Management will time you on certain functions and continually question staff if averages fall below company standards.  Separation among production team members and management, no cohesive work environment. If you can handle manual labor for 12 hours/3 days a week...the rest of the week is yours. Decent salary with overtime available."
good,"over all worked with good people, set work hours. No overtime allowed. The team leaders had a lot on their plate and received no help from upper management"
good,"The job is not hard, the people are nice to work with however the management team sometimes do not pull their weight and work short days and leave early especially on weekends."
good,Takes advantage of part timers with loop holes to use them as much as full timers but no benefits and no clear way to get promoted or advance in the company
good,"As a Recovery specialist, my job consisted of interacting with a diverse group of people, internally or externally. It helped build strong communication and organizational skills. I learned how to creatively resolve problems and troubleshoot solutions. Management is somewhat supportive of development and I was giving a opportunity to provide the idea behind a product line that is currently offered at Target Stores. It is sometimes difficult dealing with disgruntled individuals, but being creatively, persuasive helped me manage those situations with ease. I worked to keep my creative spirit alive in a strict corporate environment, now I'm looking to move into an industry where a person like myself can thrive and grow. I really enjoyed the people I worked wit the most, as Target offers a diverse and inclusive work environment."
good,Poor leadership. Too many entitled brats in management. Have no idea how some of these people got hired. Management treats team members like lesser people.
good,"Good flexible hours if you get some. Played favoritism a lot had to suck up to all the lazy managers. Customers were the worst most stuck up people, think they deserve everything."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job and flexiable to help co workers and keep inform update everytime which really good each other and more understand better
good,"Being a cashier at Target is very fast paced. You operate the cash register, ring up guests, sometimes handle returns, etc. If needed, they also have you help in other areas of the store. The pay is decent (it doesn’t support the cost of living) and they are serious about cashiers getting “Red Cards”."
good,Target is a great place to find low priced and well made merchandise. It is a fantastic place to shop. Working at target you will always be on the move and never seem to have nothing to do. Target is a great place to learn how to give great customer service as well as make sales. The managers have really high expectations and procedures however it seems that they never have to follow them. If you mess up even one task they seem to be very disappointed and tend to let you know. A lot of the managers have unreachable goals and expectations for the employees.
good,Target is a good place for a teen or college student to work. The pay is not so good and they require you to take on a lot for little pay. The job is not very hard it's just that there isn't enough workings and the shifts are almost never steady.
good,"I have been working at Target since 2014. This was my first job and during the 3 years that I have been with the company I have managed to familiarize myself with all of the departments. The environment is very stressful as it is retail but other than that the management isn't great. I've had to train my managers and other employees without receiving a raise. Whenever I go into work I work in up to 3 different departments, whether it be cashiering, guest services, order pickup, or the sales floor. I don't feel appreciated and that my skills are being valued or being put to good use."
good,"It was a very stressful,and not worth it work environment. They expected you to work above your pay grade but show you no respect. They would pass you over for a promotion in favor of someone who they were friends with."
good,"Working was a  new learning experience each day, Driven professional with the propensity for achieving goals. Proven ability to provide cross - functional team leadership, driving performance, quality initiatives and the ability to develop key ideas in wealth management strategies."
good,"Target could have treated their employees better and not pick and choose their most liked employee. It is understandable that employees are to promote red cards to guest, but it isn't fair that it is the conversation rate that is used to calculate if an employee is getting a raise or not. Especially for employees that are part-timers only."
good,Target is a good place to work. Hours are somewhat limited in the first half of the year and it can be hard to make ends meet.. Overall not a bad place to work if seeking a part-time position...
good,my favorite aspects of working at target are meeting people.  I enjoy seeing different people everyday. It is always so much fun to see and talk with the kids that come shopping with their moms and dads.
good,"For what you do, they do not pay their employees enough. Managers always take credit of what you do, and you'll feel less appreciated about all the hardwork you do."
good,"Target was a great retail job, with flexible hours. With many places in the store to work. The team members are upbeat and helpful. The hardest part of the job is learning where everything is in the store in order to better help the quests. The management was always coming up with better ways to help the company run smoother, all the while making the store a better environment for the quests."
good,You will often be in charge of your own work with management keeping an eye on you. You will often find yourself getting new instructions from management. Tough place to work for in longer periods. I don't think I could honestly recommend working at Target.
good,"The health, benefits and discounts are great. Most of the managers do not know how to talk to their employees. The managers want respect but do not give respect to their employees. Breaks are very short for being there for 10-12 hours out of the day. A 30 min break and a 25 min break if you are working for 12 hours but during the breaks, you do not have to clock out. You get paid weekly on thursdays. Quick money but the ware and tear on your body is not worth the money."
good,Gave me the ability to interact with different vendors and the opportunity to develop your customer service skills while honing your management skills. You are allowed to work on your own in a store if you are a PMT. You can see people advance on the sales side but not a lot of trust or reliability in the technician side most see pmt's as a simple minded people with no opportunity to advance despite any vocational certifications or years of experience. you are not paid for what you know but when you arrive to the company. A degree is a must to advance but doesn't matter in which field.
good,"General retail stuff, was not at all that compelling or interesting but the interaction is a daily basis for customers and doesn't need much to really be considered a job."
good,"Target used to be a Great Company Then they decided to upgrade all their stores to tune of 7 billion dollars  and  this created many problems in the workforce, many quit, As Hours were cut back.No money etc. "
good,"The work is easy and quick to do and most of my coworkers are generally nice. If there were any problems i would say its:"
good,"Between jobs in 2013, I lucked out and worked at a Target with a great STL (Store Team Lead) and other team leaders and team members. Loved it there."
good,My job was awesome during the busy season. Once the holidays ended i no longer received adequate work hours. They do not schedule enough people to complete the required daily tasks.
good,"Workplace is just ok.  Employees are never given enough hours to help make ends meet.  Most are usually given less than 20 hrs a week to work.  They should have more steady hours for employees.  And while it is wonderful for them to now give us $11 an hour, most places are already giving their employees $15!  The human resources at the Langhorne location really need to be evaluated.  They are not team players and do not pay attention to the needs of the employees, their requests for time-off, etc."
good,"fast paced and competitive. A very diverse culture, and many friendly people. Large Aisles giving lots of room to move around. Paid their hourly managers very well. However, they were willing to break food safety rules by having sick employees work with food."
good,"A typical day includes stocking and back stocking in a timely manner, receiving goods through mail or vendor, updating inventory as often as possible, pulling product for customers, and engaging with customers."
good,In the right location under the right management team Target can be a fantastic place to work.  I enjoyed that the company was actively involved with their community.
good,"It has been over 5 years since I worked there, but can imagine little has changed. "
good,If your looking for a job with very little hours then this would be the job for you. I was supposed to be full time working at least 35 to 40 hours a week. I am trained in all sections of the store and they refuse to work me. They keep promising me more hours but it never happens no matter how many times I talk to them. They just kept making empty promises.
good,"Great selection, good customer service, great prices, wide selection of products. Human resources very friendly and helpful. And in store eatery a plus"
good,The store had too many chiefs with too little Indians. It would have been better if people worked together more. The discount is not as good as you would think
good,"Target is a good job for someone attending school or needs work part-time, unless they plan to be a store manager.  While the job requires some physical exertion, it is not difficult   There are many managers around to help with any issue an Associate may have.  They base their business on customer service,"
good,When I first started working at Target I was very happy and loved my job. As time went on they changed bosses and things changed. We were often expected to clean up after our bosses who decided to leave work early. Our pay stayed the same and our responsibilities and stress increased. I had to leave because I felt I was being taken advantage of. On top of everything they kept on scheduling me outside of my availability and were not very receptive to admitting their mistakes.
good,"Can never get full-time hours, Worked there for over 5 years. I make as much as someone walking in off the street because they raised the minimum pay for all."
good,"Huge issue of favoritism, unequal pay. Job itself is pretty easy but the people make it much more difficult. Management did not want to work with employees to solve anything."
good,retrieve carts from inside and outside of the store and bring them to them to the front to be used by arriving guests. clean restrooms and spills across the store. remove trash from outside and throw them into the compactor.
good,"Managers tend to be relaxed with their work, and put it onto the team members who end up doing all the work, and never get recognition when there is a visit from the district manager. Managers give unrealistic timeframes for work to be done. Morale can be low during these times, but its not the worst place to work. Its retail after all."
good,"I.T has potential to be a great place to work I.T. Really depends on management, retail is never easy because customers like you to pull deals out of nowhere"
good,If you get a temp job here you can kiss your butt good bye when its over and they treat your poorly the money is ok and workload keeps you busy but overall its not worth it unless its a full job
good,"Target is a great employer to work for. Their culture is a good one, and I can truly say that it was the best retail job I've ever had. I chose to left my specific location due to management, but overall I'd recommend Target to people looking for a job."
good,People were not very friendly in break room. As a cashier I just checked groceries and other goods all day. Managers would get angry if we didn't have enough people come through our line sign up for Target Red cards (debit and credit cards with horrible interest rates).
good,When I was working here I was breastfeeding my son at the time. They would never let me go pump when needed and if he got sick the would take me off the bored for the following week
good,Work environment is very friendly. Shifts are different all the time. Management is okay for the most part. Learned great customer skills while I worked there.
good,Mangers are horrible and they never promote within the company . Favarotism is highley and they rarley hive hours even if youve been there for years .
good,"Great place to learn customer service"
good,Target is good place to work don’t get me wrong but if you have bad mamgent then it doesn’t go over very well. But co workers make up for it but the environment overall is good.
good,most of the time its a fast paced work place which most don't understand. your their to work not make friends or keep others from doing their work. also many people believe that your the mean one yet they can be mean to you and everyone else including management. Above all with the right people it can be a productive and fun day at any target as long as the same goal is involved to finish the job and go home and take care of business.
good,Target itself is a great company to work for . Do they choose the best employees ? (I don’t think so ) . If you get lucky with a manager then you will be able to get a promotion. Other than that you will stay as a cashier or an associate.
good,"The management was horrible, they never noticed when a task was done perfectly and they didn't care on whether you were sick or not. The workplace was good, you will meet a lot of new people."
good,very good place to work. low salary but overall a great place to bring in some type of income. very nice coworkers and properly handled management for staffing
good,"very nice place to work, but lack of pay.i swear if they paid more i wouldve retired from that place but due topay  i had to leave. only 10 percent discount"
good,"Very flexible work schedule, but the supervisor's and lower management team are fresh college graduates that have not been trained properly! Also at times management will over exert their authority!"
good,The corporation does not pay the employees enough for the work they do. The pay is barely enough for a single person to live on. People with children will need help from welfare to survive on these wages.
good,"I was very excited about working at target. It was a great experience for the first few months. Then the management started to take a turn for the worse and I was dreading to come back more and more each day. Over all, I love my co workers! They’re an amazing group of people and the whole target team works so hard to make the wheels turn every day! But the management has corrupted the target name."
good,"The people that I worked with were very friendly, I just am not scheduled very often. I would love to continue working here, I just wish that they scheduled me more often, I am trying to save money for college and I can't do that when I only work 12 hours every two weeks."
good,"At the time I was employed at this establishment the management, scheduling, and HR were terrible. Employees were not treated well and employees were fired for very minor reasons."
good,"Target was a good company to work for i had started working there because i have moved to a new state, i was looking for something more stable. i enjoyed working there, it just wasn't the job for me"
good,Management needs to be improved! Hard working and reliable workers get laid off with minimal notice!! I was laid off with very little notice and the pay was not worth the work required!
good,I belive the managers expect to much of there workers and don't help out when were behind they rather just yell at us.  Were a job that requires us to talk to our customers they drill into our head service but then never follow service
good,I would never work at target again. The hours were erratic and some weeks we had as little as 12 hours. Some even got 8 hours. There was no overtime. The management is very childish. I felt like I was in high school again. Everyone plays favorites. So if you were a favorite you got 30+ hours. If you were despised then management would find little things to write you up for so they would accumulate and they would have cause to fire you. It's very high demanding.
good,"No one in management reliably stood up to corporate deadlines, so we were stretched thinner and thinner every 6 months.  At first it was manageable, even somewhat fun to work there.  Over time, we learned to make do as best we could with tighter deadlines and constraints.  By the end it was completely impossible.  Getting extra time was like pulling teeth and ultimately led to another crew helping (instead of allowing the actual crew time to complete the task).  This method completely splintered worker relations, who didn't believe it was their job and cared little about the result (understandably).  Trying to suggest changes resulted in naught.  Methods of saving time here or their were always nixed in favor of ones that inefficiently wasted time.  The stress became completely unmanageable, and I just had to get out of there.  It got so bad that by the end I was doing the work for 3-4 people with the time allotment for 1 and a half.  They systematically edged people out of receiving benefits come open enrollment, and raises were a joke.  Sure they subscribed to the increased $1/hr each year (with maybe a dime for your actual raise), but the hours provided to the store were cut each time to save the cost.  It didn't help that management got bonuses each year for saving x amount of hours, and they always operated at that level.  We went through a lot of store managers while I worked there, some fired disgracefully, others using it as a stepping stone.  Constant in-fighting among the lower-level managers because jurisdiction was split between hierarchy, present team lead(s), and"
good,quick pace  was not worker friendly. management was hard to work for. Very stressful never easy to work there not sure if it has changed or not haven't worked there in a long time
good,"Target is extremely cutthroat. While they do serve the community well, if an employee is not a ""fit"" for the company they take every opportunity to let the person know it."
good,"It was usually slow as a cahsier. They tried to be flexible with hours but itd always submit that I can only work a certain amount of hours due to school, but it went ignored. Got somewhat angry for calling off sick."
good,Pay and compensation is decent. Poor management may come in and the better management tend to move on. Very difficult to move up with or without a degree.
good,"I worked in the food avenue. It is usually slow paced. Unfortunately that is offset by working completely alone the majority of the time. Management also seems to not care at all about the food avenue, so when we need deliveries, orders or anything in general, it is the last of their priorities. "
good,"Actual slave work - store so busy lines would be so long and they would never schedule enough people "
good,"Target can be a good or stressful work experience depending on management. Part time hours are what you will be stuck with for the most part unless you can move higher up, which can be hard cause it's all about favorites as far as team lead candidates go. They also have a bad habit of scheduling people to work in departments that are not their primary place which can be irritating if you are not as skilled there compared to your normal work center. Some days are good others days not as much, it's typical entry level retail work."
good,"Target was my first place of steady employment. From my experiences, I worked hard and did my job well, if not better than most others, and was not often recognized for it. I performed nearly ever job function at the retail store possible at some point mostly because I simply asked to, so that was a benefit. The work itself, the customers, the co-workers were all fine and often times enjoyable, but management was by and far the worst part and significantly hindered deriving joy from my work. I understand they are under pressure from the store lead and corporate, on top of having to deal with less-than-ideal workers, but I was constantly being pushed and pulled from my assigned responsibilities of the day to do someone else's unfinished or lacking work, only to lose progress on my job and be judged for it later. There were many times I simply got my jobs done so quick that management thought I didn't do anything because they didn't see me do it. Overall, it was a part-time school job so couldn't expect much."
good,"Target is a decent job for part time, temporary work while going to school or as a second job. Very little opportunity for growth with any substantial pay."
good,"Management was ok but to busy with themselves to care for their employees. My Teamlead was afraid I would take her job because I was happy and learned quickly and everyone liked me so she had me move to cafe, where I was miserable. I hold two degrees, there's no reason I should have been stuck in cafe."
good,"If you’re like me, a teenager who just finished high school, and are looking for a comfortable job to have while starting college, this might not be the job for you. They want you completely invested in what happens in the store. If not"
good,"cashing guests out "
good,Target was a good place to learn about retail and customer service. It was however very stressful at times and I was expected to do too much. A typical day I would have to help unload the truck for an hour and then have nine to ten hours of work to do in seven hours. The management was alright but pushed way too much. At times it was fun though with fellow team members.
good,"The basic job of running a retail store is conceptually not very difficult.  It consists of 3 basic functions:  keep stock on the shelf, trash off the floor and taking care of the customers.  "
good,"It wasn't very difficult to work at Target. As long as you did what you were suppose to do, you got a lot accomplished. The negative side is those who had worked there longer than you were allowed to slack more, therefore at the end of your long work day you had to stay longer for their negligence."
good,"I was hired on a seasonal cashier. I didn't intend to stay after the holiday season even if they asked me too. It can be a good company to work for overall, I just didn't care for the position I was in. Being a cashier and standing at one register all day every day is definitely not something I would be able to do forever. It doesn't give you time to talk to guest or engage in conversation which made the job boring. The management was always good and very understanding of every situation."
good,"The company says they like longevity with their team members, but make it hard to advance.  No work/life balance.  Good benefits and encourage those in school with a great schedule."
good,"management seems carefree, while the low level team supervisors and employees are always stressed out. The management only take their jobs seriously when they know its for something important. "
good,Schedules are only known 9 days to two weeks in advance. Always different. Works in food market and hardlines. Pushing freight. Setting endcaps. Assisting guests with purchase decisions. Fast and hard working environment. Very low pay and no benefits. Team members willing to help other team members.
good,Most of the hiring from Target comes around the holidays during the shopping rush. So they hire a bunch of local folk who spend up to 12 hours inside a sometimes negative degree weather trailer grabbing cardboard boxes that are frozen to the floor. The breaks are incredibly short for a 12 hour day. 2 15m breaks and a 30m lunch.
good,"coworkers are great, managers are cool, but they expect too much. pushy and schedule you more than you ask for. seem to forget you have a life too...."
good,If you like impotent management and getting jerked around this is the place for you. Top down changes come from someone in corporate who has probably never set foot in a store and has no idea what a real team member actually experiences.
good,Management needs to step up a little and show that they care about their job. They don't really get to know the employee's that work for them. Rarely see them as well. They should be more sociable.
good,Worked in different roles in the warehouse. From unloading trucks to loading trucks. Fast paced and over worked. Could not have an opinion that differed from the management.
good,"Target isn't a bad place to work. It offers competitive pay for a starting position, and not too much is asked of you. Although, if you're looking for a place to sink your time in effort in to, this probably isn't it. Getting promoted is like an act of congress, and it doesn't happen quickly. In my experience, that's just the nature of these types of jobs. Coming from a background in retail such as Walmart and Best Buy."
good,"The management is poor, there are a lots of thing to be improved, the pay is good, for a entry position, little life/work balance."
good,"Never can advance unless you are related to the ETLs. Yearly raise was equal to .09 to .49 increase in pay. Ideas are frowned upon. If you were too good at your job, you never received a promotion. they wanted you to stay where you were because it made it easier for them."
good,"Typical retail job, you hours are never the same. Even as a supervisor. This was another job where you can only move around if you know the right people. You are easily replaceable. The annual raises are pitiful."
good,"The overall idealism behind Target is great, but the management that is staffed is not on board. They have formed alliances and literally pull team members in, fail them, then push them out; when they really need to take a step back on analysis the roots of the problem."
good,"Never knowing your days off till s week before. Can never male plans . never having two days off in a row."
good,High turnover in key leadership positions lead to horrible culture. Group think is rampant. Bias is overwhelming. Training is subpar. No true mentorships.
good,Unloading the daily truck. Back stock goods from the truck and help stock the floor with products. What I like most is seeing the new stuff that is coming in.
good,I didn't like my job at Target and was happy to leave. Target has a policy of making everyone a Target person. This is very tiresome with lots of general meetings about motivation etc. Yet management did not follow through with support for the employees.
good,They give you bad hours there is no advancement within the company . There is no opportunity for potential Growth. The management is good . You cannot change your availability even if you are past your 90 days they are not flexible to fit your schedule / needs .
good,Management was not great. people were given promotions based off of favoritism. most employees are nice and considerate. felt as if management did not appreciate its employees
good,"I worked unloading the trucks around 2am till 9sih am. I liked the physical labor of the job and the time just cruised by. What I did liked was how they handled letting seasonal workers go. Which, for me, was 'We, have to let you go in two weeks, by the way your aren't on the schedule for the next two weeks'."
good,Everyone there was really easy to work with besides some of the managers. There was never sufficient training and some of the people with higher job titles felt as if they did not have to work as hard as everyone else.
good,"Core merchandising is fast paced, stressful and full of rework.  Leadership cannot align quickly or consistently and the teams beneath them are at their mercy."
good,"I was a hardlines member during the holiday season from the beginning of October through Jan. Under scheduled cashiers led to us leaving at late hours. We had a large turn over rate due to this, and it was always brushed off as our fault when we had too many carts of product to get out. "
good,I would not offer a friend to work there. They had to Many managers who did not  explain or know what they are doing.Hardest part was changing of managers on a regular basis.
good,"a very good workplace culture to work i learn management people"
good,"I find the store I work in is an unorganized mess. Orders are not done properly, management schedules their employees with little to no personal time."
good,Good place to work right our of college. Management did not make it easy to continue my education by scheduling me for late night shifts that were also outside of my specified availability.
good,"Good starter job, good days off, fast paced work, managers are very easy to get along with, good job for after school or early morning, or a side job to make a little extra"
good,"basic entry level job had it in college and they did work with my school schedule, they were nice but nothing I would consider as a great opportunity and decent benefits"
good,managers sucks. the only good thing is the pay. weird hours. favoritism. good work culture. need patience. hardest part is the hrs you get and the good thing is they give you free food almost everyday
good,"It's a fast paced environment, but it feels like things just spin in circles.  Progress is slow...turning a giant ship take a long time, but leaders want everything now."
good,"Just okay. Upper management is weak. A lot of salary turn-over, due to dis-engagement with senior management. Senior Management needs to get out on the floor and engage more, other than to just take their once a day parade lap."
good,"Target gave me work experience. While management at Target was not great, working for Target was not so bad. Working at Target definitely Made me challenge myself to work outside my comfort zone and push myself."
good,Target is a decent retail store as compared to the others but it is very high paced and high demand since it is such a big corporation with a lot of traffic.
good,"If it wasn't for the upper management, I probably never would have left. I really enjoyed the team members and the regular guests that came in. Though there were difficult times, there were also I a lot of good times."
good,Its a good job to have temporary. You get to deal with lots of different people and helps you control yourself in different situations.if you dont like being told what to do this probably wouldn't be a good job for you.
good,I wasn't a fan of the environment in target. I felt that i was trapped in my one job and could expand further. Management also would never allow time off if you asked for it.
good,"The coworkers were the best thing about this job. Having great coworkers made the night go quicker. They have unrealistic expectations as far as numbers go. And they are pretty unforgiving. The job itself was easy, but keeping up a fast pace just to ""make prod"" was exhausting. They didn't care if your freight was difficult or larger(larger pieces like back packs, purses, etc means you have to close the boxes more often which takes time away from getting your numbers). The trainer at the time was awful also, which made starting out super frustrating. And the supervisor only got the job because of a college degree, but couldn't pack a box or make prod if she had to."
good,"Management is typically brought in from outside, with no store experience what so ever. They ALL belittle you and put extreme responsibilities on you but give you a very short time frame to do such work. They are all so worried about ""Being brand"" and go by these ridiculous terms they learn out of a book instead of making an effort to do actual work in the store or even attempt to work alongside employees to get their feedback."
good,The employees were pleasant to work with. The upper management not so much. I never felt like I was treated has a valued employee. I was a team lead and was in charge of at least 6-10 people at a time.  On top of my daily routine I was asked to tear and set up plannograms. I feel like the workload they gave some of the team leaders was impossible to accomplish.
good,"Overall Target is amazing to work for. The culture at my store unfortunately took a turn for the worse, and the availability for growth was not there."
good,Hard to move up at the store I was at and management didn't know how to run a store. They would hire people even though the employees they had didn't get any hours.
good,"Working at Target, I feel that I spend a great deal of time here and put in a great amount of effort and that it doesn't really amount to much for me. I feel like there are a lot of employees that have worked with the company for a very long time and are still working the same positions with the same small hours, while the newer, younger employees get almost 40 a week. I do appreciate my job and the money it provides, but there is not much consistency in my day to day responsibilities or routines."
good,this place was not bad just boring. there was no job security here at all. they tell you in the training that they prefer speed over quality. never had any real problems. 10-7 with a 30 min break.
good,It is the typical retail job. You will work weekends and holidays. It is expected of you. You can get a rotating weekend off schedule if you are a team leader or above.
good,"It's ok for a while but you get tired of it. It really depends on the management as well. But, be ready to have no life when you work here. I guess the only benefit is the discount and great finds."
good,Great place friendly manager and overall great company to work for great prices and great products to buy and in a great locatlocation.. would enjoy that company
good,The hardest part of jobs there is that team resources (i.e. ETL-HR) and Store management are only separate in theory. Not really interested in going into it any further than that.
good,Good for students not so good for anybody else. Breaks are 15 to 30 mins long. Easy to master the job and can learn most jobs in a day.Good luck selling the red cards try to be original.
good,"I'm not going to lie I liked my position that I had as a sales associate I like the fact that they would offer goodies so that you can get a customer to sign up for a credit card, but that was it the management there sucked."
good,Fun place to work. Management discriminated  if you were  not in their circle. Management would not promote or have advancement eve if earned if they did not like the ay you looked. They would hire you but not promote if you did not look like them.
good,It wasa good job. Co workers were great and helped when needed. The pay was awful. And the hours were terrible. Management didn't understand needing a personal day off.
good,At the target in Abingdon I was a cashier/Guest Service/ Guest Service Attendant and I was in charge of the cashiers and all customers related issues.
good,"Great part time job.  Busy nearly all the time, days go fast. Good management in general, but pay is pitifully low.  Schedules made well in advance so you can plan your life outside of work. Breaks are often very late."
good,This job was a good job in the sense that it was there for their customers or guests as they would say in store. Yet there are no opportunities for advancement no matter how much they promise and they would train you to move up or be promoted then hire out side the store.
good,"Was promised a full work week, on average only got 18 hours a week . Given the hours nobody else wanted to work. Below minimum wage.  Typical shift consisted of straightening shelves and racks , cover as cashier when lines became to long. Was suppose to help customers but was reprimanded for not coving cashiers on time even though I was helping a customer on the floor."
good,Great target vibe. Not exactly the best place to excell or GROW with. It's very difficult being unable to show your full potential on a daily workload.
good,Target is not open to ideas to improve processes and practices. I am not referring to the store leadership as much as I am talking about corporate. They make decisions that lead to less productivity because they take resources without worrying about how it affects morale and/or performance. Their policies are made by people that are not in touch with reality and have no idea what it takes to get the work done. When subordinates try and give suggestions it is viewed by the upper management (district/group/corporate) as insubordination and is not welcome. They view advancement as doing something else in the store instead of allowing someone to specialize in something they are good at and improve in and promote in. If you are good at something and enjoy doing a specific job or working in a specific area and want to promote you will have to do so in a different area/job.
good,Target is a great place to work and it was a very decent place to work until they started adding more of a work load to team members without any notice or additional pay. Very unprofessional management.
good,Be a favorite. That was the only way you'd get what you wanted working at the Indio target. To bad it closed down. Nithing talked about was ever confidential.
good,"payroll, timekeeping, scheduling, benefits and policies. Worked as cashier when shorthanded. Worked in Electronics and backroom. "
good,"There are different departments in Target, pick the one that you think will keep your interest and you will not get bored or unmotivated easily. Some of the team leaders and management make you feel that you are being watched or are watching you. And I don't really like that. Depending on where you are some of your co-workers are nice and make the job enjoyable."
good,"Good first job to work at. Demands are pretty straight forward and your duties are pretty easy to grasp. I like how you had a big team staff, everyone got a long pretty well"
good,Did every day stretches..Went to assigned mods and distribute items to various stores. Scanned barcodes and put them in the correct box and shipped out boxes
good,"Was a great place to work at. We achieved everything as a team and always supported each other. This is discouraged now however, creating tension and confusion between team members and management."
good,A typical day at work was very fast paced. I would say I made more friends and had more people who cared about me at this job than any other job that I had. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all the work given to you. The most enjoyable was during the mornings we got to listen to music and chat with others while working.
good,"I'm not going to go into much detail about my time at Target, but I will say that management had a sort of tug-of-war going on where some supervisors would say one thing then this one will say another. Relations between average workers was one of the best i've had. For a company that has alot of weight to its name I really did expect better from upper management. And for the record; slashing hours to bare minimum 8-12 hours a week does not make for a positive work environment."
good,Long shifts with huge rushes of people and various slow dips for hours on a typical day of seasonal work. I learned to have a lot more patients with people. Management was touch and go. The culture of the job was work your shift and go home. Hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for 7+ hours. Most enjoyable part of the seasonal position is the free holiday food.
good,"It's overrall a great place, it's just time for me to find something different! I enjoyed it because i got management experience and I learned ways to manage."
good,"The same thing i said before about ""Backroom Target"" is the same thing happening and has been happening for almost 2 years! Other than that there isn't much to say"
good,The work itself is fine and easy just poor management and a lot of false promises for advancements and they treat you like garbage and see you as easily replacabe.
good,"Target prioritizes company success over all else, with decent benefits. It has been a joy and privilege to grow and develop within the company for so long. i am now looking forward to moving into a new location for a fresh start and new challenge."
good,Target is a great company but a job for a young person in school trying earn a little extra money. Not really fun but met some cool people. Management really depends on how you will like the job.
good,The distribution culture differs greatly from store culture. Individuals are not valued for their abilities. No work life balance. Senior leadership is rarely present
good,"it was a chill lay back job"
good,"Some days are very hectic and others can be very slow. Target doesnt have enough employee's to accommodate the amount of traffic that comes through on a daily basis, which is very annoying because you have to do more work than being paid for."
good,"Working a Target was not terrible but, the location I was at , the management was. The shift leaders barely do their job and want to overwork you rather than do it themselves. Then they all smile and laugh in each others faces but then trashtalk the higher up's when they aren't around. the work isn't hard, just stay out of the drama and do your job and you should be fine."
good,"Everything was going well for the first couple weeks. I got enrolled into direct deposit. They said it would be a week or two until it actually came through onto the system. It never did. I had to pick uo my check every two weeks and drive all the way to my bank to deposit it."
good,"Fast Paced, high stress work environment. Many OMs don't make it past their 2 year mark. Lots of politics and senior management is out of touch with reality with what people going on in their lives."
good,"Basically my job is to come in at 6AM to unload the truck, and then stock the store with a team as directed by our supervisor. After about two weeks of this system Target switched to a dedicated stocking system that assigned each individual to stock their own specific area of the store. Mine is Chemical (600 boxes of Tide,Gain, windex) It's exhausting"
good,"The culture is very competitive and stressful. Some stores are good, some are not so good. Some stores have great people to work for- some don't. Very frustrating to work for a company that is so far behind and puts a lot of verbal pressure to take care of its employees but not a lot of actual action."
good,"My favorite part about working at Target is my coworkers.  We have some very funny conversations over our breaks and lunches, and I have developed good relationships with most of them.  My supervisors typically were critical of my team due to high expectations on our productivity.  Ultimately our goal was to stock a truck load of products 5 hours after we open the truck and at times we would run into setbacks.  They were demoralizing and ultimately the biggest con of working there.  I also was only part time at Target and I need to be full time in order to afford going to college and living in an apartment."
good,"I ran the warehouse in all aspects .....Management didn't need to worry weather the work was going to be done because I always finished the work, no matter how much their was."
good,"Its a great starter job, I loved working there for the first year and a half, but then I started noticing things that the management did, which was play favorites to the TL and ETL's and just not care much about the Team Memebers. its supposed to be team based but I had a manager say ""Its only a team when I want it to be."" so if you try to be helpful you can get attacked."
good,Team leaders are to engrossed in moving up the chain without a care for their team members. This makes it hard for team members to work with good morale.
good,"Daily start ups, talk to the team for daily production goal, and express the situations previous shifts encountered so they can be alert. Senior team does not do a good job of supporting managers decisions."
good,"Amazing workers, friendly customers, a place where you would look like you want to work. Be warned, upper management is inconsiderate and treats you as if you are a robot and not a human being. One mess up and you're out of there."
good,"When you work here you basically have to work where ever they tell you to. They don't care if you work in your area and are busy, if something is needed else where you have to go there if they tell you to."
good,target is a good job to work at the store its self is great its the managers who makes it hard to work for target no way to grow and move up the ladder
good,"Target claims to take care of their Team members, but company is more concerned about expansion and bottom line. Benefits constantly being changed for Team members and not for the better."
good,"* Working pulls and unloading freight"
good,Managers throw the majority of the workload of associates. Will typically ask you to extend your shift because they never have enough people on the floor. Always short staffed. Be prepared to work harder and more than you should.
good,"I was a sales associate, so I would stock the shelves, pull the items from the back, also I would zone all areas, making sure the store looks presentable, also would help out on the register to get the customers out in a quickly and friendly matter!"
good,I love Target stores but I happen to work for management in NM that caused employees to work against each others best interest. It was a very physically demanding job lifting boxes opening and unpacking merchandise. Over the holidays they would tell you to work past your scheduled time or you would be let go. It was tiring and disturbing.
good,"Besides the pay, the policies constantly change, the benefits are currently taken away from workers and you have to walk on eggshells around certain group leaders."
good,The work hours were not flexible while attending college. There was not a sufficient amount of training. It was difficult to converse with the managers.
good,"It was okay to work for - the stress I couldn't take because the  expectations are so high for everyone. Target is obviously going through some change, retail is struggling, and it shows through the  team and stores."
good,"As a whole my time at Target wasn't terrible. It kept me in shape, taught me a lot about the retail world and how to problem solve in those types of environments. The real downside were the incredibly long hours, freezing cold conditions in the stock room, mediocre pay for the amount of work you would do and the hours. There is nothing fun about getting up at 3am."
good,Fun work environment easy fast work good for fast money but not very great for a career I enjoyed all the people and the work I always like helping out customers and completing my job correctly
good,Working at Target was a great experience. The only thing that I did not like was the fact they treat the temp workers badly and the 10 hour shifts. We didn't get any benefits and the job security was almost non-existent. You might as well claim unemployment if you work here.
good,"I've worked different positions at Target since they opened their stores in Southern California. My last position was a FLOW TEAM Member.  I was on the overnight stock team who unloaded the trucks and stocked the stores merchandise before the store opened for regular business hours."
good,"Retail team leader over front end sales and customer service. In charge of change funds, customer complaints, returns, photo services, front area staffing, stocking, making sure areas was clean and orderly, making sure that returns were restocked and store was ready for next day if working night shift. Leader huddles for daily sales goals.  "
good,no comment temporary seasonal employment ending January 2017  gained knowledge of retail store operations and inventory management. worked overnight operations
good,I was a cashier. I cashed customers out and also helped them find what they needed from time to time. I enjoyed helping and interacting with customers. I'm a people person. I do not get frustrated with customers regardless on how irritated they get.
good,"Did not have a great experience here.  I worked for over 1 year and 6 months and I had nothing but resistance from leadership and peers.  my peers were absolutely unsupportive and attacking on all levels.  The store leadership was very immature and they barely acknowledged facts, tasks, and the mature successful areas of running a business.  What's sad,  i left and they are all still there... they constantly look at my linked in.  If you are unhappy do something about it."
good,Unless you kiss up to management you're only gonna get about 20-25 hours a week. The people are nice it's just not possible to pay the bills off 25 hours
good,I was in the deli/Starbucks location and it was a fun job with good coworkers. Typical pay isn't good and Starbucks employees does not receive tips left by customers.
good,A typical day at work at Target is fast paced.  Communication between employees and management is limited.  Co workers are fun.
good,Just had to get started and keep the talking at a low and you will be fine. The management was alright considering there was some trouble with them not letting leave work to go to the Emergency Room when I got hurt while unloading the truck.
good,"Working in Aurora, the hours were fine and the crew was great. However, in Fort Collins the hours were horrible. If you close one night, expect to be there in 8 hours the next morning. You don't get enough help with trying to get your job done, and you are always being brought to others if you are a proficient worker. Students do not get any free will. To them you are an employee, not a full time student."
good,I wish they would care about us more and have the holidays off instead of making us spend time apart from our family. They only care about themselves and make us do slave work.
good,"Basic retail job. Nothing spectacular, nothing really terrible. Management has something to be desired. Many times employees were called by the wrong name even when corrected. You're a worker not an individual."
good,"Low pay, low advance opportunity, upper management has minimal experience where most are hired right out of college and tend to not care about employees needs much"
good,Working Taget was ok at times I did feel like the showed  favoritism to certain people and the schedule was not flexible mangers where not motivating at all
good,Then it became a world heavy in politics. They bled me dry. Left on good terms but never again. Forced me into doing business with the only person I could trust --- me.
good,"HR accepts your availability change, but then continues to schedule you when you are not available. They'll schedule you just under the minimum hours where they have to provide you with benefits. Some managers are better than others, but overall they kinda all suck. Very very little advancement and the culture is all about red cards."
good,ETLs comes and goes. They will hire anybody. Male employees sagging their pants during normal business hours. Very unprofessional place.
good,"I loved my coworkers, they are what made the job fun to be at. The management is good for the most part but then you get the one person who's #2 and thinks they're the top dog and tries to run it with an iron fist."
good,You must run be able to run around and able to keep up with miscellaneous task given by the director of the department. Job can be stressful.
good,The Job was simple enough and fun co-workers and for the first year we had great management but the management turnover was almost as bad the co worker turn over which was monthly.within 5 months we lost 2 store managers and 3 assist managers. and the ones that followed where so junior in the role i found my self teaching them or going over their head time and time again cause they didn't even know what my job was.At least with my target i've heard good things about others.
good,Great company to work for but the management is everywhere they are always watching you. The management makes you feel like a machine instead of an individual. Great job just not for me
good,"this would be a great place to work if the management didn't away micro manage,I love that we have a ping pong table, I've learned how to always find a positive in a difficult time a typical time a target is a fast pace work zone moving from department to department getting orders filled"
good,too many change goes on at this place and management isn't good at organizing transition.  Management need a real makeover and need to more professional
good,"Great retail store to work for! "
good,"I gave this company everything I had for 7 years. The management in the first 4 years appreciated my daily efforts. Then those Group leaders left and they were replaced with college grads with no transitional life experience. For example my last Group leader had a degree in political science. He was the worst boss I have had to this day. At target you will work very hard, get paid pretty good and depending on the group leader may or may not be treated fairly."
good,"Everyone loves all the trendy products available at Target. Working there isnt ""as trendy"", its a typical retail job. They like to see what skills you have and let you do new jobs, but the pay doesnt increase with those new experiences. Again, benefits are probably only for management."
good,Good way to make friends. Very late nights. Sometimes you wont get out till 1 or 2am. Managers are awful and rude and dont care about you or your needs.
good,This is good for people who are in school. Flexible hours and easy work. No real money to be made and advancement is usually based on the good old boy system.
good,"I loved working there, but my feet and back consistently hurt. I am dissapointed that something that they did not go over with me is the reason i was fired and now no one else wants to hire me. coworkers were great, customers were rude."
good,"They have started cutting hours back,only giving me 12 to 20.I try to take shifts but not many people want to give up their shifts because they dont get mant either"
good,"Target is a great store and not a bad place to work, the management is just lacking in some areas. The scheduling, compensation, and appreciation standards are low as well."
good,Many of the team leads would tell us what to do in a disrespectful manner that would be upsetting. When we were backed up with things that we needed to do they would stand around just micro managing instead of getting their own hands dirty.
good,I loved my co workers at this job they were very helpful with preparing the food and cashing out customers. We had a lot of trainings for the health concerns and things it was helpful.
good,"I think they are users, and abusers of the employees. They made me take FMLA because I brought in an Doctors note that said I have STRABISMUS, not good 3.D Vission. And I had surgery for it when I was 5 yrs old. And to top it off I did not get compensation for that time I was forced to take off. I had to use Vacation Days. "
good,"I worked in the back room organizing the over stock onto the shelves and also brought the overstock back to the floor to work it on to those shelves too. I cleaned, helped customers, and fixed mods as well."
good,This was the job I had before I left for training for my job in the U.S. Military. I enjoyed what I did; I was good at what I did and I enjoyed the time with the people I spent my shifts with which made my experience all the better. I wish I could have continued on with that company but I had other aspirations I was in pursuit of.
good,All i have to say about the job here for me is that the management felt fake and forced and my hours where never guaranteed and often shortened.
good,"Management was hard to deal with, sometimes they were never around when you needed help.  A typical day at work, was clocking in getting on a register and just working.  They had their favorites, the favorites didn't have to do anything really.  There was so much gossip going on, everyone partied together.  What I learned was everything there there is to know about Target, however I had to learn on my own.  The most enjoyable part was when I got to finally get to play the part of the supervisor.  I felt I deserved it, I had worked so hard for so long for it."
good,"The managers are all over the place, not enough employees to help get the job done.  They are constantly cutting hours then adding when they please."
good,"The management at this location does not encourage employee engagement. "
good,As I stated it's ok to work there but not my idea of career advancement. this job is more for the young people starting out when I worked there it was part time the pay was not for me.
good,"The job was simple as long as you worked with a sense of urgency. Sometimes received shipments were unpredictable, but for the most part my leaders tried to be accommodating. I got along with everyone. It was only 4 hours a day usually, but I'm still grateful to have the job experience under my belt now. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the new bosses. They had zero experience in the department, but were transferred over because they already worked for Target. They were convinced their new way of doing things was going to fix any issues we sometimes had. They were wrong and chased many employees away from the job."
good,"a typical day at work is very stressful. walking into work just makes me want to quit. starting work at random times everyday and sometimes for only 4 hours is disappointing. I have been working for this company for so many years and I honestly don't even know how I have survived. maybe if the pay was be better, I wouldn't mind it so much."
good,"The company seems fine on the outside but to many people are advanced because of favoritism and friendship, and as such there is very little responsibility at the manager and up level. everything is blamed on the team members at the bottom whether they have adequate management, time, realistic goals, etc."
good,"Target was a fun job to work at. each guest you meet is never the same. I typical day include answer phone, finding items cashing guest out returns pull from stock room and clean before store close"
good,"Advancement is solely based on a college degree. Although most grads don't have the necessary skills when first entering the job. Advancement should be on the ability to lead and do the work no matter if one went to college. College is great, but in some fields it doesn't amount to a hill of beans...like target. A team lead who is moved from just being a peon has the ability to not only understand the job but can also lead the team."
good,I work on the sales floor most of the time and I make sure the the store is clean and looks nice for the guests. My coworkers are very nice and we get along well. It's a good job to have when you need experience in the working field and to get yourself started.
good,"We did it all.  We unloaded trucks, stocked the sales floor, back stocked surplus freight, did basic customer service, and often times in a 4 to 6 hour period.  The hardest part was getting up at 3a.m. "
good,Spend the first 4 hours pushing out as much freight as you can then go to break and spend the rest of the night trying to keep up with the rest of the department you were assigned to.
good,"Great place to work. People are wonderful. Co works are helpful. Management works wells with us, to ensure that we have coverage all the time."
good,"It was a basic job. A lot of politics within levels of management within the store I worked at. Never wanted to utilize employees abilities, so burnouts were high, and they always sided with favorite employees regardless of situations."
good,"Well I worked on Flow team which if you're unfamiliar is the Stock crew who unloads the trucks, sorts the boxes into different departments of the store, delivers those boxes to the departments, takes the product from the boxes and sorts them even more, scans the product and finds it rightful place on the shelf or rack or hook, etc. The hardest part of my job was honestly training my body to wake up at 4am every day because work started promptly at 5am every morning and it was brutally rough for someone who is not a morning person like myself. However, if you are an early riser go getter than you'll love this job! Most enjoyable part about the job is that I got off work earlier than all of my friends... 2pm was everyone's favorite time in the day! The only thing that kind of sucks is that Target pays terribly... so if you're in highschool and looking for a first time job this is for you... If you're an adult trying to get on your feet and hitting the ground running... Don't waste your time!"
good,Target is a great place to work during the holidays because they stay busy witch means you stay busy. They don't mind teaching anything that you want to learn in the fields that they offer. Guest service is always valuable.
good,It is a very good place to work.  We generally picked up things that were not where they belonged and helped customers.  The hardest part of the job was walking around the entire store at the end of the night shift.
good,I meant to only work at Target to gain some more work experience but ended up staying there longer than I intended.  If you have to option to work somewhere else I highly reccomend working elsewhere.
good,This job is good for high schoolers or college students.  Because they just offer about 30 hours max.  No benefits and not that busy so its very slow paced.
good,"very light easy work."
good,"Target was a blast to work at when it came to working with people. The team members you will meet at the Keizer target are some of the nicest individuals and allow for some great social aspects. There is almost no drama compared to a regular place of work, and almost everybody gets along. The managers can be incredibly overbearing however, especially considering they do a completely lousy job of management. The store has been barely able to keep itself in what they call the ""green zone"" which is their word for good sales. They keep the place clean and work together well and communicate well. They just have a tendency to create more problems by blowing small ones out of proportion. They make the job more difficult with unnecessary decisions that are unplanned. There is almost no advancement as a regular worker unless you want to work there for the rest of your life. I met guys there thirty years old who had worked for Target for nine coming on ten years and was in my same position... a rookie truck member just recently hired on. You can try your way up through other department, but goodluck at that since management chooses to hire exterior managers from out of state stores rather than hire anyone in the store itself, waiting for that position. Pay is lousy for the amount of work and speed you are required to do it, beyond that pay raises are a joke there. Overall I absolutely loved my coworkers and environment working at Target, but as for a long sustaining place of employment to work for, nu uh."
good,Target was a very fun fast paced enviroment. Good opportunity to strengthen customer service  and sales skills. Very family friendly environment.
good,"If you consult for Target, the actual employees will insult you on a daily basis.  They will never hire you, unless you did an Internship with the University of Minnesota."
good,"A typical day at Target consisted of helping guest find products that they cannot find. Also, preping, and serving food to hungry guests."
good,You were either harassed to get Red Cards from customers or made to sign up for one yourself. Low pay with little hours makes it hard to actually live with this job. Management wasn't all too encouraging and was slow to help with time off.
good,I hated unloading the truck  it wears you out. You unload truck then stock the store. You work 4am til 10am  and they don't ask u to stray the tell u u have to
good,"a typical day at work for me is to clock in, then check in with my LOD (leader on duty), I've learned many things at target for one how to take more criticism from my employers, to even customers. I also learned to be more independent and adjust to the schedule given to me. My co-workers are great and very friendly and provide great team work when needed. The hardest part of my job for me is having the ability to  sell our credit/debit cards in which is not my favorite part of working. Although my favorite part of working  is the customers and getting to interact with everyone and just being able to help others"
good,Working Mornings Normally The Managers will start with a Briefing educating The Team Members on what conclusion we can come up with to improve on our sales and also recognizing our Piers on their work task they have completed. Afternoons is the busies so our main focus is on the guest making sure they finding exactly what they want or help them find another target that has what they want. Closing Shifts we would Focus on Branding the store like putting back items in the right location and sometimes the managers will have a Contest on the first Team Member to finish first would get a prize.
good,"From my experience, the people you work day to day with are great and helpful. When it comes to the management of this store however, you are better off talking to a brick wall. Very few of them have any business sense and in fact, even fewer use common sense. They consist of several, fresh out of college non business school graduates, whom have never had Retail management experience. Found myself knowing way more about their job functions then they knew about mine, which lead to many frustrating situations and heated discussions. This store would certainly benefit from hiring a management team whom have obtained a business degree or have had relevant experience in this industry. Overall, if you can handle the barrage of ignorance that would be coming your way, then apply."
good,As a cashier you inter-act with many types of people. Hard work lifting heavy items. But overall a good work enviroment.
good,"I stayed with this company far longer than I should've only because of the coworkers. Management started off OK but over the years went to total garbage and started treating everyone pretty terribly, and raises were always tiny for everyone not in management, regardless of performance."
good,"I liked the system, but management locked down on a lot that was personal opinion not policy."
good,"The orientation was awesome! It gets you excited to be a part of such an awesome team. However, the orientation is like the advertisement, once you begin to interact with the workers, you gradually find out the true image of the job. You deal with more attitudes and chiefs, everyone wants to tell everyone what needs to be done, but no one once to follow are learn and understand one another. When you try to encourage a positive atmosphere, the veterans quickly discourage it. You leave the job exhausted from work and negativity."
good,Great place to gain experience for future jobs and careers. Opportunities for growth will have to be something you have to look and fight for on a daily basis. I've gained a sense of leadership in every position i have with help from my fellow team leaders. The hardest part of the job is trying to move up in the company.
good,"Nice place to work, Could have better management to help things run smother, Cashiering is fun and clothing and shoes are always a mess."
good,"Since Target is one of those corporate giants, it's understandable that they're not really going to care about their employees. I started working at Target for the season (Christmas) which was pretty insane. Like similar establishments, it seemed like many of my coworkers didn't have very much initiative or drive to go the extra mile, the management was the same way. They didn't really care about what you had to say about much and since I was seasonal they knew I was going to be gone anytime soon. This is a good job if you are in high school and want to earn a little cash and gain experience, not staying there forever."
good,"Working at Targegt is Not Bad, its the same routine everyday and they are all about teamwork and helping guests. The hours are very short. The guest are extremely nice. Management is overall friendly."
good,The hardest part is the fact the productivity must increase all the time without proper compensation and increased workforce.
good,Ok place to work but not at all what I had expected. The people I worked with were great but the whole enviroment was not that great. I worked there for three years and gained a lot of knoweledge that I needed.
good,"Target is a strong company with a proven track record, they are going through some must needed changes right now and I hope they can get the layoffs over with and life back to normal."
good,"its an okay place to work while youre in school. my coworkers are fun to work with but the management isnt all that great. hardest part of the job is pulling the cafs, most enjoyable parts of the job is the morning and evening huddles when we talk about our sales and we get food"
good,I felt out of place with my coworkers that worked there full time. It was kind of like being treated like a child because we all had the same responsibilities and skills.
good,"The employees are separated into cliques like it's Mean Girls. The management doesn't care if you were in a car accident on Christmas Eve, they want to know if you're still coming into work. My favorite part about this job was the day I quit."
good,target as a company will not give you hrs 130 people on the schedule only 23 would be considered full time all else 12 to 20 hrs.
good,"Work life balance is really hard to have in retail and being a new ETL you want to do well, so you spend a lot of hours at work plus the workload can be pretty heavy."
good,"A typical day of work is I come in, during evening hours when most busy. I get carts of re-shop to restock the shelves with. I put the items in the carts back, and then I start zoning. Zoning is making certain areas, of the store your assigned, look nice and neat. Then I usually have to cover electronics during my hours, and I have to backstock in the backroom and pull items out of the back for guest."
good,Pretty good job! Hours are consistent and job security is good! The best part of the job is getting to work with the local police departments and having a great security team.
good,I don't have much to say about Target as It was a very random situation.  I enjoyed the small amount of training I received and the company culture was great.
good,"Didn't mind the work. I really enjoyed my team. I learned a lot of different positions in different stores that I feel will help me in the future including logistics, facilities management, guest service, and more."
good,"Hours are flexible when part-time, so that's good. Working here is average, most daily issues stem from dealing with unsatisfied customers."
good,I didn't enjoy target to much the management is what is really nerve racking they don't seem to care to much about their employees just the numbers.
good,The employees are generally great as coworkers but management definitely shows favoritism. The benefits are nonexistent but that's typical in retail.
good,"Target is a good place to start when your young. Not a lot of room to grow, they like to hire from outside the company. They do not like to give you set hours."
good,A typical day at my job would consists of me supervising a minimum of 8-10 cashiers. I have to address the guest to any of the cashiers that don't have anyone. What I have learned is that you can't please everyone as much as I've tried. My co-workers I have grown to love and gotten to know them. The hardest part of the job is when you have try to please everyone and they aren't satisfied. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to see there smiles on there faces.
good,"My typical day at work would consist of me walking the entire/area of the store depending if I'm LOD or GSTL.  I would break the team off into areas and give them their tasks for the day.  I would partner with all leaders in the building to see what their focuses will be for the day and what will their team be focusing on.  I would check sales and payroll to give the team updates on sales and forecast for the day.  I would check my email and redwire to share any information with the team that they may need to know.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with disrespectful guest that speak to you with no respect, and still remaining professional. The most enjoyable part of my job is providing great guest services and receiving that feedback from the guest."
good,"Not too much to say. Seasonal employment for back to school, work with money, help out customers. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't enough for me."
good,"Typical retail setting.  Target DOES NOT give good wages and does not promote and increase salary appropriately.  Hence, I resigned."
good,"This company is great to work for if you need a part time job while going to school or just want a few hours a week. There are many college students that work there so its a really great environment for younger people. The pay is minimum wage so you have to be fine with that however you can earn extra money by getting customers to open a Target card. In the off season your hours could be cut drastically. Sometimes you may even get one shift a week. You must be able to handle a busy work environment, during busy store hours there will be a lot of work to be done and lots of cleaning and prep work after the store closes for the night"
good,"stock shelves, communicates with customer, keep the work place clean, communicates with upper management , cashier, organizes the store merchandies and products"
good,"I had many AMAZING years at Target..."
good,"A typical day at target would be working had, always busy, and helping people. I've learned how to deal with a lot of different situations and different cultures. The management was nice, most of the co-workers did their job on time. The hardest pat of the job was helping a guest that was having a bad day, but I enjoyed making them smile & brightening up their day. even if it was just for a second."
good,"Restocked the store and helped through the season. It was a good place to work but the job was only seasonal. Night time was the best time to work, no customers, just straight work."
good,"As the summary says, its an easy job, but management is kinda bad. Too many corporate rules to follow, so they ride on their employees sometimes when they really don't need to."
good,"Fun fast and friendly, never a dull moment at target, always being challenged with different people, great people to work with"
good,"An OK job coming out of highschool. Management needs improvement. Some employees are great to work with, others make your job harder. Great place to work on guest service."
good,"Typical retail environment. Management requires too much hands on work, that doesn't allow time for real management work. Best practices are constantly changing."
good,Started off as a great place to work. It was a busy environment.  They took pride in the appearance of their store and encouraged us to take pride in our work.  However the company went into receivership and will be closing.
good,"I began working at Target for the Holiday season in which I was ecstatic about joining their team originally. I felt how nice the employees were while shopping there so I felt it would overall be a good fit for a while. A typical day at work involved ringing guest up and adapting to faced paced environments, which was no an issue for me at least. Also we had to do janitorial work as all the cashiers were mainly girls, we were told to clean the women bathroom while the guys that pushed carts were told to do the mens. If you were to get anything incorrect which is NORMAL as a new employee, the managers would raise their voices and talk about you to other managers. Also, I had an experience where a manager and guest knew each other and the manager had told the guest that I had recently messed up someone's order and in return the guest yells ""NO SHE ISNT RINGING ME UP THEN, YOU ARE!"" Just beware, maybe this only happens to seasonal."
good,"Target a nice job for students. I do not see many opportunities to move up in the company. I would arrive at 3am or 4am."
good,"I have been successful in my current role as the driving force of promoting a prevention culture through educational awareness and collaboration with law enforcement. At Target I have been fortunate to have access to amazing resources like the National Investigation Centre, Asset Protection Business Partners, Field Investigators, and Special Investigation Units."
good,"Great place to get my feet wet in the retail industry. Lots of training opportunities, and resources available.  Technology is state of the art."
good,"Loved Target! Great Company, not so great executive leadership team. Pay is okay, but you definitely deserve more money for the amount of work you do."
good,"Working there was very physical, invloved a lot of lifting and walking around and pulling and moving stuff.  Co workers were ok, some were quite lazy and never really did the job or didnt want to stay to finish the work.  This type of work requires a lot of strength and patience.  I enjoyed learning new things and meeting new people.  The hardest thing about it was being able to get some point across to leaders because there was favourtism and no accountability for some people who were not doing their job."
good,They want way more out of you than the job is worth you don't get your breaks like you should get them at a real job this is all I have to say about this job
good,This company is understaffed! I have learned that you kinda have to go with the flow and deal with what you have to work with. Management has a good attitude and is always willing to help. Hardest part of my job is to have employees want to take command from the new leader. The most enjoyable part of my job is the guest. I love helping them in any way I can.
good,"Management was terrible, but can be looked passed by the people you end up working with. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out what exactly you needed to be doing. I can only speak for this specific Target."
good,"Target is a place where the upper management doesn't care about the employees, and struggle to keep morale up. Their turn over rate is very high."
good,"Working for Target can be a good experience.  It depends on the store and the management working in that store.  Turnover is high and management can change quickly, turning a store that is a joy to work for into one you look forward to leaving."
good,The manager was absolutely fantastic!! But the other employees were rude and unhelpful when guidance was needed. They offered assistance when none was needed and would ignore you when assistance was needed. There were too many employees and not enough hours to give. They would often call you the day before and cancel your shift for the next day so you can go for weeks without working.
good,Management are not very friendly. Does not appreciate hard work and effort.
good,"Working at Target is difficult. It is not the job it's self that is difficult it is the work environment that makes things difficult. The management is questionable. Finding out simple informations such as work hours for the week, a simple task becomes a daunting one. There are books that are set out in the break room that has the hours for the week, but that is the only way you can figure out when you work-and even then it might not be a guarantee. There have been times where I have been scheduled to work and it was not posted in the book so I was unaware and was ""written up"" for not showing up for a shift I did not know I had. They are obsessed with selling redcards and if you don't sell enough, you get ""written up"". You don't make commission on redcards you simply just have to sell them to people who don't want to buy them. As a cashier I constantly was yelled at by customers for things I could not control such as expired coupons. It is very emotionally exhausting working at Target."
good,Lack of leadership and lack of attention to detail. Attention to detail on mistakes rather than achievements. Leaders don't take in employee opinions when trying to fix a problem. Numbers are more important that try to fix problems.
good,"Coming into the role, was excited to be apart of this company.  HR did a great job on beginning stages of paperwork, communication and orientation ( a little too much orientation in hindsight - pages of courses and 'group work' to do when your trying to assimilate yourself into your new role and culture)."
good,"When I first started working at Target, it wasn't bad at all. For three years in fact it wasn't that bad. However, once our store got a bad Store Manager, things fell apart quite quickly. I left, because even though we got a much better Manager, things were just very slowly getting better. "
good,out going fun fast pace helping customers communication cool enviornment
good,"I have worked in a retail position for four years. Target is a company that is ever-changing and grows with its employees continually. One of the positive of this type of employment is being able to sharpen your people skills (i.e., customer relations, dealing with conflict, etc.)"
good,"Hard working position, Good Part time minimum wage job only. "
good,"Management : Refuses to acknowledge classes for college and any outside changes to Availability. What you sign up for on availability you are stuck with forever. Managers will tell you to stop talking and get back to work but insist on standing around and not assisting, will not practice what is preached. "
good,"Most of management are right out of college and very young, Good company but benefits and hours could be much better."
good,"this was a seasonal overnight job"
good,"While working at Target I learned a lot about myself and how I react and communicate with others, co-workers and customers. A typical day as a cashier at Target would be an eight-hour or more shift with minimal breaks/lunches as well as being kind and courteous to each guest you meet. Management was average but difficult at times, punishing team members if they had to call out because they were sick as well as ignoring team members school schedules as over 50% of team members at the Flagstaff Target are active students. The hardest part of the job was occasionally having to deal with very difficult guests and making sure their every request was satisfied. My co-workers were one of the best parts of the job. There was a sense of camaraderie between us as we were the lowest on the totem pole. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to meet French tourists and do their entire transactions in French."
good,"A typical day at work I'll usually interact with guests and make sure their needs are being met. I'll also restock the shelves and clothing racks. I have been taught to organize the shelves to make it easier for the guests to find exactly what they were looking for. I've learned a range of things, from thinking on the spot to zoning to the guidelines of a planogram."
good,"Target is supposed to be a friendly company, and I'm sure that it is. However, when I worked for Target in Cedar Hill, I had a different experience than what is advertised. The majority of my coworkers were brutally harsh and nasty (not just to other coworkers, but to clients and even superiors). Everyone got away with everything (unless they were doing a good job, in which case they were scolded and nitpicked), and ultimately working for Target in Cedar Hill was a huge downer. I stayed for six months and then left and sought a different opportunity."
good,"This company is terrible to work for!  hours are not assigned fairly, often one person is manning the entire sales floor for hours on end.  Needs to schedule more cashiers so that said one person is actually able to stay on the sales floor and actually help the customers.  Shifts are cut without advanced warning.  Very often I arrive at work and try to clock in only to find out that they have cut my shift and I must go home.  Fortunately I don't have t drive very far but if I did this would present a definite aggravation instead of the minor annoyance it is for me..  I would not recommend this company to anybody."
good,Again this was a very fast pace operation employees and management worked together
good,"Typical day at work: Clock in, report to the LOD for your department, clean up areas, work on go-backs, help with back up in the front lanes, re-stock shelves, help guests."
good,"Busy taking care of customers needs, Patience and tolerance from people wanting free stuff. My bosses are great with working with me when I was going to college, and my personal life. I consider my co-workers as family we work as a team when we work together.  Giving excellent customer service to people who want something for nothing. Meeting new people and being of service."
good,"A typical day at Target, I normally start zoning asap when i come in so it will look nice for the guest to see what they are looking for, I also do re-shop i put items back on the shelf what the guest didn't wanna buy and i also answer phone calls. I'm also trained all threw out the store soft lines, hard lines, electronics and guest service."
good,okay job but I'm actively looking. Still working here but I'm open to have a better job title
good,The company it's self is not a bad company to work for it was the management that had favorites as long as your in that click group you have it made.
good,"It was an overall okay job. Management was young an inexperienced and treated you as if you were a child or below them. The hours were inconsistent. You can have 38 hours one week and then 12 the next. Also sometimes you would have to work late and then come in early. And pretty much forget about having a life at home, you will most likely never see the weekends again.  The pay is very low, most of the jobs are below 10. The good part of working at Target were the co-workers who were non-management. Most of them were all good people from all different backgrounds that generally got along with everyone. So Target does come through with a diverse work place."
good,"I've worked at Target for 5 1/2 years and they truly don't care about the employees.  It's about making them look good.  To push target cards which is the store brand credit card was a joke. "
good,It was full of great people that made the job bearable. It was a great guest driven company.
good,"A typical day at work was organizing inventory in the backroom and ensure easy accessibility and locating of products. I learned about how to use and maintain an active inventory system. My immediate supervisor was respectful and understanding. Upper management, however, were less respectful and less attentive to our needs. Coworkers were energetic and fun. The hardest part of the job was accomplish upper managements, sometimes, unrealistic goals. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all my coworkers and making some lifetime friends."
good,"A typical day at Target changes from day to day. The work you do is not limited to what your job description is. You could be working on the sales floor one day, the cashiers the next day, and even groceries the next. I have learned how to deal with costumers; the friendly ones, and more importantly, the rude ones. The management does not communicate, and there are a lot of mixed directions. Co-workers are nice for the most part. It is a place where you can make friends. The hardest part about working at Target is that management does not know how to do every job, so if a question comes up that they are not familiar with, they can not answer. The most enjoyable part of the job is that if you know what you are doing, management will leave you alone to work."
good,"PICK ORDERS to be ship out, loaded and unloaded shipments. Great team environment everyone pulled together to get the job done. Learned how to be very productive and work together."
good,"The typical day at Target was usually 1 of 2 things I would help unload and push out merchandise from the truck. Then the other part of the job, I would go to working on the plano load. That consist of setting new aisles in the store for the new merchandise out. I would also help out customers whenever able to do so. My supervisor, Dolly Dinwiddie, was great to work with and talk to about any problems I had. The other supervisors/management weren't the greatest at all, most would sit around and not do anything. My co-workers are great people to work with and great people to know. The hardest part of the job most of the time was working with customers who were just hard to work with for whatever reason. The most enjoyable part of my job was working the plano team themselves everyday."
good,"Target used to be a great company, with strong values and a bias for its employees.  Now it is all about making money, at the expense of compensation and benefits.  Stores are always understaffed, and management is recruited almost exclusively from outside the company, which limits promotional opportunities for hourly supervisors and restricts the amount of ""wisdom"" retained in stores.. new people with no previous experience running the show."
good,I didn't really like how some coworker would treat the customers when they needed help.
good,"Replenishment team, stocking the floor with merchandise for customer satisfaction. Assisting guest with all their consumer needs."
good,"A typical day at work was dealing with guest and providing great guest service.  Working at Target I've learned to always do the right thing.  Management had poor work ethics.  Co-workers were fun to work with and made life easier to work as a team.  Hardest part of my job was dealing with a non compliant, rude guest.  Enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"very hectic busy workplace, patients are very needy, hard to understand language barrier.i have learned alot from this place,"
good,Nothing particularly great to say about them other than the stores cleanliness.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of keeping my area clean and tidy, working cooperatively with other Target team members and helping customers find whatever they were looking for."
good,"management always pushing for more, while not giving you what you need to get more."
good,"This company is going down quickly, no internal promotions"
good,Nothing too strenuous depending on how the managers decide to act towards you. Work hours can be strange. It's not a bad place but management has their favorites and if you're not one of them you will be alienated.
good,"Target was a great company to start with when I was 16 years old. They were extremely flexible with my schedule and were very accommodating when I was balancing high school and working part time. They are very demanding of their employees during the holiday season, but I expect that they would be because of the increase in sales through those particular months. They also allowed me to go on leave of absence at different times to go to college and work when I would return for breaks."
good,"Working for Target included money handling, customer service, and customer satisfaction. The hardest part of the job was the down time in between rushes. The most difficult part of the job was being understaffed during the holidays."
good,"I have worked for Target for almost five years now and the best part of the company is the camaraderie that you build with other team members. I really enjoy being at work for who I am there with. I usually will do everything you could possibly think of at work, from helping guests to pulling items from the back room. You name it, I'm trained to do it. It really makes the time go by faster."
good,"everyday i was usually the first one in the building. i had a personal set of store keys. i ran the truck process for general merchandise and the food truck. unloading, stocking, and backstocking product. i was responsible for a team of about 30. hardest part of my job was was making sure everything was done according to the process and meeting deadlines. most enjoyable part would have to be interacting with my team and being apart of something bigger and trying to make a difference."
good,"Target at least provides medical benefits for part timers, however they rule with an iron fist (militant work environment)."
good,"Consistent customer interaction"
good,Not very good management and room to grow. have nothing else to say.
good,"Theres a lot of chiefs and not enough indians."
good,"there is no union, no equality. management fighting due to lack of communication. Respect is to be earned, and not many benefits."
good,It was a fun environment. However the pay could of been way better..
good,I liked the job and the people i worked with however management didnt seem to care much about or be involved much with their employees. I did not feel as though i could come to them for anything.
good,"I work in the mobile department. It's a pretty easy job and laid back job. There is a lot of down time, unfortunately."
good,"As a Flow team member there are early shifts and a lot of lifting and bending.  Working with the apparel departments the duties include unpacking and sorting apparel by departments and then stocking merchandise."
good,Position required travel to perform field testing at locations around the  U.S. This was often inconvenient for me as lowest ranking in the team I would not get much notice. Previous position in the company was as an Administrative Assistant so managers often would put those tasks upon me rather than the department Admin. Politics in the company made this a very tough department to work in.
good,"Day to day I was responsible for daily sales and general upkeep of target mobile kiosk. I was to keep everything in order and operating as if it was my own store. I trained employees coached them and of course supervised their daily activities. This also included helping guests with non-mobile transactions. "
good,"I worked in the Electronic Department. It was fun except on Black Friday. Every now and then, some rude customers."
good,"When I first started this job I really loved it. I learned ALOT of useful techniques to help me advance in the company. My managers were all very helpful and encouraging. But a lot has changed since then, 3 years ago. Now the company has gone into a huge slump. Hours have been cut dramatically, healthcare is no longer provided, and all of the management has just gotten lazy and uncooperative. They don't care about the well-being of their employees or the operations going on in the store. It's really un-motivating and not enjoyable anymore."
good,A typical day at work includes unloading the truck and stocking the store. Very repetitive
good,"my typical night of work was unloading a 2500-3000 piece truck. i learned that when you work well, management holds you at a  different expectation. my co-workers were good people just honest people like me. the hardest part of the job where the long 10 hour shifts over night and being so far from home; and i feel the most enjoyable part of the job will be when im able to leave."
good,Good around holidays. Hours are next to nothing through out most of the year. AP is always first to go be careful.
good,"A typical day working at Target Guest Services is very fasted paced.  In Guest Services you work directly with the customers helping to resolve various issue dealing with products and services. "
good,"The job itself is great, the hours are good and the pay is alright. But the store can use better management. The workers don't seem to care about the presence of their customers, and the management really stinks; they have no regard for discipline of bad employees. The co workers are very sneaky and lazy at their jobs; they won't even acknowledge that a customer is present and are very rude."
good,"productive workplace"
good,Great place to get experience in working with the public. Learned a lot by working behind Guest Service
good,The hourly wage left a lot to be desired as far as work to pay was concerned you were pushed to your physical limits...
good,very less pay. less chances to grow; too much work load. its nice place to work good atmosphere managers are nice as well.
good,target is a fun company to work for. Its a great company to work for as a first job. But there is not much growth with this company
good,"Chipotle is a good fast food place, they have great services."
good,started off great turn bad soon no team support they had me do all the work while they got all the praise
good,"You clocked in, do your job, stay busy, take scheduled breaks, clock out."
good,"A typical day for me included answering emails and phone calls, computer work, creating schedules for the team to follow, interacting with vendors through email and phone, helping team members ship their items internationally, and any other customer service duties that came up.  "
good,Loved the company until the change of hours.I prepped the store for sales and changed the aisle around .
good,Bad place to work retail and things could be better. Target could keep the employee areas neat and clean.
good,"Fun, good team environment. Workload was too heavy for one employee. Management had unrealistic goals."
good,"A typical day at work would usually begin with me assisting customers throughout the store in various depts. such as register, customer service, electronics, and wherever else as needed. Management often didn't address problems as often as needed due to needs in others depts., but there were never any situations that I saw get too out of hand."
good,Was not very satisfied with working for this Target. ( Hillsdale Ave in San Jose) The management team wasnt very good. They were extremely rude and did not train very well.
good,"Lack of advancement, horrible hours, short staffed, open door policy doesnt exist."
good,"Typical day- All operations are driven to bring in guests regardless of  resources (especially manpower)."
good,working there as a cashier in the area of predominantly Hispanic and Caucasian it was very hard to find growth with the company at this location. and it was hard to get hours of work during the holiday and new hire season.
good,"I experienced both great and abhorrent work culture during my time here.  It can varry greatly. "
good,My responsibilities include but are not limited to maintaining a clean and functional sales floor. Providing accurate and courteous customer assistance as needed. I go above and beyond my duties for the customer to insure that they experience a pleasant shopping experience. I also process various monetary transactions as cashier.
good,Nothing really to say about Target Just that it was My first Job and It made me realize that you have to do things on your own. I enjoy the cashier because It was my first time and I love when I talk to people. Co workers were some what of friendly I only knew 3 people out of 25. Hardest Part was When Customers came to me I really didn't know where surrent area were so I would had to ask one of the co workers but they would have a Attitude about it.
good,"it really depends on your store if you will be in a good spot or not. The management in this store is very ""backstabby"" and outright rude at times."
good,"I had an eight hour shift five days a week. The hours were great. They pay not so much. I was getting paid minimum wage which was $7.75 per hour for every two weeks. The management was not too satisfying. They were not very friendly, no smile at all. At the end of the day i enjoyed my time there because it was the people i worked with and the customers. They all made my day."
good,"Provide guest service, cleaned, prepared food, followed food safety standards, and filled food temperature log."
good,"I've worked for Target for 3 yrs. A typical day for me is making sure the pulls for my area has been put out and any remaining products will be placed as back stock. My managers are good hard working people. As for my co workers there are new faces that have been hired. I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I find it difficult. I've had a co worker give me bad attitude and have seen how products that should have been put on the shelves hidden behind the rest of the products. The hardest part of my job is picking up the slack from others who have the attitude of doing only part of their job. The most enjoyable part is getting to meet the customers who come into the store."
good,management was not efficient to work with but other coworkers where great to work with. They had potential but was not appreciated when they should have been or even giving recognition when needed. Also just the way they handled business with there employees.
good,"did something different everyday which was a plus"
good,"My time with Target Co. has been a mediocre experience. The opportunity for growth and development seems to be minimal, as well as the level of  efficiency. It would make for a decent ""first- time"" job , but I am in search of growth and advancement."
good,the co-workers were great but management was one sided and did not care about the employees to much
good,"Target Stores is a very rough place to work, typically drastically understaffed, with 4-8 different managers telling you 4-8 diferent things needing to done at the same time."
good,"Although I loved the team, The more you give the company the more they wanted.  If you were an overachiever they expected but those who could not measure up were allowed to deliver below par and not challenged to deliver like those who already consistently did so.  They continue to take more of the resources and request more from the associates.  Example cut payroll but sales are increasing along with the truck flow."
good,"Was fired for missing one day for my car being stolen. HR told me I was fine two weeks later they let me go. Hr or my manager didn't fire me, they had someone that didn't even know my name nor any of my information do it. All he did was tell me to call Hr with any questions. Called HR 3 times and left messages, to this day have not gotten any call backs. Did not receive any training while here, but they expected you to meet standards. Also displays favoritism in employees as well"
good,check emails go over the task list of the day. The hardest part was when you ask for help cause  you know the work load is big and no one listens. The co-workers are all nice and helpful if you need the help.
good,management demanded more with little to work with.  management not supportive  every manager had a different way of doing things hard to get on a program with so many chiefs and very few indian's. Not a fun place
good,"Typical Executive work day would include about 14 hours a day of running store. The position gives you a lot of experience running a retail type environment but lacks work life balance. "
good,The hours were good but the pay was not nearly enough based upon the work they had you doing there.
good,I learned that I have to move fast in order to get the job done.
good,"It's retail. So you will start off with good hours then they'll decrease over time and without notice. You're also hired for one position but end up doing at least 3 or 4, for the same pay, which is always low."
good,"A typical day at Target as a cashier was a fast, fun, and friendly environment. I learned how to be efficient with helping guests with product questions I was able to use my sales ability to promote each and every guest to get a red card and or want one. I learned about diversity in the work place through working with many different people, manager levels and hands on experience in various departments. On occasion I was given the responsibility to manage the front end of the store."
good,"Target, among large retail stores, is one of the best to work for, however, it is still not a great experience. Not only are my employees really unreliable (large call-off percentage), the management does not attempt to recover from the damage. "
good,"It was a fun filled experinece that was short lived only becauase of the amount it payed was not enough to live on, plus it was a seasonal job. The managment was professional though kept the flow of the day interesting, by maintaining new and different responisiblities each and everyday."
good,"I have a daily routine of stocking and fixing shelves, serve as a cashier, assisting customers, etc. The management is okay, could be better as far as leadership from authority. My co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is the amount of tasks that has to be completed daily in a specific time frame."
good,"Very fast paced, always on the go, load and unload trucks and enter material into inventory system, deliver materials to all employee,s out on the floor and up in the office. I did enjoy the various culture of the employee,s, learned the monarch software system and many other things with in the company. I think because the company was so big many things were out of order, mainly decision making. My co-workers were of various ethnicity and I did enjoy that a lot. Hardest part of my job was standing on concrete for 12 hours a day, feet were sore some days. Most enjoyable part of the job was everyday was a different day and I was always learning more about the printing industry which I like a lot, knowledge is good."
good,Working as a team leader for target was one of the worst working experiences I have ever had. You have to many goals that do not help the overall profit of the store. You would think saving payroll and making sales would be enough but it is not. If one of your scores went yellow the STL and ETL would act like it was the end of the world. My STL would take me to the side and use profanity to express her concerns with my teams performance. I know that a lot of bosses are like that but when you make so little money it is hard to take that kind of back lashing.  
good,"A typical day at target for me is checking and responding to all emails, getting a plan of action for the day, who is in place for business. Then I set up the work center and collaborate with my peers to follow up on changes or new information. I maintain a clean, organized and happy work center as each customer is treated with amazing service and follow up. Repeat customers and knowing the names of most of  the regulars are what make it a great experience at Target. I strive for that and make sure that our team is on board with that expectation. The hardest part of my job is not always having the support needed to run a great store. The most enjoyable part are the people I work with amazing people and love to hear what people have to share.     "
good,"Working in a corporate setting is not as satisfying for me.  A typical day for me now includes me opening the front end of the store, this means I open registers and put money in them, prepare the front end for guests to start arriving, and make a break schedule for the team of up to twenty people who I will be managing that day.  I answer the phones, assist guests, and help my team members with any challenges that they encounter.  I keep track on supplies that we use daily, and do hour checks for things such as bags for product to leave the store in, trash cans outside, carts to be pushed inside to make available for guests, clean restrooms, etc.  I find our management team does not work well together. The personalities and type of professionalism differs too greatly for my superiors to work together to benefit the team.  Team morale has gone down and communication is broken.  It is difficult for me to find support from leaders because of this.  My peers are experiencing the same challenges, but are great support to me as much as they can be. The most difficult part of my job is actually not the job, I've worked for the company for seven years, and have recently experienced some poor leaders.  It is most difficult for me to feel appreciated, respected, and capable because of our leadership.  In the past I have had some wonderful supervisors and manangers, and the most enjoyable part about my job is helping individuals who actually have the drive and capability to be developed into new leaders."
good,You are a manager that is over worked because you have a staff that cares less. So you end up doing all the work....
good,"When I worked in the bakery or the Starbucks in the store, I always had fun, because my co-workers where always laughing and making work an enjoyable place. "
good,You can expect to make minimum wage starting out and to maybe make a $.10 raise per year. This is one of the most difficult places of employment to receive recognition or possibility for advancement. 
good,Wished for more understanding supervisors overall. Hours were OK--and the other employees were a friendly group.
good,"Very underpaid, over worked. management very unorganized "
good,"Ona typical day at work I would take my seat by the phone and answer all calls to the store. I will transfer each call to corresponding departments or take messages. I've learned how to handle ,ultiple telephone lines. I got a long fine with all my co-workers."
good,"Go clock in. Get PDA. Then clean out dairy, frozen, meat, and produce rooms. Get all batches. Then take ALL items the freezer put on shelves, then backstock ALL items that did not fit. After that, take ALL items from the dairy cooler, and do the same thing. Next, do the same thing for the meat and produce coolers. Then go home. "
good,I learned a lot about how to handle customer complaints and how to rely on myself to make smart beneficial decisions for both the customer and store. I learned how to work with different people. Management pays little attention to things happening st the service desk (the area I worked). I enjoyed working with my co workers and did a good job of designating responsibilities among each other that we did especially well or enjoyed doing best. The hardest part of my job was not getting recognition for the hard work I put forth. The most enjoyable was working with and meeting new people every day.
good,"A typical day for me starts at 4 am.  I help set up two areas, and then I begin to work the flats in my area.  I sometimes get between 2 to 6 flats a day depending on the truck size.  On the flats I separate shelf items for 20 rows in the infant and baby section.  I have learned to be better at organizing so I can quickly open boxes and place items neatly and proficiently on each row without going backwards to revisit the same row. I sometimes have a hard time with management because of their lack of management skills and respect.  They are mostly young recruits right out of college with no basic skills in management.  My co-workers and I have learned to be a team and we help each other out.  The hardest part about the job is sometimes the attitudes one has to deal with in such a diverse environment,  but if one takes time to communicate, it can be worked out.  Also not being scheduled 40 hours in a week.  Sometimes its 16 hours I am scheduled in a week and I search and beg for extra shifts and the low pay.   The most enjoyable part I think is going in early before the store opens concentrating on my part as a team player and getting off early so I have the rest of the day to get my personal things done."
good,it was my first job and i was hired as seasonal. training only lasted a week and the rest i had to learn on the fly. It was fun for awhile then the management changed and the aim of the store changed and things got worse. being my first job I learned what working daily felt like so i appreciate the learning experience 
good,"A typical day is spent checking out and interacting with guests, selling Red Cards, and getting funds ready for the next day. I have great co-workers, but management seems to be getting out of touch with what keeps the employees happy lately. I really enjoy talking with the guests and helping them out in any way possible."
good,"hours were horrible to have any social or home life, expectations were seemed to always grow but pay never climbed with them, co-workers only out for them selfs"
good,"If lacking in ""people"" skills, avoid this line of work. Everyday involves customer interaction and patience in countless questions and concerns, sometimes direct comments if customer is not pleased. But it is the typical retail experience."
good,"Target is no better than Wal-Mart. Only few differences is the pay is less and management smiles more. Pushing its grunt workers to its last drop of energy. expecting someone to finish their department even down to the last 30 minutes till the end of shift. Providing excellent customer service is first priority but at the cost of losing progress in the department, which leaves you listening to LOD (leader on duty) to mock your work and explain to you your job which you already know as if your a child. Currently still there I've come to the point of having to ask others for help without an LOD noticing. In return doing whatever need be as my show of thanks. Some of our customers are a joy to help and I go above and beyond to help them. The small joy I receive is seeing friends with the same problems standing side by side talking of amusing stories outside the walls. All I've learned from retail is that as Americans we want so much (LODs) yet never wanting to give close back in return (lower employees)"
good,To much management going on. To many team leads when I worked there.
good,Target employees are very rude and disrespectful; the managers have no respect for the employees that are under them. This is a place I enjoyed working at until I started to be disrespected and talked down upon. This store has a lack of working equipment and other things.
good,Make sure that the customers have a good experince.
good,"Not a bad job, work hard, save your pennies and stay in school."
good,Really enjoyed the type of work I was doing.Enjoyed working with different people.Learned alot about the retail bussiness.Loved the hustle and bustle of the holidays.Hardest part of the job was bowling out. All aspects of the job were enjoyable.
good,I was given hours that I had not otherwise stated I was available for. Because the manager was never around I was always the one doing his duties and then some. The pros of this job is the commission when you can get it.
good,"Bright fluorescent lighting, difficult/tardy employees, rude customers, and draining hours with short breaks near the end of almost every shift."
good,"Management at Target is not up to part, everybody is always looking out for themselves and not other. As a big company we all should always have each others back at all times either from right or wrong. A typical day at target is okay. Sometimes it can be hard at work when their is no one their to help you when in time of need."
good,the management is awful regardless i did work with a lot of great people there however if you are looking for them to be flexible with schedules and other things you wont get it
good,"I've been working here for 10 years and have seen a lot of changes. I've learned a lot about customer service, merchandising, and leadership."
good,Its retail... what can I say?! Plus they lead me on to believe I was on the verge of advancement... for 6 months.
good,I worked in the backroom before the store opened. It was alright.
good,"Working for this company was indeed a privlidge because they paid more than my previous employer. Being a college student when I worked there, I felt very disconnected from the goals that management was desperate to accomplish. I was extremely bored with the tasks I was forced to do. At times, management would ask employeees to accomplish goals that were essentially impossible, however. The sales goals they would try to accomplish were really dependent upon how many people came in the store on a particular day. This was probably the most frustrating part of the job. Also, management was a little fake; they would pretend to be ok with mistakes you may make. but they're never forgotten."
good,You have great benefits but they are changing this year taking most of the great out of the benefits and giving us basics but before this year it was great. Co-workers are the biggest part of your family not Management your co-workers if they are all on the same page makes life at work great. The hardest part of the job is Management they have structured it so many times and their hiring people with no experience in retail and some of them have never had a job. As supervisors and experienced people in our field we have to train upper management to do their job and they take the credit for our success of the store. Its very frustrating and it demoralizes you and the team that has worked so hard daily. Experience is not valued and without a degree you are going no where and even with a degree if you are already a supervisor with in the job already they will hire outside before moving people with in.
good,"Although this job is outside of my trade, it was enjoyable. For the most part, the management staff was pleasant and easy to talk to. The schedule was constantly changing, which at that time, was fine with me. However, when my classes resumed they admittedly had an issue with my not working Friday nights or weekends."
good,"I have worked with this company for almost 15 years. I got a college degree while working with this company. I have looked into and have seen no possibility with the company to move up in position. The manual labor is not hard, but I am looking for something where I use my mind more than my body and have a job that fits my degree and abilities better. I want a feeling that the work I do means something. I strive to do a good job and make progress in whatever I do. I do the best I can at being efficient and hard working. I currently do not feel any appreciation for what I do from the company I currently work for."
good,"A typical day at work, is great. I stock the floor help guest look for what they need. I have learned that retail inside and out. My co-workers are very nice people that comes form many backgrounds. The hardest part of the job is trying to compelet a 40hr work load with only 28hrs, the most enjoyable party of the job is making shoppers happy."
good,I have worked there twice same store. I feel like I am being taking advantage of.
good,The typical day started around 6:30am. I really enjoyed seeing the store come together from the back of the truck to the front of the store.
good,"As customer service manager, I scheduled cashiers, service desk, operators and cart attendants. I made sure all of these employees were trained. All transactions were my responsilbility. Overs/shorts were researched by me. I had a budget for NSF checks, cash shortages, chargebacks, and supplies. I also had to answer for excessive turnover. The hardest parts of my job were having small children and the ""55 hour"" schedule meant nothing. If there was a tour we were required to stay all night after working all day. We would then go home and take a shower so we would be ""fresh"" for the visitors. These tours would often coincide with my scheduled day off. The other problem with tours was the hourly personnel were kept all night as well and would hit 40 hours before the weekend. No hourly personnel were allowed overtime which created a shortage of helpon the weekend creating another overnight shift for the salaried manager on Friday and Saturday nights."
good,"The first time I worked for this company I loved it, the pay wasn't great, but I loved the people and the enivornment. The second time I worked there I didn't feel like the managment staff were doing their jobs,and weren't organized."
good,"Consists of meeting daily goals and customer service, most days were without any input from management. The job tends to become very familiar after being there for a while, nothing really comes as a surprise. The important thing is becoming very good at what you do and co-workers were always kind, polite, and fun to work with. The hardest thing about working there is being held responsible for things outside of your control, the majority of stress in this job comes from unattainable goals stemming from upper level management. Even though commission is not given, you are expected to make an ever increasing number of sales or your job security is at risk. Located throughout the store are call boxes to call an employee over to help a customer, but employees will get an infraction allowing one of these to go off even if you're currently helping another customer. Overall it really depends on the store one works. I've heard of people who love their job, and other times it can a place where you're job is on the line every day working to the point of exhaustion is what it takes to keep it."
good,"The Target culture is, well, cultish. The company has its own language, mottos and so forth. If you walk around using all this you are OK. If not, you are constantly corrected."
good,they are giving opportunities to all the people who wants to learn more like me
good,"The managment expects more work for less hours. Not worth the pay, depending on position and the raises are only a percentage of what you make. The only enjoyable part of the job is when I leave for the day."
good,Nice staff except management is very picky. Hate the uniform though. even if you have a red shirt on you cant have a different colored sweat shirt.
good,Target is a good place to work. they are all about team building and fast fun and friendly environments. Typical work day involves greeting guests and helping out as much as you can. I
good,"no loyalty, takes forever to promote. managers are not the greatest in the world."
good,"A typical Day at work was unload the truck,break,push merchandise, back stock etc. I learned how to correctly stock items. Management were acceptable. My co workers were excellent when it came to team work. The hardest part of that job was having to unload 2 trucks daily. the most enjoyable part was getting of or work in the morning."
good,"Not enough hours, no job advancement and lack of motivation among the employees, most are just there for a paycheck."
good,The most enjoyable part of working is interacting with my co-workers and getting the job done.
good,not enough males in my opinion work there. To much management and a lot of responsibility. co-workers were ok. I think that the toughest part of the job was getting home at night.
good,some managers would force unsafe work procedures against company and state code without being punished. but otherwise a fun but tiring job cleaning and restocking all inventory.
good,"Target started out great i got lots of hours but then quickly turned into a bad experience the boss man would text in front of everyone cut our breaks short, wont spend the 50$ a night target gives them for the overnight team for food and constantly yells at us for not getting our job done we only get 4 hours a night to do our job which most of the time is not enough"
good,"While my co-workers were overall nice, the whole store was filled with laziness. My first day on the job I was ""trained"" in how to look like I was working while really slacking off. There was no direct supervisor system, so I would frequently have 2 or more managers telling me what to do, with none of them communicating between themselves."
good,"Work days differs from day to day. Some days are smooth sailing and some days are chaotic. Working for this company I learned that you must take care of yourself first and documentation is your best-friend. Management are so disposable when working for this company. The employees said that many don't last, and management is a revolving door with the company. The management class I started in was 20. By the time I there were only 3 left in a two year period. The employees are fantastic. The management team depending on the store's location was great to really poor. The management turnover and the lack of job security as a member of management was hard to deal with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the employees and hosting monthly fun activities for them to appreciate their job."
good,"At Target the most important thing is our guests. Everything that i do on a daily basis is geared toward making their shopping experience more enjoyable. I help guests find things that they are looking for. I keep the products full on the shelves and i keep the store looking clean and well-kept. I have learned how to be patient and understanding when it comes to unhappy guests. I have learned how to order products, like how much to order and when to order it. I have always been an efficient person, but working at Target has taken that skill to a whole new level. The hardest part of the job for me is seeing an unsatisfied guest, it really makes me upset and work that much harder. The most enjoyable part is making a guest's day and teaming up with my co-workers to accomlish tasks."
good,"The job wasfor remodeling the store for target, a little hetic, unorganized and 3rd shift hourswas rough."
good,"At Target, you're not treated equally and that's a big problem in my book. I don't get recognized for the hard work I do, I've realized I will never move up in the company, and they don't pay you what you deserve."
good,A Great retail environment doesnt pay much but u get a full insight to the world of guest services and cash handling
good,Your day is only about 4 hrs and one or two days a week. Not a job that you make a living alone. But there is a positive culture.
good,I loved working on the sales floor. I enjoyed helping our guest to what they need in our store.
good,"Arrive at work 4am then I clock in. I gather a few shopping carts and place them in the apperal department. Then I go to loading dock and help unload the boxes and onto the flatbeds. Transport the flatbeds that has apperal boxes stack on to the right department. My team and I unpack the boxes and then start sorting out the clothing by size, brand name sleep wear, girls, boys, men, and women sections. We then take a rack of clothes and work that section of clothing. The last thing we do is the accessories before we start putting the racks and shopping cart back where they belong. I have learn that a lot of work goes into making a great shopping experience for the customers. The management always pushed us to do our best as a team player. The hardest part about my job was getting up at 3am when I having late nights with my son. What I enjoyed was meeting new people and helping customers."
good,"Its a normal retail store job, gets crazy around the holidays but can fun wuth the right co-workers."
good,i enjoyed working with my co-workers. everyone was very friendly and always helpfull
good,"My day typical at target starts with clocking in greeting co-workers and starting work right away. I work with guests and there concerns, or try to work out a solution before asking for managers input. I then have to relieve a fellow co-worker and initially take my break afterwards. I work until my lunch break is reached. I take lunch and get back to work. I work the rest of the day until my shift is over. I clock out and go home to start the process over again."
good,"Working at target wasn't bad, The managers were cool to work with, and got along preety good with my co-workers. Productivity was good and learnt a lot working with and being part of a team. The negatives about working there were, Their were'nt any benifits, and they would hire new people and cut your hours."
good,"Don't Care about their employees, don't give cost of living adjustments. would rather hire more people rather than giving curent employees hours they should get."
good,"I never knew when I would go into work, or when I would leave. And I was not informed when I was fired until that day. When they told me I shouldn't have shown up. Thank you Target."
good,Working at target there was more bad then good. They were unable to keep stable number of team members and very difficult in terms of scheduling.
good,One thing I can say about Target is they focus on team work and getting things done as a team. Other than that they short people on their hours and at times when they do have you working alone put unrealistic goals upon a person.
good,Target use to be fast fun and friendly but not now once new management came in everyone is unhappy.
good,"The employees they hire for you to work with are almost always amazing; your coworkers will feel like family and that’s great. However, the management at this location is aweful. Never on the same page with each other even and have been put down by management many times including being called a failure and a loser by the manager in charge for missing a day when my child was sick on a very busy day."
good,"Management is passive aggressive and clique-ish. You have to fend off managements' projections. They're wishy-washy and don't value employee happiness. There's an empathy problem as well and they do not care about their workers. Too many coworkers I know have had breakdowns on the floor. They also randomly drop your hours to a degrading amount. It doesn't matter if you're good at your job, if you're naturally a bit shy they will punish you for it by not scheduling you that much. They basically push you to quit or find a second job. HR cannot be trusted. They will tell other team members what you've told them and not take your claims seriously."
good,Management will hold you to a higher standard even though you're doing mostly positive things at work. They want everybody to follow orders like we were some pointless dummies. Other than that the place and customers were a positive and great environment. I enjoyed working with my co-worker; they were the best.
good,"A typical work day for me was to clear the truck line (grocery department of course) stocking shelves by rotating merchandise by date, any damaged merchandise would be donated, making bales when needed and labeling shelves."
good,"Leaders will give you too much to do in not enough time and then get mad if its not exactly how they want. Deceptive interview as well. You go into your first day thinking you're gonna have freedom to be able to play around with the clothing in your zone and the mannequins, but in reality, every last shirt has an exact spot it needs to go in and you must follow the visual merchandising guide."
good,"Target needs to be realistic in the time and money they give you to work. Just because you know everything doesn't mean you will get the promotion. If you want to work here, please understand you will work hard for less pay."
good,The amount of work we do in the day and get paid very little. I love the company of Target with a passion but to be paid very little very doing a lot of work is terrible. They expect so much but don’t give us the tools to do our job
good,Some of the HR department are unfair. All in all ok place to work. Don't count on a lasting job. Don't let them overwork you and plan to be laid off when the work slows down.
good,"If you're looking for a paycheck, a few hours of work a week and a company that doesn't particularly care if you're there or not, this is a great place to work! "
good,Target is a decent place to work. they offer employee discounts and flexible hours. The team members are helpful and friendly. Management is nice and always willing to help.
good,The people under management are great. The management team only look out for themselves. They need to take a class in human resources to really appreciate their team.
good,"At Target, maintaining a healthy relation with both your team members and leaders is quite important to get work done. Customer service is the number one priority however the somewhat lack of work members was a bit surprising. Some workers are kept constantly busy with mundane or repetitive tasks. Some workers have been able to be promoted by transferring stores. Management was adequate with a full team meeting at least every 1-2 days. Somewhat physically draining with getting around the store for a few hours straight. Lunch break was roughly 1-1.5 hours depending on your shift. You get to meet a variety of people, due to customer service, which comes with both benefits and challenges. It was enjoyable to assist customers and create some positive work relations."
good,"Management is about favoritism and “yes” people. The work is fun and absolutely has no end, but customers are very entertaining. Most TL’s are awesome, but upper management likes to play games with peoples money and livelihood."
good,Most of my coworkers were great but this is not a place were you can move up. I was only there a year and got just a 4 cent raise they would schedule me 2 weeks of full time hours then cut me back down so I don't get benefits and only 1 person got promoted to a management job. If we had a management position they hired from outside source. People that had been there for 20+ years were barley making more then minimum wage
good,What I learned while working at target was that it takes a lot of effort and dedication  to work for a big corporate company and they have a lot of guidelines and boundaries you have to follow and if you don’t you can’t keep your job so I learn how to manage my time with my work
good,"The company itself is restructuring,  most employees are not offered benefits as total hours keep them from qualifying for them. Enjoyed my first 2 years there but had to leave due to all the changes."
good,"Target was my family for 15 years☺ I started as a cashier and then moved to the salesfloor. I was not fond of the open/close shifts, so I was offered a position on the presentation team.  I  just loved my job! I eventually took over the signing in addition....loved this too! I felt appreciated and valued for many years.  It was fun while it lasted!"
good,There is always something to do to stay busy during the shift. There has never been a moment where I found myself bored. Management I feel can be improved upon. Some team leads want task completed a certain way that conflicts with another team lead's priority.
good,Target recently increased its minimum wage to $13 an hour and plans an increase to $15 but this increase in wages has led to an extremely stressful work environment where employees are required to do twice the amount of work then what they used to under the standard minimum wage.
good,"The job itself is a learning curve. Some of the day to day tasks takes time to become efficient at, however, once you have a handle on it, the job becomes easier. The job does become really annoying when dealing with guests, but it is manageable."
good,"Some of the managers are excellent at what they do. A busy day has you performing two job descriptions at once, your position and cashier, due to scheduling. Coworkers are excellent people. Some locations are not the best but it works."
good,"The management is poor. Corporate does not really understand what goes on in the day to day operations but they make suggestions and edits to your staff and schedule as if they do. However , if have management experience in retail this is nothing you are going to be surprised about."
good,"There are many times I feel unsupported. Expectations change and people are treated as if they are replaceable. Big promises are made to new hires, but the company's limited payroll always wins over people's performance or what the business needs."
good,"Store managers left to own devices do questionable business  practices.  Ie changing cardboard bale size.  To create illusion of more bales.  Management throwing merchandise around, putting  door knob through wall."
good,"Target is an overrated company by far. Target is only good for part time. The hours are flexible sometimes. But honestly, you do a lot of work and don't get paid enough for the amount of work that you do so yeah like I said Target is overrated!"
good,"While this job was fun, management chose seniority for promotions rather than seeking out and considering those who have the skills and passion to move up and do well. "
good,"For the most part working in fulfillment is easy, just tiring. Everyone is normally willing to help if you can't find something or don't understand. Downside they don't keep most seasonal workers even though they tell you that they do."
good,target use to be a great place to work at till the modification came along and we get paid more money . now we are all stressed out and the hours they give us are not enough to get everything finished they want us to do.
good,"This company lacks communication between the managers and employees its a trickle down effect, benefits arent that great and ""training""  is just chucking you into it"
good,"If you are looking for full time , you will not find it at Target, I would recommend working for Target during holiday seasons only..Its a fast paced time and helps the day go by."
good,Unload a truck. Restock electronics section. Deal with customers.Restock the electronics lock up in the warehouse and bale recycled cardboars to send out.
good,Target is a good company to work for for extra cash but not somewhere to feel like you belong. They hurdle in as many people as they can (especially during the holidays) just to get the job done. You are not important or recognized unless you're killing yourself to complete a task... But I guess that's retail!
good,"Just about all of the people I worked with, coworkers and some managers were great on a social level. Some good Priority 1 Stockers. But beware if you work in the backroom. It was very unorganized, poor communication between Mangers to employees was a real problem, will have to deal with rude mean spirited leads out of nowhere in the store a lot of the time. They were going thru a lot of changes at this particular location, having to deal with corporate to come and in and correct problems that stemmed from the backroom. Which changed the energy, attitude, and atmosphere of the store as far as the backroom was concerned.... I have to say negatively."
good,"I love working in human resources, and the team members I work with are amazing.  The issue is that the upper leadership ( Store Director and District Director) are out of touch with people."
good,"I've been working for Target for about 3 months now. "
good,"Good pay for management, upper management is sneaky and not looking to help base-level management . Learned multiple aspects of Target and Starbucks. Short-staffed at Starbucks almost on a weekly basis."
good,Job is okay. Management not so good they expect to much out of you in a short amount of time. They every flexible with your schedule if you have school
good,The only thing that was bad about the job is i only worked 3 days a week and 4 hours a day. Other than that the people were great. And always supportive. I learned cashier. And it was always busy.i like moving slow or fast paced
good,"Been working full time hour for 12 years but company is not letting employees work full time hours anymore.    I need  full time job with benefits "
good,"Not good pay, target does not pay well   The work was ok  a day at target went fast, I was stocking and cashiering when needed  I also worked in the fitting room answering phones and giving out numbers for items in the fitting room"
good,When hired you are trained for a specific area and you do not normally get to assist your fellow employees in their areas unless your area can spare you and the other area is in drastic need of help. The breaks allotted for shifts are shorter than those given by competitors.
good,You are expected to provide guest service while sorting and stocking what comes off the truck and gather returned merchandise to put back on the floor. Hours vary depending on the season. Where you work in the store is dependent on what is needed. Supplies to do your job effectively can be hard to find. Some of the management team talks at you and not to you when giving directions and can be rude in front of other associates.
good,"Corporate has changed all position mandatory working hours which give no regard to any type of a personal life / family life. After being extremely happy with Target for over 6 years, and having one of the highest scored annual reviews and an impeccable attendance record with the location, Corporate raised minimum pay to the same amount current, dedicated, fully trained employees were making leaving experienced people making the same amount as a day one, untrained person was making. Being a trainer, I was training people who were making the same salary as I was. Over half of the long term team members left within a year. It was a ""slap in the face"" for all the years of dedication. Heartbreaking - - I loved my job along with the majority of my fellow workers, until the powers that be decided to destroy the moral of the people who honestly cared about the company."
good,My experience at Target was more of a independent working environment. Other than working together as a group. I was a cashier and that's all I did. But I really enjoyed the guest we had come in it was like a love atmosphere.
good,"When I got into work, most days I had no idea what I would be doing until I found a team lead. I dreaded going into work to clean areas I had cleaned the day before. Most of the team leads were nice, but I didn't trust a couple of them to actually know what they were doing. The worst part was doing the same thing every day and none of it ever changed."
good,Target was a great stepping stone job. It is a good place to gain some skills and work experience while still in school. It is very difficult to get and maintain 40 hours if you want/need a full-time job. More of a part-time job.
good,Hourly pay is fair for what you do. But don’t expect more than 20 hours a week in your department unless you are willing to pick up shifts throughout the store.
good,Managerial staff wasn't too understanding about needing to meet 30+ hours a week. Only about 25 hours were given to any employee. Didn't seem to understand about the scheduling either as it was not consistent. Other employees were nice but we all had the same concern about hours.
good,"Target is great about letting its employees have expression in their personal appearance and supporting their LGBT employees."
good,"Target is better than most retail companies, but it's not something you can sustain yourself on. If I had to work retail again, I'd probably choose Target, although they do sometimes have issues with hours and wages been correct in the paycheck. The management is decent."
good,"I typically work at the customer service desk. Target is a great place to work if you’re a free loader and want an easy job where you make decent money and take zero pride in your work. However, if you tend to take initiative, take pride in your work, care about others or have any self respect, then you will be taken advantage of very badly. They expect everyone to “work equally” but what ends up happening is a small few are overworked and everyone else is a free loader.  Management is a joke and don’t really care about anyone else."
good,Working with Target helped me continue to grow my experience in the field of criminal justice from the retail side. I was able to learn and grow my skill in the loss prevention field.
good,"The only real complaint is the fact that at any one point in time there are three to five managers on the floor that all want to have a say in what you do and how you do it, and none of them communicate with each other."
good,"Originally it was ""sold"" as ""personal shopping for guests"" when in reality you are mostly running around and micromanaged so you are unable to get your job completed effectively. This may just be my management but you will be doing more than most anyone in the store and be criticized the most when your tasks aren't done to completion and you are understaffed for 75% of the year, then over staffed the other 25%. Hours fluctuate and even though you make roughly $13 an hour, many times your averaging at about 17 hrs a week. I only wanted 25  hrs a week and I don't hit that usually."
good,"it is a very good job, you work at your own pace just as long as you get your tasks done but the management does not know what they’re doing but overall they need a better management team"
good,"Most of management were kind."
good,"No benefits, managers from pther departments bark orders at you. They cater to their employees lunch for holidays though. The training was bare minimum"
good,I found myself working schedules that i clearly indicated from the beginning that i could not work. Days where i was sick they still expected me to come in. Bosses will boss around while doing nothing themselves. Lack of coverage.
good,"No work life balance. Good benefits, long hours. 50+ hours a week. "
good,"I would be lying if I said I didn't gain anything working for Target. I gained lots of experience, connections, and knowledge. It's a great place to get your foot in the door and build some work experience for yourself. The schedule was very flexible, which I liked. But it's very stressful, and gets worse the longer you're there. I've come to dread most days there, just because I have no idea what disaster awaits me. Not to say it's always awful, but staying here for over a year has taken a toll on me"
good,"They ask for your availability so they can schedule for as many hours as they can, and the schedule you outside of your availability every week. You can talk to your managers, but they don't handle scheduling, so you have to hunt down the HR department, and then tell them. You also have to make sure they actually change your schedule, otherwise they'll call you when you were supposedly scheduled even though it is outside of your availability and you even hunted them down and asked them to fix it the week before, and then they'll 0enalize you for not giving them notice that you can't be there."
good,"It paid enough but store management team kept either quitting, changing, getting fired so overall working there was really unorganized and unprofessional"
good,Have to have open availability. Work days were almost the same all week. However open availability was expected as schedule would change without much warning. A part time job with low hours and little options for getting a second job. Not very accommodating.
good,"Great company inside the store... leaders outside the store (District and above) are inept.  If you want to fit in with the upper management you will need to be willing to do as your told, do not think critically or logically, and be a female or minority preferably under 30."
good,Target is probably a good job for students mostly or recent graduates that need a job experience and to learn to work hard but definitely not a good job to survive in this economy.
good,A good place to get into the mind set of having a job if its your first time. No real future for the long run in terms of moving up the ladder. Good for getting quality customer service experience. Would not recommend if you want to be able to live in California off of its pay/benefits or be able to support yourself through college.
good,"I worked at T-0090 for a decade. Initially it was a fun place to work. Over the years the fun decreased and the stress increased. Since the entry level pay has increased to 15.00/hour, the job expection has become ridiculous. They want the team to do work of 5 people. As a style team member you will have to complete: push freight from truck, brand (organize) department, price change, set visual merchandising, cashier, customer service, clean the fitting rooms, pick online orders, know sales goals. All thses tasks are completed daily! Target has gone crazy! But if you are a favorite then it may not seem so bad. "
good,"This is a good company to look into if you are in school, or needing some extra work. But I would not recommend it to someone looking for a serious career. The management is hard to work with, and they lack the loyalty to long term employees."
good,"I would say my target experience was a little below average. It was my first job while in High School and while I loved the interviewing process and how fast the job offer happened, the actual day of training was quite a let down. I didn’t feel it was adequate enough and therefor the expectations of management afterwards became increasingly more difficult because I never felt properly trained. I also had some unprofessional coworkers that made my experience even harder."
good,Something i learned while working at target was I'm a very quick learner. I can work under pressure with no complaints. The culture there was fast pace but easy to keep up with. For the most part my coworkers were nice and fun to work with.
good,"typical day at work, you come in and clean up the mess closing crew didn't finish or do (zone and area detail fix). Then do your Pulls for that area then work on truck freight. the rest of the day you will sales planners or price change or something dealing with the area. Heavy on time management. wants everything done 3-4 hours before shift ends."
