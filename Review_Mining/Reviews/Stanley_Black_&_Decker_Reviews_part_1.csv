rating,review
bad,"Started unloading. Worked my way to reach operator doing putaways and even running the stretch, but they don’t really care about entry level associates. It’s just a transactional relationship to management. Entirely impersonal and unrealistic work relationships and production standards. You’re just a  dollar sign here. Overtime is currently being reduced, and the turnover rate is atrocious here. They think quarterly prizes and tacos make up for the lack of involvement by management , but refuse to reward the associates financially."
bad,Horrible about hours worked vs hours paid. 1 hour per day is romoved from paycheck for commuting time even though you are dispatched from your home to travel to jobs in a company vehicle and manditory conference calls you don't get paid for.
bad,HR in Southington location was terrible.  They were awful.  Unprofessional.  Did not follow proper procedures.  I would never advise anyone to work there.
bad,"No advancement. Managers care nothing about people. Horrible leadership, all about the company. Same job for 5 years, I'm stuck. Have tried to advance, they deny me."
bad,Worse place to work for and I didn’t like it at all. They treat you like your nothing and boss you around all day. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
bad,The person who has been brought up on HR charges for wrongful termination and other HR atrocities has just been named President of the company... run away as fast as you can
bad,Poor management dirty messy non climate controlled and they don't even open the doors. They have been open less than a year and already 7 recordable injuries!
bad,Worst company to work for. Purely target oriented and do not respect employees. Running on old legacy systems and do not invest in human or system capital.
bad,"This job is basically modern day slavery with little pay. They make you constantly built their products and WONT give you benefits until like 6months of working there. So if you develop something like carpel tunnel from this repetitive heavy lyfting, you’re out of luck. You just damaged your hands and they’ll get another slave to come in and do your job. Mean while you’re fired and can’t work anywhere else because your hands have gone out. I wouldn’t work here if you’re educated and can get another job somewhere else."
bad,"They do not have an employee retention policy."
bad,This place sucks I’ve been working there for about almost 2 years and every change they make just make the job more stressful and they are not paying what they say they gone pay you
bad,Favoritism is their policy.  No raises.  The benefits are great.  No room to grow.  Managers use you for their benefits literally.   Rumors and gossip
bad,"This is a factory job of the worst kind. I worked 6 days a week overnight, get off Saturday morning and go back Sunday night so you never actually had a day off. We were only schedule to work 7 hours a day so they got away with only giving us 2 ten minute breaks."
bad,You could bust butt all day right besiDE people that would barely move and it wouldn't be noticed. Most the supervisors are high and are useless when comes to help because they've never worked a day on the line.
bad,"Empresa muito mau organizada, sem gestão de pessoas, focada apenas em metas, onde fica impossível conciliar com a vida pessoal, se você saí no seu horário é mau visto, pessoas trabalham em média 12 horas por dia, gestão despreparada e agressiva quanto a metas, salário abaixo do mercado. Infelizmente não focam em resolver os problemas operacionais, o que acaba denigrindo a imagem perante aos clientes."
bad,If you want to work like a slave and always have to watch your back constantly especially if your new then go there. The bosses are nice at first but they only like you if your not sucking up to them.
bad,The management in customer services was unreal . There current management team needs to treat there all reps with more respectful and valuable. They are not fit for there positions and cannot handle there own work load with ease and grace. There are a pure cry for help in more ways than one.
bad,Management does not speak to you in a honest matter and they are not allowing certain race of people to become hired directly by the company. Instead they keep you temporary so that they can fire you at will.
bad,"Definitely the worst factory setting I have ever been in, constantly being harassed, managers don't care about you or the issues you have. Doesn't deserve 1 star, but that's the least it would let me give."
bad,"They demand you work the ""optional"" overtime and punish any who take off, even if it's for a legitimate claim such as a doctors appointment or anything like that. Management refuses to manage employee issues and will side with whomever puts up the biggest fuss. Best advice working here would be to keep your head down, don't interact with others and keep looking for a new job."
bad,"Unless you want to be degraded and like hearing constant cussing, given no training and thrown under the bus DO NOT DO IT!!! Worse place I have ever worked in my entire life!!!"
bad,Did not like the job. Everything was unorganized. No professional leadership. Management did not interact with employees. They only gave 20 minute lunch break and two 5 minute breaks
bad,the company is driven by numbers and profit. benefits are average. work life home balance is average. good opportunities for entry level graduates with degrees.
bad,atuando como estagiário e posteriormente analista - a experiencia de maneira geral foi positiva - chefia comprometida - pouca oportunidade de crescimento.
bad,"bad managment, didnt work with you with family matters, didnt concider how people felt,  very racial, tried separating teams by race, overall a very bad company to work for"
bad,this is the worst company of the world for workers specially for Diploma or B-tech engineer.......wast of time if try this company...be careful........the review or advertisement is very very good but never try this company for your future...i have bad experience with this company.
bad,"Place is full of dust, very noisy and has very little environmental controls."
bad,they where unprofessional with numbers they have you working at a fast paste they don't care for the reason why all they care about is numbers and company making money. they only keep people there they want.
bad,I had to check the grainder wheel and stock them in a box to be shipped off and it was a hot and cold work place to work at but the end up closing down the compant
bad,The company abused the workers made them work So many dame hours for nothing we never had a life work 12hour shift and still got great as nothing in there...
bad,The company was a good company when i started but then ended up being all business and not compensation or acknowledgement for the employees after a few years.
bad,"This place is like a slave ship no lie. They work you like you are a dog, its hot inside, when you ask to be moved they won’t move you. Go somewhere else to work."
bad,"i did not like it there and it was hot , humid, miserable , low pay , back stabbing employees , under payed , bad insurance , short hours just barely made bills."
bad,The management is very poor at Stanley in concord! They show allot of favoritism to the Spanish and African ppl for some reason...  I did revive production pay but since they changed their system it was very hard if not impossible to hit the production mark! I had worked here for almost a year and usually made production in every location I was in! They expect ppl to come in and work so hard and you only receive $9.25 a hour if you are unable to make production. I wouldn't want anyone I know working at Stanley! And to top it off you wouldn't be able to move up in this company for years!!! You don't receive any paid time off or sick days until you have worked for them for a whole year! I won't ever work for Stanley again.... they definently lost a good worker!!!!!!!
bad,"Good temporary job. They treat you great to get you in, then ignore you if you are not pne pf their suck ups. Not an oprn door company. If you are not first shift you are a npbody"
bad,Training was not adequate.  You were put on a job and expected to know what to do from the start.  If you made a mistake that you didn't know any better you were reprimanded.  Some workers treated better than others/Descrimination
bad,"This company lacks diversity, and they don't favor different voices. If you come from a background of other races, please think twice before joining. Specifically, avoid Global IT department at all cost, the management and HR are the worst I ever dealt with. Young talented people would not stay."
bad,"They play you on your production, come to you at the last minute telling you, you have to work on Saturday. They give 2nd shift all the work, 1st and 3rd got it made."
bad,"Turn rate for company is extremely high, it's stressful and overall not worth the time. Couple supervisors were helpful but upper management wasn't and quantity came before quality."
bad,Asi nejhorší firma kde pracovat - jakou si umím představit. Alespoň ta v ústí nad labem
bad,"The staff there are above evil, they will be out to get you for no reason, they tamper with your machine, look down their noses at you and treat you like dirt on a shoe. Break times are a joke, you have to run to canteen and back, no lockers, high sky high prices and dirty. Avoid regardless of job, contract or position."
bad,"Stay away. This place is all about politics and doesn't value good people. "
bad,"Messed around as agency staff. Put on same shift each week then drop night shift onto you. start times vary from 1430 to 0630 and 2230. No proper training, dirty, smelly and you have to shout to talk to anyone. Arrogant staff especially chisels dept. Supervision are up their own backsides."
bad,"Nast place to work. Most workers stick their noses up at you because they may have worked there 70 years. Workers take the p--iss on breaks and interfere with machinery so you cannot do your job."
bad,"They under pay you for all the work that you do . management have nasty attitude just a horrible place to work. You can't talk just work which is very boring , no music nothing ... They want robots ,you might get hired on but nine times out of ten you won't ."
bad,"mala jefatura y mal salario tanto como horarios y paga,mal hambiente laboral y sucursales asignadas a una hora de mi vivienda"
bad,"Consistently excellent work and perfect attendance, refusal to hire after many months of working there."
bad,Horrible place to work they have no respect for employees or their families .. All they care about is getting the numbers and will change your hours as they see fit with no heads up.. Employees there 10 years make as much as a temp starting out... They don't give you enough people to get the job done and are to stupid to realize why people are tripping over themselves to try and meet the numbers ..the little help we do get are from temps who come in high and operate machinery .. AND STILL MAKE MORW THAN 10 year vets!!!  Everyone there is trying to get out.. I urge do not waste your time with this dead end job .  This is the Indianapolis plant .
bad,Personally insulted on a regular basis by lead technician who created a horrible work environment. The poorest exhibition of professionalism I've ever experienced.
bad,printing or packing saw blades to be shipped to customers. I learned how to mix ink and use a printing machine and how to set it up. I also learned how to set up and run a packing machine. Management at black and decker was unlike any management I've ever worked for. Hardest part o the job was not having the product to do your job effectively. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.
bad,"-non respect des employés"
bad,Management has no idea what they are doing. People are moved shifts and departments all of the time with no regard for their personal life. Shift times and days change from week to week.
bad,"out of business"
bad,"Pays decent but not a good company to work for. The work process is ok but the management and the way things are run there don't satisfy me, I just go about my business and get my paycheck."
bad,SBD IT India has a poor work culture mostly due to the onshore managers. There has been no growth for the past 5 years. They have been downsizing offshore resources each time they had to reduce costs
bad,They closed location in Santa Ana. New monitoring center is in WA. They had our center overworked and under paid. Their Minnesota location gets paid more for the same work.
bad,Disappointed couldn't get to see grandchildren much or take care of things around the house. The overtime notice for Saturdays wouldnt find out until end of day on thursdays.
bad,"A conduta dos gestores é mais proxima dos interesses pessoais, como beneficiar, amigos, namorados, noivos etc, do que valorizar os profissionais de talento que existem dentro da Organização."
bad,"O ambiente é tóxico e o RH não faz nada para melhorar, a reclamação sobre desmotivação entre os funcionários é constante. Se eu recomendo a empresa? De jeito nenhum. Procure qualquer outra coisa que eu tenho certeza que será infinitamente melhor."
bad,"Not worth the pay, a billion dollar company that can't afford a/c is not worth it, depending on the line your on you may have it easy or u may have it rough, I was on the line that always did 1000 tool boxes a day it was miserable, while I watch some others only hit 200 and take their time and they got to go home early too, they were even starting work some people 7 days a week"
bad,"This has to be the worst place to have to work. It is full of unhappy employees who are not appreciated or valued. It claims to promote diversity and inclusion but the reality is that it is very exclusive. Diversity is just a marketing claim."
bad,"-mauvais environnement de travail, résultat ils sont en quête perpétuelle d'employés"
bad,"Horrible consistency with policies, supervisors and management treat their teams with disrespect and talk down to us. Just a horrible environment to work in."
bad,Don't expect a raise unless you are in the buddy system people have been working there for over 20 years and not topped out they only do for their buddy's hard work is not valued at all no 401k for new hire's
bad,Plan to work every holiday and weekend. Do not plan real vacations. Parking is free.
bad,"une compagnie nulle, les gérants sont nuls, un service client au dessous-de la moyenne, aucun suivi des employés, de l'hypocrisie, un environnement de travail qui n'est pas sain, avec des collègues de travail désagréables, raciste, et xénophobe, les répartiteurs de jour (qui ont le plus d'ancienneté) c'est eux qui décident pour la compagnie, beaucoup de favoritisme, celle qui fait l'horaire, s'arrange pour avoir ses amis durant les shifts de travail, ils nous oublient à manger sur place, et même pour les quelques repas payés par la compagnie, ils sont surtout pour les gens de jour, en une phrase: c'est une compagnie nulle"
bad,Constantly changing programs. No consistency. Every quarter expect layoffs. They will blatantly lie to your face as well as over the phone. You have no job security what so ever. For a fortune 500 company there management team is truly unqualified to be in management and pretty much there tools and puppets.
bad,"The schedule is great, but everything they tell you is a bunch of lies, they tell you that you will be the first to get offered a new position, and turn around and offer the position to a new person. They act like the care about there employees, but basically just stare and ignore you. So I mean if you can handle management, not caring about you. Then go for it, me I work here and it’s the worst job I ever had."
bad,"This was the worst place I ever worked, management was very inexperienced and they constantly battled with each other they blame their employees for everything never even listen to any ideas they had their favorites which were people that work there for a long time other than that I would not recommend this job to anyone"
bad,It’s hot and fast paced. The nights go by so slow and no matter how hard you work it’s never good enough. Your constantly getting moved around and half the time it’s a hectic mess. They don’t care about you or what’s going on at home. Everybody is replaceable to them. Your hours change constantly and they don’t tell you until the night before.
bad,When I started there it was a good job a lot of hours plenty of overtime. For the last year and a half only getting 30 hours a week and the work  environment  went so far down it was hard to handle
bad,"Don't lie. Half of you started out there as a quick job and stayed for a year or so cause of the people."
bad,"Working long hours and management was not able to be trusted. They were constantly making decisions and then changing their minds. They did not like people who went against what they thought. I worked their along time before SBD came along, and I saw many good people get let go, because they had ideas different from SBD upper management."
bad,This job sucks.  Work every Saturday. Low low pay. People stand around while the manager just baby sits.  There’s no discipline.   Mangers have their favorites who can’t do no wrong even tho they just stand around and joke around all day. I feel like a slave here.  Everyone who works there leaves within two months.  If your a soulless vessel who likes to be away from family then this is the place for you.   They don’t hire here. They just rely on temp agencies cause no one can stand this place.
bad,"Poor management long hours."
bad,Too much politics. when it was black and Decker culture was goods. once merged with Stanley too many people left. in the name of cost cutting loosing too many knowledge
bad,"SBD Hand Tools lacks any example of management and leadership. Executive Leadership may visit once in a while but have no idea what goes on in their respective department. Employees are not valued, morale is terrible and those who talk and do nothing else get ahead. "
bad,"Forced to work and stay in my cube all the time. Manager had serious issues if I communicated with someone outside of my team. It seemed like manager had personal issues with me and made some racist comments. Manager always talked rudely, in a very condescending manner. Other members in my team were friendly but its a cut throat environment and doesn't take much to get blamed and get thrown under ""the bus"". "
bad,"People were not held accountable for scrap, rework.  Training is very lacking in regards to people are placed in areas, not really explained how to do the job, and caused the scrap, rework, and the process is not followed. Communication also is lacking so schedules are not lined out which caused a lot of downtime."
bad,"Metrics, Metrics, Metrics...That is all that is drilled into everyone's head.  All SB&D cares about is the bottom line,,to heck with the welfare of it's employees, the customer (How bad can we gouge them) or the types of technicians that they put into the field..  Inexperienced techs that are out there screwing jobs up and hacking their way through everything that is thrown at them by management.  Tempe office has some of the same management team that goes back over 10 years ago that should have been fired 10 years ago. Cut throat, back stabbing, toxic work environment..Stanley is known as the most unethical security integrators in the business."
bad,layoffs are frequent and management is old boy club with fist pounding mentality.  Yes man mentality is required to survive here among the exec team.  Management is closed minded and new ways of thinking are killed off fast.  Its a big buzz saw - steer clear.  The only good part is CEO seems good.
bad,"The work culture with Stanley Black and Decker was laid back. However, the Management Team lacked the necessary skills for team-building, team engagement, and management. The wages were low. And, there was no follow through on providing full time opportunities that was promised."
bad,Worked for almost 90 days received several raises and a promotion. Then suddenly fired claiming I missed 18 days. After proving I had not missed more than 2 they claimed poor performance and quality issues. As stated raises and promotion the promotion happened 4 days before termination.
bad,J'ai travaillé à cet endroit quelques années et je n ai jamais vue un aussi grand roulement de personnel à chaque mois et c'est  un endroit non syndiqué donc tout leurs est permis ...
bad,"Work at Retail stores. Checking inventory, planograms, and build end caps."
bad,"A lot of positive co-workers, but the company itself is corrupt and does not care for there workers."
bad,"putting out fires"
bad,"Black & Decker was a great company to work for. It really cared about their people. Stanley came in and ""merged"" with Black & Decker and took a dump on the people that got B&D to where they were when Nolan got greedier that what he was. The evident truth of the work environment is the fact that in the past year, people have been hired and have resigned within weeks or months of being hired. That says a lot about the barbaric management the company has in place. "
bad,Company assured me that my job was secure and then I was let go 2 months after they moved me to a new city. The 5M territory that I had taken over was up 20% from last year and the returns were also significantly decreased
bad,I show up first open up sometimes. Do my work . I work on everything. Tackle everyone elses projects. I train others. I make sure the manager knows what we need to get the job done. I carry keys. I offer tech suport to customers at the sales counter. I taught myself how to work on all brands of product. Management lacks. Does not manage workers and gives them freedom to what they want. Managemet is not professional with customers or workers.
bad,"Hard to work for cause they want to much and give nthing back but the basic, Not good management, no air condition or heat hard on back legs feet only one break and management plays favorites."
bad,"no clear expectations for new hires and no structured training.  no support from management. was told by upper management, that they would always take the side of the hourly over salary."
bad,The way this company is managed is the worst. The company has values but they do not follow them. The raises I was told I could get during my interview was not true. Was not told Overtime is mandatory not voluntary. There is no accountability with this company and no follow up by management when told about problems.
bad,"Fired more than 80% of workforce within my year of being there, and heard from some people who were let go couldn't get unemployment. It's a junk company unless your with the office staff or corporate"
bad,If you intend to work at Stanley be ready to kiss as many managers behinds as you can! It's the only way you'll stay employed there for the long term. And stay very friendly with HR person  or you'll be lucky to make your 90 days. And after that make sure you wait 1 year before you have a day of or vacation because you will be fired
bad,this place is absolutely terrible to work at. it is hot. a lot of overtime. when they hire on new employees they lie to them and sugar coat the truth. they tell them that we work occasional overtime and that Saturdays are volunteer. that is nothing but a bold face lie. we work 10 hours a day M-F and 8 hours EVERY Saturday.
bad,"Signed offer letter, completed drug screening and background check, received confirmation of meeting background standards AND was further ensured that a ""representative would reach out further to coordinate a start date soon""... only to receive a call hours later informing me of an ""internal change"" that would no longer allow for the ALREADY offered position. This offer letter was contingent only on work authorization, passed DT and CBC. "
bad,I dont like the company culture and work life balance does not exists
bad,Please do not apply for the customer service department. The rest of the company seems great!
bad,Believe me that Stanley does not care about thier employees. They will give you work for 2 people and they do not care if it takes you all day and sometime (depending on your position) you better take your work home because you are ridiculed in front of co-workers if you do not complete your pile of assignments. If they want you out they will team up on several different levels of mangement to make sure your life is miserable. I am not talking about Black & Decker but I am telling you how Stanley works!
bad,"Do your best, not to work there. The safety team has no idea on how to train forklift drivers, and the maintenance Supervisor/manager doesn't even know how to hire qualified employees for the correct job placement."
bad,"Black & Decker took on Stanley as part of the merger. Although all Stanley accounts came to Black &  Decker they did not expand their resources to take on the extra workload from this merger hence putting pressure on staff. "
bad,"the working conditions were awful, and it was way to hot for anybody to be working in there with no AC like i did. if they had AC it would’ve been a little easier but they treat the rookies bad"
bad,Mismanagement mixed with pitiful pay and yearly decreasing benefits to employee cost ratio.  A highly stressful cutthroat environment in which the inmates are running the prison.
bad,Honestly this was the worst experience. Employees that were there for years were VERY rude to new  individuals who started. The management didn't care
bad,"The atmosphere, management and work conditions are deplorable! The entire place is dirty (oil/dirty drip from ceiling, molding machines blow toxic air onto shop floor), mismanaged with competition and backstabbing encouraged. Employees are required to work  mandatory 6 days a week 10 hour days, and when you get hurt the company wants nothing to do with helping you or helping you get back to work."
bad,"I worked for one year before I was hired. By the time I was making full pay in my department they moved my division to China.The jobs still There are temp jobs with a few full-time people supervising,"
bad,There is no vision or strategy to develop the business in India. Management does seem to be focussing on India for petty things thereby not giving a freehold to develop the business in India
bad,"Stanley prides itself in diversity and culture which does not feel like it. Management is annoying always finding something new to complain about preaching safety yet every next day another accident occurred. Supervisors and leads play favorites they have there little group of friends who get all the big and easy orders to reach your production while the temps get stuck with the small and heavy picks. They use employees from 3 different temp agency's and they are always having hiring events that should be the first clue about working here, once work slows or they feel like they dont need you they will let you go the time I was there I got to witness them lay off 38 temp employees because they were not needed anymore and they notified them over the phone on a Sunday to not come back on Monday. Some have been there for 4-6 months and have not been hired by the company when they where told they would after 90 days, even knowing they are good workers and have good attendance but they post the openings on there website for the position that the temps are working in. Shady company and HR is very unprofessional supervisor dating workers and to much drama going on."
bad,Les personnes rabaisse les nouvelles personnes au sein de l’entreprise
bad,The management at this place was very rude and didnt really care about their employees at all. They never had a set schedule it was always TBD. They lie often about when you will be off work.
bad,"This is not a good place to work. They trade you like a slave. The manager was nasty with a very bad and intimidating aptitude again the workers and the line liders and supervisor yeying on people. The place was very hot and the job was intense, no heavy but very intense. There was not rewar, your team can process 800 pieces or 1500 pieces and there where no diference, they promes  free lunches for the team with higuest production on the week and they never giving to you. In today warehouses any money that is given to a manager, he spent with his supervisors, they keeped between then, the same happen with the salaries and promotions, is only for then. Today the environment in whare house works are realy bad, they are the closes thing to a new slave era. The companies are no focus in make the worker feel contrible and pert of the company, on the contrary they make then feel like a crinminal a somebody they are making a favor an can trough in the trash at any moment."
bad,I worked through the temp inscource so its not really Stanley fault about my time spent there. It is not a really bad place to wor. just the pay is no good.
bad,"This was a excellent job. But wen I experience racism ther it was very hard workin there. I had to resign after b ther 3 years   The new supervisory had hassled me til I finally  gav up.   Never had a supervisor to pick an harassment it me but it was difficult she let me no she was the boss an ther was nothing I can do but quit.    Since I been gone I suffer with high blood pressure an the harassment "
bad,"Mooi als je pas binnenkomt, je waant je in het beste bedrijf van het land maar werk er een paar maanden en je zal merken dat het een kindertuin is."
bad,This company is poorly run from an engineered product perspective. Top leadership does not have a clue of the importance of product development investment over time to assure a relevant product portfolio.
bad,Do not keep promises. They recruit on false promises. No clear cut strategy for business in India. More dependence on imports and less focus on manufacturing.
bad,If one of the managers doesn’t like you your canned one of the managers had it out for me while the others loved me I worked really hard and fast but she felt threatened by my ability to learn fast and pushed until they fired me
bad,Good people to work for but not my kind of thing I did like the environment but can get stressful at times but what job doesn't I just found it boring  that all
bad,Should have seen it from the beginning. After going six times... yes six times for interviews all with different people. Not even an email or call or even a response back. Made me waste so much time for nothing. They don’t didn’t even take the time to give me a call back or nothing after going 6 times to an interview. 6 plus hours wasted. Ever heard about panel interviews?
bad,I do not like speaking unfavorably about experiences because the undesirable ones are character building. Not a positive working environment. Hopefully it has improved since my tenure.
bad,they were always delaying our break times. they waited 5 minutes before we were supposed to go home to tell you to stay an extra 2 hours.
bad,"I can not give a star to any category listed because Black and Decker took over the company and absolutely ran it in the ground. They started with taking away vacation days, then bonuses and then made the employees pay outrageous amounts for health insurance and benefits also decreased. I would not recommend anyone work for them. It got even worse when they merged with Stanley. Nothing good to say about them. They got one star because this system would not let me post anything until I gave at least one star."
bad,was stating a new life a new job working in a warehouse with learing a pallet jack and production line
bad,Pues le falta mucho a la empresa en trato al personal
bad,"A typical day at work would consists of me driving to work on the highway, a hour or hour and a half to beat traffic just to get there in time. once i get there i have to deal with rude peole who dont help you if you asked. on top of that you may have to work 2 hours over but they will not tell you until after you get to work."
bad,"They make you pay for 3 of their shirts then tell you, you dont have to wear them. Gotta make it there at least 30 to 45 mins early to get a production truck which they dont pay you right for it. Could use better management.  An honestly I work 40 to 48 hours a week an only bring home $118 to $200 paid weekly. So no I wont tell or suggest anyone to work here I'm gone soon as I find another job paying at least $10"
bad,"I was physically asssaulted because I stuck up for a black man.  Stanley-Black & Decker KNEW of these concerns as I had addressed them several months earlier with the HR Manager.  They refused to address these concerns and even promoted one of the guys to be a lead man.  Unprovoked, I was viciously attacked while the lead man stood idly by.  After I came to (after blacking out),"
bad,You actually working for a company called SentryNet who owns SBD. If you’re absolutely in NEED of a job go! But stay to yourself tbh everyone has favorites from the HR manager on down to the supervisors in the Central. They don’t pay enough for the mess you deal with $12.50 to get back to back to back alarms without a break in between. Come on we have got to do better. You can’t take take take and barely give
bad,No vale la pena trabajar aquí. Mal horario y sueldo. El ambiente es dominado por personas que no tienen tino y ni siquiera son jefes. El rrhh un asco.
bad,All decisions are driven by corporate shareholders. Whenever there was a issue with sales the easy solution was to eliminate staff. Good company to start your career with but not a company to establish a career with
bad,"I was hired on through a staffing agency (which had an office at the faciility).  My direct applications were never taken into account as I did not know any supervisors or employees.  After  over a year, was STILL working for the agency.  Never had a writeup or even a warning, but was terminated for a made up reason--which should have been a warning at the most.  Was let go right in the middle of trying to buy a house.  Don't expect a direct hire unless you know someone important.  Friends of sons of supervisors walk right into the door--receiving paid vacation and up to 3X pay for working on holidays, though Strataforce employees get no paid vacation and $30 for working holidays.  Do not bother with this job.  There are better ones available..."
bad,"My time at Stanley Black & Decker started out normally and then declined. As the department grew, the amount of Supervisors grew too. It became very stressful with not having clear cut directions."
bad,"Went from AS400 to SAP.   same thing, junk. slow clunky tedious too many screens, nothing intuitive, not even close to what everybody has in there tablet at home. It took them 35 years to buy a new computer and it's not one bit any better to live with."
bad,"Overall my coworkers were fun but, you could tell the difference in the way people were treated. A lot of favoritism and bad turnover rate."
bad,"If you're looking for a basic job where you're expected to be ok with the status quo - this is for you. If you're looking for a place with culture, ability to progress, interest in innovation, etc. - there are so many other companies that will endorse and support ambitious professionals. This is where you go to be average."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend, the best days seem to be behind them. Will hire an agency over employee promotions. Constantly re-organizing and title changes. Management is inexperienced and rarely available while out traveling and enjoying conferences, which never gets communicated out. The culture is fun if you're apart of the boys club. Had great perks, but those have slowly been disappearing and you'll be so overworked you won't be allowed to partake anyway. Everyone has been jumping ship. Zero job security."
bad,The hardest  part is working on the assembly line with somebody who doesn’t have the same ambition of working like you do. It take forever to get hired on once you do your 90 days it’s still no guarantee that you will be hired on.
bad,Was let go for not reporting an injury at work. How is that possible when I filled out paper work with both black and decker and the other company and everyone that worked with me knew when i got hurt. Even my supervisor knew....
bad,"I was proud to work here until I realized how management was driven  by numbers vs. people and their development. When it comes down to it, regardless of how many training courses, diversity and inclusion initiatives, or added benefits they promote, (most remote workers in the field, commercial side, pretty much anyone outside of Corporate or GTS Headquarters do not get these benefits), SBD has an incredibly superficial way of pretending that they care about their employees."
bad,working at Stanley Black & Decker was challenging and always changing. I thoroughly enjoyed working with the Avaya locations as well as learning other systems such as Cisco and Five 9.
bad,"Except the time & management working is fun, most of the time you will be working on the new product development.When it comes to work culture beware."
bad,"loved the job,   the management team sucked,   there is no drive to work towards in the company.        they just see you as a number not as a person."
bad,"This place is a horrible place to work.  You can't miss 1 day of training or you get kicked out. Management here is a joke, they do not treat their employees well at all and are full of empty promises."
bad,Currently working in a contract position with one day off per week. We are overworked with minimal days off. Working conditions are bad and management does not show any concern to complaints of the employees.
bad,A Stanley é uma empresa Boa para trabalhar o ruim é só o salário que e muito pouco.
bad,"Many hours spent alone in stores. They expect autonomy while also enforcing a lot of rules. An interest in tools is recommended. There is a wide range of different types of managers, it's really just luck of the draw if you end up getting a good one or not. Going above and beyond is expected from day one, regardless of how comfortable you are in the position."
bad,"Walk employees out that have a lot of tribal knowledge, QA in very lax. when employees miss something supervisors make it the employees problem. No help in the structure or teaching."
bad,"benefits are very poor"
bad,"Very few minorities in management positions"
bad,Stanley Black & Decker does not create a work/life balance atmosphere for their employees. They make you work required weekends and holidays in a lot of cases.
bad,At this job you com in get a set of tools to test . you will be given instructions and then just follow them and report any problems.I learned a little about power tools and how they work but not much.the hardest part is the repetitive work cycle you do day to day.no real enjoyable part of this job its a job and that is it
bad,Lack of acknowledgment to employees and unstable pay was one of the cons about working with Stanley black & Decker . The pros of working for Stanley black and Decker was the flexible hours .
bad,Entirely too much to share so I'll leave you with this.  SBD is HR heavy.  Tremendous talent and dedicated employees.  Real team environment.  A handful of people in leadership roles don't deserve to work at this amazing and innovative company which is why I'm leaving.
bad,"Sociopathic management, unreasonable hours expected, no opportunity for advancement, old filthy mfg. plant, abusive supervisor.  I had to work 12 hours a day and still could not keep up with the demands.  I desperately needed an assistant but none was provided."
bad,"Terrible place to work with no opportunities for advancement or a raise.  Hours are reasonable and the work isn't that hard, but the management and corporate structure is awful."
bad,"Very stressful place to work. Was unhappy the last few years there. Work gets real slow last 2 months in the year, lay offs. Have to watch your back, can be cut throat."
bad,"Stressful, you remain accountable for someone else's job details, there was favoritism, production workers were balanced about 50/50 where half would work, and do a great job, you had the other half that were there to draw a check. There were 4 spills."
bad,"I worked at the Greenfield location. I feel as if they didn't understand the balance between work and home life. We would be expected to work 12 hour days at a moments notice, 7 days a week. While I loved the people I worked with, the operation of the plant and pay for my time was NOT worth the stress."
bad,was a welder in the production setting was a very repetitive job that got very old very fast was an ok experience and helped me hone my welding and et better in that feild
bad,"reuniones capacitacion  "
bad,Determine machining processes and tool implementation. Provide documentation of CNC machining operations for controlled software system
bad,This company has great products as well as alot of great people working for them. What is lacking is alot of the management team forget that they to had to start somewere. Being able to train and modavate is a key element of a manager. The abbility to do this with out discougering the employee is how you keep a low turn over rate......
bad,"Their own outplacement people in MD call B&D a ""toxic place to work"". Managment consists of people who cant actually perform the work - they just got very good at talking about other people's work and did very little of their own. Very unsupportive and they tend to favor people who are not in a protected class - "" under 40"" then out the door. I relocated from another division and truly regretted it after about two months."
bad,I really wouldn't recommend working there. They don't listen and believe only what they want to believe. if something is wrong they will not listen to what you have to say and only believe what they are seeing
bad,"As an intern, I was brought in to help the Demand planning team, but that was NO structured training or culture of team support. I was given spreadsheets and asked to deliver recommendations of SKUs for the sales team. My internship was during the holiday season and I supported the least predictable client - AMAZON. "
bad,"If you're the kind of person to break rules and fall in with all the bad boys and accept that this was the way to be you'll do fine. I saw who was doing what and distanced myself from the bad crowd.For example, making junk parts and hiding them, not punching out when leaving shop property, instead of a half hour lunch stretching it to one , two or three hours,making off sets to someones machine so parts were out of tolerance while their back was turned...so many things I saw, but I kept my mouth shut and did my work. After not associating with those guys I was not in the click and my parts were sabotaged."
bad,No do not work for them your just a number. They are down sizing also . You get no increase in pay . Your just a number with them.. They have shut down at least 16 service centers in the last 5 years too.
bad,"Typical day at work:"
bad,Moral was very low. Not enough pay when compared to other local factories. Not managed well at all and lack of communication thru chain of command. Only good thing was flexibility of hours when you have kids and appointments to go to.
bad,"Our supervisor was always disrespectful to everyone, expect those who had been there many years. The work was very labor intensive and stressful, also it was made very clear that I was simply a dime a dozen worker and easily replaceable. I worked basically 56 hours a week for 5.5 months straight, and then work slacked off around Christmas to the point of almost part time. But I guess it cant be helped since I was working as a temp for a large fortune 500 company."
bad,Over the years the company changed hands three times and progressively got worse from an employee and customer service friendly place of employment to work.
bad,"do not recognize the work, you can spend years working with them to be very good at what you do, be multitask and still never make you permanent, its policy discriminates against Hispanics and more if you do not speak English very well. they care more to speak their language to be a good worker."
bad,"Het is een goede opstap om te leren hoe het binnen internationale organisatie werkt."
bad,"Interacting with diverse but largely commercial client base. Multi-task with all local functions from sales, service, cash, inventory & ship & receive.  This is a 4 person local sales/service branch so personality drama is a constant. Aside from daily/monthly numbers, corporate doesn't appear much interested in local employee relations and management"
bad,Get great annual reviews. Management says you are eligible for wage increase. But it never happens.  Some employees have been 5 years without  a wage increase.
bad,Not all of there managers are good my mine in the paint shop is the best I have ever had great dude he encourages you to do well the company does not appreciate the hard workers some of the bosses do but they don’t take care of there people as they should a lot of favoritism and criticism
bad,"Knowing that this was a temporary position, I appreciated my work schedule but would have liked to be challenged more.   The company lays off all temporary positions around this time."
bad,no benefits low wage contract work where your considered part time because they only give you 36 hours a week. then they fire you before your hired full time stating operational changes and then have a job fair the following week to loop people in
bad,I worked from them for a year and ended up leaving for 6 month for medical leave. In the beginning was alright but the time I came back was awful. Stress level there was so high that people started to leave. The pay isn't that good and no advances in pay at all.
bad,"It's okay if you are beginning your career in this field. There are a lot of things that could change. There is no bonus structure, and the yearly pay increase is a hit or miss on certain years. You will work more hours than you are paid for."
bad,no fair work day always over -time never optional long work hours and you might have to work multiple departments and would love to be able to spend more time with my family
bad,I was not happy with the work place..and that’s why I left Stanley Black and decker Stanley Black decker don’t care if my bills are payed or not ..so I decided I had to leave.
bad,productive enviorment and fast paced for highly energetic people.must be able to work long hours and overtime is mandatory..not enough time with your family..good for people who are single or retirees
bad,I would come into work and get my desk ready for the day.  I was in the Banking department so I was responsible for paying the bills for the company.  To do this I would use my procedure manuals.  We had many different ERP's so it came in handy because it would be difficult to memorize the procedure for each one.
bad,Leadership not always receptive to work life balance changes and business conduct of managers. Behavioral norms need to be adhered to within the culture. Processes lack consistency in adoption. They are seeking to transform the work culture.
bad,Management didn't care about their people at all. They were sold and all manufacturing was leaving. So that why I quit before I lost my job. After leaving six months later they shipped all the machinery to mexico.
bad,Rude people who talk down to you. The team leads never knew what they were doing but expected you to know right off the bat. If you got injured at work they just swept it under the rug so that they didnt have to pay.
bad,You would get to work at 7 probably wait around for about 2 hours for one truck and then get sent home at 12:00. On a good day 3:00. Manager showed favoritism so it was hardly work
bad,No I did not like black & Decker's at all the supervisors was very rude the employees that was very rude no I did not like it at all I stayed there a couple of months and then I left
bad,"you cannot excel at this company. and the pay is not compatible to cost of living. I will not refer anyone to work here, because you will have to work as a temporary employee for a year before being considered employed and there are no benefits."
bad,I do not have anything to contribute to this section. It is not my place to evaluate this company because I no longer work there and have no knowledge of their current practices or if they are even in business anymore. Plus I do not want to expose myself to any liability.
bad,"Processes in place hindered the progress for project management.  when offered to assist with correcting some of the processes, the organization was opposed to any change."
bad,"I was hired as a temp to train for the new Weekend Shift in Cheraw. I was so happy to find a weekend job with what I thought was a good company. I was complimented on the work I was doing, but eventually, things slowed down and they couldn't even find work for their full-time temps.  I was told not to come in and call instead when things picked up.  During this time, they hired a new HR manager and my supervisor transferred to another shift.  The temp agency rep was also replaced,  leaving me with no one that knew what I was supposed to be doing. It was total confusion. After several months of checking with my supervisor in Cheraw to see if there was any work, I was finally told they decided not to have a weekend shift after all.  I really counted on this job but instead, I felt like I was being punished for something I had no control over."
bad,it only has gotten worse from when I first began there things are going downhill they nag at you everyday even when you are doing what you are supposed to be doing they pick on certain people everyday for stupid things
bad,There are too many employees related to management a lot of favoritism. My manager was not a machinist didn't even know how to turn the machines on or anything about them all he care about were the number of part you made. I cared about quality and they some people making a lot of scrap.
bad,"I was assigned several branches in the U.S. and I had a very good working relationship with each branch. Because I knew what they expected in terms of performance and service and that they trusted my experience and work ethic, we meshed well."
bad,Work very hard for little pay very stressing and cut throat environment teamwork was not practiced and people skills were not practiced just wished it was better
bad,"This place has potential to be an awesome company to work for, and in fact I continually hear that it used to be before Stanley bought them out some years ago. The way they handle communicating and delegating overtime is like on a need to know basis, they will wait till the last day of the week to tell you you have to come in on your 6th day. The pay is mediocre, they have a lot of temps so most of the people who work there, don't really care about their job because they are temps and have no intention of sticking around for long. The health insurance is ok, but not the greatest, other company benefits and perks are typical but not outstanding. Communication and company moral, pride, integrity are blow par. The over all atmosphere is oppressive. It's terribly hot in the summers, icy cold in the winters, and there is a general sense that the employer does not care about the employee beyond making numbers and production. Straight 8 hour shift, one 20 min break for the whole night. Not fun."
bad,No mentoring and developing people but a lot of punishment to them based on wrong assessment; Immature HR kids in place thinking they know everything but they are childish; many a times upper management tend to keep their eyes closed and just do what helps them out.
bad,You get to work with a multicultural team mainly from Latin America. Company got new management recently and going through a transition phase. Good benefits.
bad,Otimos beneficios e estrtura porem pessimos gestores e ambiente de trabalho
bad,I worked at Stanley black and decker in Brewster and I must say the work environment is very hostile in the shipping department. They are bad envious people who try to make you life impossible the morning shift. Manager he a nice guy. I wouldn’t work there again
bad,empresa com ótimos  benéficos  porem  péssimo ambiente
bad,I don't get to spent time with my family. super hot tast pace job raises for inspector benifits. You work 6 days a week and work 7 hours no enough pay to find a house.
bad,The job was a decent job but after needing to have surgery they were not willing to wait a matter of a few more days for my doctor to release me back to full duty and terminated my job.
bad,"Zeer hoge werkdruk in een wanordelijke omgeving."
bad,"Flexible work hours"
bad,They are not really fair in how they treat people. I felt they could do better and that way more people would wanna work there. They also let you go for all the wrong reasons
bad,they don't care about personal well being. I was throwing up and wasn't allowed to leave because the company was behind schedule. I will never go back
bad,"Gran empresa para aprender y desarrollarse, mala estructura y liderazgo"
bad,"The company could be good to work for but there is a negative energy in the place which depresses a lot of the staff. When working there, you get the feeling that you are just numbers on a spreadsheet rather than an actual person. No respect between departments."
bad,"company has great potential, it has gone through to many managers that has come in and made changes, left with everything up in the air."
bad,"Management in the marketing department is uncomfortable with employees seeking development and struggles with onboarding outside of the company. A typical workday involves status meetings, constant emailing back & forth between the product managers and the brand team due to lack of formulated process & expectations."
bad,"S- B&D is a good place to work for motivated persons with a good work ethic. Breaks are almost non-existent. There is no clock-in grace period, so if you are even one minute late you will receive an occurrence. The pay (in most areas) is not commensurate to the work performed. Very little room for advancement. Little or no warning of mandatory overtime."
bad,"To be considered for the Sales Coordinator role in the SMDP program at Stanley Black & Decker you need; a recent 4 year degree from a big school (think Alabama or Michigan) with a solid GPA, a high energy cheerleader type personality, and excellent communications skills. If you have those qualities there are dozens"
bad,"This is a wonderful company to work for i have learnt a lot in the previous years, ive worked for them under an agency though. They don't take us serious late payments or not pay me at all. My day would be getting into the warehouse 7H30 i start in a meeting. then pull orders for the RDC, pack the orders for RDC then despatch the orders. Drive a fork lift when required"
bad,Quanity was more important then quality. I never felt secure with my job because of watching lines be moved to Mexico and China. Eventually Fayetteville site was completely moved to Mexico.
bad,"I've always enjoyed my job and most of the hard working people where I work. I've learned many skills working under the Avdel brand,"
bad,management and HR was down right terrible. That would asked you for advice and tell the department what you said.Causing trouble between coworkers.Plant manager did not have a clue on what went on around there. HR was useless what else do I need to say......
bad,"same routine"
bad,"I was employed in the Two Harbors MN facility.  The location was great, the work was ok.  The culture of the company needs work.  They are not diversified very well and go through a lot of boom and bust cycles."
bad,"I learned problem solving efficiently and agility "
bad,People will treat you well as a start and after about a year everything goes down hill. they treat you poorly over work you  deny you raises call you on your days off to come fix a machine move you all over the plant so on and so forth. would not recommend
bad,"The only issues there is that "
bad,"If you're willing to give up your family life, jump at a moments notice, work long hours on the weekend, then this is the place for you. If you don't kiss butt you fall out of favor with management. Benefits are good. Pay is good. Micromanagement at it's best."
bad,"Many middle managers are excellent, including mine while employed there, but the company constantly cuts cost by letting anyone who makes a good salary for their experience go in favor of newer, less experienced people who will work for less. This happened just as I was going to work there, and happened again within a month of my leaving. I saw the handwriting on the wall and left before I got caught up in the next wave of layoffs and firings. Managers there constantly undermine and backstab each other. The ones who don't, such as mine, are easy victims for the rest. It's a company culture that is toxic in the long term, but you get great benefits for the short time you are there."
bad,"First off, you never know whether or not you have to work a weekend until the day before, so you can never really make any plans. Also we a understaffed, but management does not believe that we need any more employees, so everyone is doing the job of 2 or 3 people.  Pay is below average, from what I hear about other companies where they perform the same duties as us. Two good things are job security and plenty of overtime.  As long as you show up, you are not in danger of losing your job.  Management has now moved our Quarterly ends to Monthly Ends, to increase their numbers, so at least once a month you will work over everyday plus Saturday."
bad,"in de zomer  een ieder is vroolijk"
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with people who were committed to each other and continued doing their jobs with dedication and commitment despite the hardships we were under.
bad,"Stanley Security has a version of the program I launched in the US that is quite successful in Canada.  Instead of learning from their success, they tried to reinvent the wheel and failed.  Within 6 months the expansion was deemed financially unstable and they shut down the division, laying off approximately 95% of the employees they had hired.  I heard great things about some of the other Stanley divisions but did not feel like the security business was run well or planned to succeed.  I feel I was hired in such a way that I was bound to fail."
bad,"Over the past year, SBD has executed at least 4 MASS LAYOFFS.  Job security is non-existent.  They intentionally do not promote female trade-workers in their advertisements and the management culture is dominated by white males, with Good Ole Boy mentality, which is directly driven by the example of Global Tools and Storage leadership."
bad,Very difficult working environment as a result of the pressure for the company to deliver financial results. Leadership and management in general is overly demanding creating difficulties to have a healthy work / life balance.
bad,Enjoyed taking apart tools and fixing the tool or deeming it unrepairable. The co workers were great to work with and most were helpful in  helping repair a difficult  tool
bad,"I wish I would of knew how this place is! Very micro managed! There are no time to use the restroom, eat or even breath! Make sure you know what you're getting into. This place has a very high turn over rate because of bad management."
bad,A typical day work was unfairness overall. I learned to do production labels and was helpful to gain some knowledge. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the higher level positions because due unfairness
bad,"Neochota vyjít vstříc, šikana na pracovišti, náhlá změna služeb (máte mít ranní a oni za vámi v pondělí přijdou s tím že od úterý máte odpolední a prostě musíte jít na odpolední a to že nemůžete je nezajímá)"
bad,"Salarios baixos, clima interno sem colaboração, pouco apoio de vice presidencia para capacitar times, liderança e projetos inovadores."
bad,I didn't mind working there. The work was very easy to understand and straight to the point. I was doing everything they told me and doing the best I could.
bad,You make repair at a bench for 8 hours. Every repair is timed and tracked. Your productivity is tracked and managed closely. Your raises are based off productivity performance. Error in repair or product destruction by customer which isn’t your fault is deducted from your positive performance progress. Expect minimal pay and little annual increase.
bad,"It was good place at the beggining, had to wait long time to get my holiday form back, menagment was the worse, not nice, two faced, if they didnt like you you should run away ,good money but no overtime, sucked with no reason"
bad,typical day at work requires attention to detail but management there is not helpful at all and you can show them you have team effort but that does not matter
bad,Poor organization of human resources.  Lack of appropriate job training and no support system in place for questions. Cultural divisions existed between functional groups.
bad,"We take care of our customer, Out techs fix our customers tools on the spot and get them back to the job. If its in the field or a job at home, we get the job done."
bad,"they cut your hours a lot, work is supposed to pick up, but it has'nt for several weeks. but the co workers are chill, upper management tends to be a joke"
bad,This job was interesting. I never had an issue showing up for work on time and being productive. I enjoyed doing warehouse work and will do it again if needed.
bad,Stanley does not care about it's employess as Black and Decker did.
bad,In 21 years I learned many skills such as running many different machines. I learned metrology and metallurgy. I learned how to measure steel and perform time sensitive projects.
bad,"it's a good place to work in as most managers deal with us friendly specially top management"
good,Not sure how permanent employees are treated. I don't know what the actual pay would be like now. it is a supply and demand industry and we were there to make qoutas
good,"CribMaster is a industry leader that has fallen on their laurels, with no innovation and a lack of leadership they are destine to fall short in the foreseeable future."
good,"Отсутствие перспектив роста, постоянный стресс на работе"
good,Stanley Black & Decker is a great company to work for to get the best all round warehouse experience. Training is exceptional. The only downfall with the company is compensation for your experience. Plus procrastination is the way of life when it comes to raises.
good,It was good place to wort at beginning but manager change. Bad management. They were only for self promoting. They didn’t care for internal or external customers. All about numbers.
good,"Was a good company to work for until they bought black and Decker , reason bought them was because both CEOs played golf together and black and Decker chairman lost money in the stock market crash, by merging he "
good,"i didn't hate it. They really do try to be a up to date fun company to work for.  However, they miss the mark. It's not a bad place to work, but I wouldn't go out of my way for a position here"
good,you are out of the race if you are not fast enough. One of the highly motive company. Very good opportunity if you are a part of Global sourcing team.
good,"It is an ok place to work, you just have to make an effort to learn on your own. Management does not take the time to teach. So it made it challenging at times"
good,Not enough help. Old mind thinking and no training. You have to train yourself. How do a temp worker make more than an actual employee who hired direct?
good,It wasn't absolutely terrible but I will never return there. Too many demands but not enough compensation for it. Multi tasking is a must there but not a hard job. Assembly lines are easy if you have your head in the game.
good,"Good work place"
good,alright besides the breaks and blame stuff on temps
good,"SBD is a high paced results oriented company. I was able to advance in several positions over my 4 year tenure at the company, taking part in numerous continuous improvement projects that focused on droving out waste, to improve overall profitability. As a Supply Chain leader for one of the divisions, I was able to take part in business acquisitions, lean manufacturing processes, contract establishment, risk mitigation activities along with driving daily local and international sourcing activities."
good,"I learned how to put in lock,draws, ribitt slides and drawers, put on pop labels and box and ship tool boxes. You have to move at a fast pace because you have a hang like you have to pull off of to."
good,"As with most companies, the main concern of this company is making money. They would eliminate positions to let go of your everyday worker but would keep on high paid managers and hire high paying managers from outside the US."
good,Long hours and weekends. Very hot work environment. I worked in assembly and made all decicions with little to no help from managment.  Enjoyed the people that worked for me and did my best to provide them with a safe and stress free day.
good,Un hang was fast pase and you had to be able to pull off the parts and still not scratch the parts. As you assembled the correct parts together they went down the line to the next person and so on. The toolboxes range in different sizes so they can be very heavy to not at all. After there put together they go to a inspector then to the shipping then to the customer
good,I really wish I could have stayed working there but like it it was a really good place to work the people were great the work is not hard they adjust to your needswish things would have worked out differently far as a ride situation for me otherwise I still be there
good,Stressful; fear instilled in salaried employees from corporate level in Connecticut down to local management. Benefits are generous; pay is mediocre. Opportunity for advanced only for workaholics.
good,"The best part about this company is it's people.  I've worked in multiple positions within this organization and those that surround you are the best in the industry.  There are opportunities for advancement but can require relocation and/or travel.  For those willing to put the work into it and make some life adjustments can find themselves with some career growth opportunities.  This is a great place to learn about the many aspects of professional and consumer buying habits.  "
good,"I learned a lot but its time for me to move on. The job was not great but tolerable. The salary, perks and benefits are well below what you would expect."
good,Did not like working in the Shelbyville facility. They take advantage of people and their life. A very greedy company with little or no care for employees.
good,Complete lack of compassion for employees. Benefits are good but the working environment is inhumane.  There is no work/life balance..  Employees are not valued regardless of level.  Input is not valued. Lip service is the order of the day.
good,"Management can be lacking, not communicative with out of office employees, don't really know what goes into the production lines. Other then that not a bad work environment."
good,the hardest part to me is that we cant go to the restroom until some person go to cover you. and some times they forget or they take a lot of time to do it.
good,"Great stepping stone job.  Forget about great merit increases every year.  They just had another salary freeze in 2018.  They do great on paper - buying up competition, spreading out all over the world, etc, but it does nothing for the employee.  How do you think they get all that money?  They need cheap labor, including engineers.  Well, unless you are high on the food chain, where there is limited space.  If you aren't getting bonuses, forget about it.  I was there over 10 years.  I waited too long.  Get in and out before you get stuck in a dead end.  If you are in your 50's, you can really forget about it.  You are probably too expensive and you'll  be first on the list when the next layoff comes around.  Maybe.  Layoffs come almost every year just before Christmas.  Some times you get lucky and they decide not to.  But what a way to live.  The excuse is there is always a ""headwind that is causing us to cut-back/layoff"".  Then after all this cutting back, they buy a competitor for a Billion dollars cash!  Wow! "
good,"After several buy outs and transitions, jobs are uncertain at best.  No feeling of permanence.  Always feeling that with the poor management,  your job could be eliminated."
good,"When I was with Stanley Black & Decker it was just Black & Decker.  The merger was just closing as I left.  Black & Decker was a good company to work for, but really old and really slow to change.  Very limited opportunities."
good,"Stanley Black and Decker can be a good company however, their pay structure could be better. There are certain department within the company that is beyond stressful. They focus more on numbers rather than the employees more of a churn and burn atmosphere rather than wanting people to advance to other part of the company. But in the time of me working there i have met some great people and can be a family like feeling at times."
good,Dedicated 2 years of my life to the place. Loved what I did. Worked tirelessly day and night. Yet when times got hard they gave me no chance and threw me to the wolves
good,"Challenging work that is high stress, with unrealistic deadlines for projects.  Everything is dependent of the division you are working in so basically if you are part of a good division then the experience is very different. Main focus is only on financials and making revenue numbers per quarter no long term vision, planning or job security."
good,Don't get paid for the right amount that it should be. Management are not on top of the problem. Nice people to be working with. There is a temp company inside that are willing to work with you if you talk to the right person.
good,"Easy going supervisor, working there was hard but medium stress .if you had family emergency family came first unhappy or distracted employees cause low productivity"
good,Good upper management that is willing to help with employee needs. Some team leads are not the best and handle themselves in a way that can make an employee's day stressful. If you're looking for a job that you can easily move around to different departments this would be great company to work for.
good,Je begint de dag met het nemen van een stapel labels en begint met orderpicken. Het is elke dag hetzelfde ritueel dus qua leerinhoud is er niet zo veel. De collega's waren over het algemeen heel plezant en het was fijn om te werken. Het leukste van de baan was het mogen rondrijden met een machine.
good,"Stanley Black & Decker, an S&P 500 company, is a diversified global provider of hand tools, power tools and related accessories, mechanical access solutions and electronic security solutions, engineered fastening systems, and more."
good,"Don't believe a word management says. They have no power and often don't know the real deal under the Stanley ownership. Caring for the employees and growing them is a thing of the past. Work 24/7 if that's what it takes. Working environment and condiitons are excellent. Cleanliness, appearance, maintenace of the property is paramount. Not having opporunity to communicate with the upper management and undertstand the direction and strategy the company in embracing is cause for much anxiety."
good,"Stanley black and decker is a wonderful company worldwide. Now the allentown operations management is not so great, lack of communication between planet workers and up front management. Also employee appreciation and acknowledgement of performance abilities within plant is horrible, Under paid. They work you like a dog and dont appreciate the hard work accomplished"
good,"management expectation was not clear even management team was keep on changing & my superiors also, no clear direction of work & in house politics was there."
good,"Stanley is in cost cutting mode, that is why I'm looking for a job.  "
good,Often have to come on weekends for overtime even though there is a weekend shift. Operations manager oversteps boundaries and doesn't really know what's going on. Makes decisions in a panic.
good,"Call center is micro managed.  Supervisor constantly walking around trying to catch people, at the very least, getting a drink of water.  No formal training.  Team lead does the training.  Terrible and degrading attitude which makes it seem like she doesn't want to be there.  Constant turnover.  Only good part was jeans every day."
good,It was a great experience learning how to ship material and also learning how to do inventory. Stanley helped me learn about tools as well and assembling.
good,"Foram quase 4 anos muito intensos, de grande aprendizado, com um grande enriquecimento do meu background profissional."
good,Management keeps changing all the way up through upper management. It doesn't effect me as much as it does our sales teams. Sometimes change is good. Time will tell.
good,I have to say your fellow employee’s seemed really nice. I like the people who worked here. They are good down to earth folks. The work is not so much. You will run 1000’s and 1000’s of the same parts. Many parts per hour. This is a job where it is very dirty and you will run large orders of parts. I was always worried about catching some kind of diseases because of the filth of the shop walls and floors. The building was old and moldy.     I guess this depends on what area you work in. Very loud because of all the hammer type forging machine. Very hot because of the heat ovens and hot forgings. Pretty good benefits.
good,It’s good job but the management is not so good. I didn’t really enjoy it. I ask to be off few day for death in family i was told only one day. I think that’s unacceptable.
good,its a factory. what else can i say. typical factory. very concerned about safety. but fall begins massive overtime. minium of 10 hrs a day 6 and 7 days a week.
good,Was different working at black and decker got to learn a lot about tools. Got to meet great people working with great people. Got to learn how to use so many tools was a good place. Got to learn a lot of things worked hard stocking and unloading trucks but always had a good time ok don't have much more to say its been to long since I worked there said has much as I can remember
good,"Travail d'usine pour l'été, bonne formation mais ne correspond pas à mon profil"
good,I would not recommend the job at Black and Decker unless you love heat with no air conditioning and fast paced working where you do not get any benefits from the company and also you are extremely under paid for the amount of labor you put into the company.
good,"SBD is a great place to work. It all depends on what department and what project you work on. The company and its products are great, however, i do believe its upper level management need lots and lots of training. If you are a recent grad student, this place will be perfect to start. But if you are someone with experience i will say think twice, just because the people you will be working with or for need a little more training on how to lead a project or be good managers. You will be exepcted to work 10+ hrs, there is not sick leave. you get PTO which is a combination of vacation and sick leave. Therefore, if you get 2 weeks of PTO that means Sick leave and vacation combined. In other wrods if you get sick for a week, you only have 1 week left of vacation. Many people come sick to work, and give it to the other people in the office ( i think this is SBD culture ). If you are someone looking into working at SBD, i will say do your research on the culture, the manager you wil be working for and the project."
good,"Highly competitive and fast paced environment. Great benefits, but very little opportunity for career advancement. I did understand the true meaning of quality and customer service with this company."
good,It was  a good job to have in college.  I thought it was pretty standard issue in terms of call centers.  I might go back if i could get into a different part of the company.
good,Entreprise avec de bonne ressources et de bonne méthodes techniques
good,"Be careful when you negotiate your salary and benefits. I never imagined they wouldn't offer sick days. You have to use up your vacation which they call ""paid time off"". So if you get 2 or 3 weeks paid time off, which I thought was vacation, it means for whatever you need it for. You could be out sick a week and then you only have one more week of vacation. "
good,"This is a good place to work as long as you have a good boss, which I had before. Benefits are ok, not great but do exist. People are good people. Only two problems: it is way too political place, so as long as you have some boss how cares about you, otherwise you will stay in your job forever.This company became only meetings and conference calls all day long. I felt very unproductive before I decided to leave."
good,A my time at Stanley I experienced multiple management changes alone with high turnover. As an executive assistant I was not communicated with directly which caused confusion along with insecurity in my position.
good,"Poor work life balance, Great products, Good company, Highly political, less experienced people being hired and taking decision making responsibilities."
good,Only higher management will be benefited in this organization. Field working person has no value in this organization. Nobody is there to listen the difficulties and nobody will help you to make your goal.
good,"I enjoyed my job it was just temporary,but other then that it was a good work place.T he plp was great to work around they were very friendly and helpfull."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Stanley.  I learned a decent amount and was compensated well.  However, the company is growing and focus only on growing more.  I felt I was treated as a number or tool for growth and not a person."
good,Like working here but theirs no opportunity for advancement or growth. The management is not good at all. They tell you one thing and do another. The hardest part of my job is pulling heavy pallet that weight over a 1000 pounds with a pallet jack by hand. Been asking to get trained on the fork lift for 3 years and they keep giving me the run around. The most enjoyable part about my job is that I work alone.
good,"Stanley-Black&Decker went from an employee focused company to a profit based business when acquired by Stanley Works. No one is safe, no one's job is safe from moving it to China to save costs. Shame."
good,"The Mississauga head office is generally a so-so place to work at."
good,"Good company, to work for if you live near by and if your are willing to do a manual labor and sometimes very stressful"
good,"daily visual inspections of the boiler, which meant climbing up and down inside the boiler between the elements in dusty conditions. was an experience I enjoy, because I realised inspection is not only an office type or clean walk on site."
good,"Colleagues are good and mostly young and transitional, but the overall culture is conservative and traditional in the HQ @ New Britain. This is the type of place where you sit in your cubicle and talk to no one or people assume you aren't working. "
good,I'm working third shift now I need a first shift job now. The company has made some management changes and the company has changed not to my likings.
good,start off building drills to get line started to be ahead.I learned the in an outs of the drills and meet great people.
good,"Work long hard hours in heat, which don't mind the hard work but would like to be compensated better for the work being done."
good,"he aprendido mucho ,he obtenido mucha experiencia en mi puesto de trabajo me gusta mi trabajo y lo que hago .."
good,"Environnement de travail productif et agreable."
good,"Be prepared for big corporate at SBD. While it can be great if your a manager, others are often little more than a number. Benefits are good, but expect to be lowballed on the offer... if you do manage to negotiate a reasonable salary, expect to be put on the short list for your position to be closed when experiencing  “tough financial headwinds”."
good,A great company.  However because of the size it depend too much on numbers and metrics and not the employees.  I worked at a new site with all new equipment so not much is needed to troubleshoot beside setup.  However i was often penalized for not meeting numbers that older departments have.
good,Here at Stanley black and decker I strive to commit and perform to the best of my abilities. No matter where I go nothing will ever compare to the people after 10 years
good,It’s a decent place to work. Engineering and engineering support get beat up a bit on the regular basis. Advancement is slow and minimal. It’s good as long as you hire in at the position and pay you intend to stay at.
good,Was working the 5am-330pm shift and I am not a morning person kept trying to be moved to nights and it never happened tried my best to keep the job but wasent in the cards....the work was easy....assembly line.....somewhat tedious but shift went fast
good,Benefits are great but a lot of reorganization to where there is no job security. Can be petty internally as well. Not a lot of support from management from VP and higher.
good,face pace hard work hot areas cold areas lots of lifting must be able to stand for long periods short breaks hardest part of the job is loading the truck alone machines tend to break down alot
good,"Great coworkers, easy job. The work is simple. Very close net employees. Great management. And the pay was worth it. I would go back if they call me.."
good,"Too many meetings, not enough time to get the work done. Too many interdepencies make it difficult to make departmental changes. Benefits are not that great."
good,"Good environment to grow, but, you must be willing to work around the clock for it.  Amazing perks and benefits.  Company's philosophy about the value of employees is poor."
good,"The pay is low, the hours are long, the work is hard the shop is very old and dirty, maybe has mold on the walls. This place is old and very dirty. The bathrooms and they only have 2 are one the other side of the building and are always flooding with water.The benefits are minimal,You have to take out everything from you pockets, belt, shoes, phone, watch and go thru a metal detector every night when you leave work. The one good thing was the people that worked there are pretty good people."
good,"If management supports you it's a great place to work. Very different experience depending on the various business units. The culture of constant reorganization is difficult to get used to for some.  Work-life balance is a challenge, but if you make it to leadership level, the compensation is nice."
good,I dealt with a lot of pettiness and unprofessional behavior. This was only one department in the company though. I am sure there were other areas that had a more professional atmosphere and promoted advancement.
good,"Work life balance is terrible at the Gorham, ME facility.  Forced overtime situations for hourly employees has created low morale and the middle management team is driven to make ""the numbers"" at the expense of the employee's and their family's time."
good,I take every job I work very seriously this job is intended for part-time only and I was recently at this Stanley Black & Decker in Fort Mill South Carolina. This job is very different from that one in Fort Mill but I will admit that is a little bit more competitive and a quick quite bit more stressful. I believe that management lacks on how to properly speak to their employees and everybody is not on one accord. But this is just a part time job for me so I clearly stay out of the way of negativity in the lack that it has. Just do your job and go home . part-time only works 4 hours a night so it's not that bad if you only there for the money. But from what I have experienced so far I could never work there for 8 hours at night.
good,Upper management seem to care a lot about all the assembly workers. They would bring in catered meals and lettuce all set and eat as a family. They would do raffles giving away free products that we had built in house. It was family oriented!
good,"Reading orders and pulling orders for different companies. Packing them in to boxes per order, then taping boxes and putting labels on the boxes to be shipped out to customers."
good,"A typical work day at Stanley is composed of about 150 emails all asking for different things such as requesting sub contractors for projects, equipment orders and invoice statuses. Pulling contracts and fire inspections for customer. The most challenging part of it is the simplest things require a lengthy process which works against fast paced environment. The enjoyable part of the job is the hour break and location. When looking at the size of company, the amount of work, roles and responsibilities you are in charge of  the pay is almost minimal. overall its is a challenging job considering the previously mentioned but not rewarding."
good,I worked at two paint lines during my tenure here. On one paint line there were ample opportunities for overtime and I managed to make great pay. Usually get the full weekend off so that provides time for leisure between work. The coworkers and management were all nice but there were not very many opportunities to learn new tasks and become more acquainted with the operations of a factory. The work was relatively easy compared even to high stress fast food employment I've had experience with that pays much little. I would recommend it to anyone who needs work but look elsewhere if you want to grow in an industry.
good,"The company offers excellent training; however, the work life balance and pay structure are poor. Because the company is so large, it seems a lot of ""balls get dropped""."
good,Slechte doorgroei naar verdere functies en lange periode tot vaste aanname
good,"Great work /life balance. However, due to the high turnover with temporary employees due to frequent call outs the day after payday, staffing and cross training are a bit of a challenge."
good,Worked there for a year and was treated very poorly outside of my immediate team. The company is very transactional to both employees and customers.
good,"Work is very challenging because major performance Indicator is Inventory control and satisfy Internal customer needs."
good,"learned about the parts."
good,always had alot of rooms to clean. once your list of rooms was finished you was free to leave.
good,New challenges met each day. Solutions need to be quick. It is a very challenging and good place to learn.
good,"check product to make sure they ran properly, had to plug them up and run them"
good,"My opinion is that it's a good place to work, "
good,Too many changes to keep any signifiant momentum moving the business forward.  Senior Management changes cause a shift in direction and stalls any real growth.
good,"Company is focused on Lean Six Sigma practices, productive and other manufacturing practices. There is room to advance in a fast paced environment.  The company has gone through six layoffs in the past couple years as it continues to acquire more company's and facilities. In addition turnover rate is very high. There is a strong focus on quality and sustainability across the globe."
good,"Es una empresa fuerte, bien estructurada con  muchos años de experiencia,  amplio catálogo de productos. Un día de trabajo en Stanley Black & Decker  las posiciones generan alto nivel de responsabilidad, se trabaja bajo presión  mantiene buen ambiente laboral buenos compañeros."
good,It's a decent job well-managed high energy job culture very friendly and respectful overall it's a great job it's just lack of communication between certain management team members
good,"Working there was okay in the beginning, salary wasn’t worth the role or work you were given. No room for advancement within the finance group, management was mediocre, everything changed when it switched over to Stanley black and decker"
good,"The parent company closed our center and provided exactly one opening at another to apply for. Some folks with 15 + years were simply let go. Severance package was completely dependent upon receiving unemployment benefits, so those who got another position somewhere else were left without any compensation for years of service."
good,"SBD started the Digital Accelerator as a startup inside the company to lead them into a digital future.  After three years, they have lost most of their best people because those people were on projects taken over by the other business units and subsequently cancelled."
good,"(Corporate headquarters at SBD -Stanley Black and Decker overview only):  "
good,Fair place to work management doesn't care about you they make a good show of it but when if gets down to it they don't was going to be fulltime fired
good,"For the most part, was a decent company. The culture and technology is outdated to say the least. There is also an implicit cut-throat culture that lingers."
good,"Aprendí todo lo que involucra al Departamento de Marketing Digital, redacción sobre los productos de comercialización de los diferentes Product Manager, contacto con agencias de publicidad, envíos de mailing, control y actualización en la redes sociales."
good,Not the place it once was to work. Used to feel like working with family but with the take over by Stanley and new management it has changed but not for the better. Can be micro managed but when the manager works from a different office this can be difficult when trying to explain situations over the phone and then your opinion doesn't count.
good,poor management no people who care about family good pay good jobs overall good workers but management shady and lacks compassion and character not loyal.
good,Stanley Black & Decker was a great place to learn from your mistakes. Management was stressful at times but wanted you to learn. Ask questions and take notes because it will certainly benefit you!
good,"Fun laid back people are easy to get along with. Easy tasks were given, but job as to be done in a timely manner. Over all great management and slow-paced."
good,"Good hourly wage and plenty of overtime, low stress though a fast paced workplace, friendly coworkers and very clean work environment, free lunches once a week"
good,It's a good place to work but there is a lot of drama and it's very fast pace. You have to have thick skin to work there and you haven't to not get offended easily.
good,Ambiente lavorativo che metteva alla prova le capacità di gestione dello stress. Contesto dinamico in cui era richiesta flessibilità ed elevata capacità di adattamento.
good,"Based on a typical day at Stanley, we get about 80-100 emails a day. It is a very high paced environment, we deal with a multitude of vendors and subcontractors on a daily basis."
good,"Als trainer veel nieuwe mensen opleiden,anders gewoon werken als orderpicker."
good,"Good company, although there is no work life balance, very demanding and less training. Compensation is higher then other fortune company but health benefits is not that great."
good,"Solid company with good benefits and decent pay."
good,"Coworkers were super talented, but the restructure ruined what we had going. New management was unwilling or unable to change. I left the company and have since been much happier."
good,"There was no such thing as a typical day at SBD, things were constantly changing. Management was overall rather cold, my direct manager was great but above him you're no more than a number."
good,"I enjoyed my day to day activities and the interactions with the customers and clients.  The work of designing and installing access control, cctv and alarm systems was interesting and stimulating.  I enjoyed completing projects on time and under budget.  My co-workers were supportive and professional.  We worked as a team to drive projects to completion."
good,its a clean place to work.the people tran very well and they make you understand your job. the people are really nice as well
good,"The culture depends which facility you work at. At some of the plants,the culture can be pretty negative. At others, the people are really nice. Typically get the response ""that is not my job"" and they are resistant to change. However, I have met some really great people. In corporate, be sure to start in the field or department you really want to work for. Even though it is a huge company and lots of opportunities, the transition between department is not very seamless and more often than not will not let you transfer."
good,"You are expected to be on-call 24x7x365. Even with a rotation schedule, you were still expected to assist other staff if contacted on your non-on-call times."
good,"Productive, fast pace environment. Friendly Co-Workers, unloading 3 ovens into 40 lb totes, working in extreme heat at times. Weighing and packaging parts for shipping. Omni Lube parts and package for shipping."
good,"as a line leader i inspected the packaging of the drill bits and pulled the parts needed for packing on the line."
good,"Good people to work with.  Good transportation and compliance department at Stanley corp.  CRC very weak in this area. "
good,"They have many site locations, but most are concentrated in the north east, so if you are not open for relocation to that region it makes promotion opportunities difficult.  They also have high expectations for work demands and most of the people in the higher level salaried positions work very long hours (myself included) with a bad work/life balance.  However, the pay is good and the benefits are very competitive."
good,"loading and unloading trucks, replenishing line, putting away inbound materials, build orders and palletize materials, deal with pink slips and truck drivers to make sure that the orders are correct. Dealing with DM and WMS inventory  control systems. dealing with roofing and home siding materials also dealing with raw wood. meeting productions that was needed to be met on certain dates and time periods."
good,"Ricco back ground tecnico dell'azienda, nonostante il periodo di contrazione dei volumi è stato ancora possibile imparare dall'esperienza di tanti colleghi e dal rapporto quotidiano con la fabbrica."
good,The comoany was purchased be a larger company and many lost their jobs in process. Since my departure the company has released all employees from their jobs.
good,I would recommend this job to anyone that is looking for a good working environment and the opportunity to learn more about tools it is a very knowledgeable experience
good,I liked the positions I was into. And mostly got along with everyone.  Worked on the line in a certain position in order of assembly . About 10 to 15 people on place in line
good,Overall Stanley Black and Decker is good place to work for. I just had a problem with not knowing when I get off.  My fingers tips hurt from pushing wires.
good,Very large company with great culture. They have frequent change at the top of their leadership departments. They have great training courses available to employees.
good,Fast paced work place. Safety is key go all who work there. Training was helpful and line leads where great at answering questions. All materials were with in hands reach of each station
good,"Lacking in communication and planning by management, coworkers are friendly and helpful.I learned a lot towards honing my maintenance and leadership skills"
good,You were on a line that's usually short on help. You multiple jobs at a fast pace.  Need better way to train once your put on the floor. You don't really have any breaks. They're over in 10 minutes except lunch which is 30.
good,entreprise avec énormément de Securiter l'organisation pas terrible
good,"It felt like that political matters took more of a precedence over the actual work and the running of the company.  If they had only minded their P's and Q's and left the political stuff alone...  Politics has no place in business."
good,"Too many chiefs, not enough indians. Overall I can dig the teamwork environment in my department but I prefer to work alone, unsupervised, left to my tasks and entrusted to get my work done. Sanity maintenance."
good,O maior problema estava na gestão e critérios de avaliação.
good,"Fast pace, result driven company. Multi-national culture that gives you the opportunity to work with various people and learn new things on a daily base."
good,The Supervisor and employees were nice and kind and respectful. Work was clean and nice environment. Hardest part of the job was you have to stand up all day and you only get one twenty minute break the whole day.
good,My time at Stanley was great. The company had lots of great tools to get your job done. There was a lack of culture for employees (>1 year less) who were not in the SLP program.
good,"Has 1st, 2nd, & 3rd shifts available.  Hands on, picking and packing, shipping and receiving,  forklift experience, replenishment, packing orders, heavy lifting. No group work."
good,"Not bad work. Pay too low. no real advancment."
good,"Days are extremely repetitive.  With the heavy shuffle of management over the past few years, the division of employee and management has increased.  office entry level is below average, if joining the union workers only join if you intend on doing the same job with the company for many years to come.  No room to grow with levels of seniority not moving for many years to come.  "
good,The company is fine to work for.  Tasks are required & completed on a timely basis.  More benefits would be great. My team is great.  Working 3rd shift is the hardest part.
good,"I worked here a long time ago.  And all I remember, is I had to leave because I needed more money. I wish I could say more but to be honest, I don't know"
good,"Es una empresa que paga muy bien, pero debido a no lograr las metas en los ultimos años, rota mucho el personal. Se trabaja bajo demasiada presion para alcanzar esas metas."
good,"Very fast paced environment in a warehouse setting ,picking ups and customer orders to conveyor belt and maintaining a safe work environment ,housekeeping duties"
good,It's a very great place to work at I have enjoyed beening there. I also enjoyed making tools for other companies. I liked the hours they were giving me
good,They were terrible at scheduling i had about 12 different hour changes in under a year.  However management was good dealing with day to day and benefits are amazing.
good,"The hr team do not care about nothing, they do not try to work with you. My lead was sweet and it’s nice people that you work with. I recommend to stay to yourself while working there."
good,"Stanley Black and Decker was a great entry job, but no room for advancement."
good,"Was a fast paced work zone ,do what you can and get it done , 3 breaks 2 15 min and 1 30 min break . If my situation would've have turned the way it did I never would've left."
good,"Driving revenue is the top priority.  Management is not always working out of the same office as you are, but they do make themselves available when needed."
good,"everyone is fun to work with all friendly, good training , great pay, good discount, the only downside is some supervisors dont worry about their employees"
good,"Laid back work culture but still focused on results. My manager and colleagues were very helpful in helping me adjust to SBD."
good,"Need to know all by your self the process of your title, its hard but i enjoy it and i learn more things on my field. i skip my break just to focus on my work. i enjoy also benefits of this company."
good,I would go in at 8pm go to my line am we would do a little exercisers before we start then our team leader would tell us where we would be. We would switch spots three different times through out the shift so we wont get tired quick
good,An American household brand that offers opportunity to connect with business customers and consumers alike. Good place to work for those who desire to remain on the East Coast.
good,"always learn something new, keeps you busy. the people are helpful and want you to excel. Very friendly and dedicated employees. you will like this place"
good,"Easy work, air conditioned, can sit while working, work was mostly 10 hour days sometimes 12. Always off on Sunday. Coworkers are friendly and helpful."
good,Its not a life changing job but it is steady work. The job security is good however the pay scale leaves much to be desired. good people. good job. you just may need a way to supplement your income.
good,"I doubt I will find a company as great as SBD in the future when it comes to benefits, however my manager was promoted too quickly and was lacking the skills to manage people well. The company culture is also not very collaborative, so one often feels on an island."
good,Not a very good place to work. Too many hours and there is no accountability. 10 hour days mandatory and usually you have to work on the weekend. Would not recommend.
good,"I consider SBD a difficult place to work. Many of the people there are wonderful people to work with, and I have the utmost respect for them, but the Stanley culture is cut-throat. I consider the company as users. They bring you on, use you to create processes that will eliminate their need of you, then they toss you away like yesterday's recycling. At the corporate level, they have no concept of loyalty. They expect if from their employee's but they do not know how to give it to their employees's"
good,"A typical day for me is from 8:00 to 4:30 five days a week with "
good,"Committed to excellence, ambitious and hardworking"
good,"it was just to fare from my home. and with the gas priceses and the camute, the pay was just not enough. it was a good job if i lived closer. i probly would have stayed longer."
good,"Good learning platforms for understanding the real market activities"
good,Trying to leave the job site because they dont pay us that well and sometimes it can be stressful here and sometimes they want us to over work ourselves
good,"Busy, busy, busy.... everyday is a challenge. If you like challenges then this place is for you. Unfortunately I have other goals in my life I need to pursue. The Job here has been very rewarding so far. I could say Job security is a definite upside to this employment found here."
good,"I was a temp when I worked here, while I was finishing college. It was a well paying job, it was not in my profession."
good,"Was not there long enough to experience long-term benefits of being a black & decker employee, but it was a nice experience while I was there. Good experience at the health fair."
good,Solid company. Strong initiatives for continual improvement. Drive to innovate. If you are driven to work for a solid company and are a strong contributor you with thrive.
good,"For IT-Testing in India don't have much growth, and I dont see any scope to be in this see a good vertical growth in my stream. rest all it good. I think it should bring more policies and  ideas to grow and make it possible as multinational organization."
good,This is a stable company.  The benefits are great.  The salary is acceptable.  Most of the departments are growing.  It's not a bad place to work.  They do prefer a degree.
good,"Customer Service"
good,"empresa que tiene un gran ambiente laboral, el cual se basa en la confianza entre sus colaboradores"
good,"Ms.Sandra was a horrible line lead. Treated everyone like complete garbage , even made another grown woman cry. treated us like literal slaves, made us clean on hands and knees with no disregard to age or disability. Did whatever it took to get people fired."
good,"Gestione del gruppo di customer service, tier 1 e 2 e ruolo primario nella creazione di processi e procedure aziendali."
good,"Answer phone calls, data entry, work cases, enter orders, enter quotes, take orders over the phone, respond to emails, understand the customer base, build professional relationships"
good,"I worked here for three months. Apart from the management, The staff were great and helpful. If it weren't for the managment then I would definitely recommend anyone to apply there. I learned a lot being a product specialist dealing with customers as well as learning different systems such as SAP to view stocks and cash out customers."

good,"This was  a good place to work, but the work was hard. We were well appreciated at times depending on the management around you. I would recommend this company to those who are looking for assembly."
good,Work day was 8 hours. I ran several machines at one time.  I learned a lot from my  coworkers. Some days it could be vary oily. Got to run CNC machines when there were parts to run on them. supervisors were easy to get along with
good,Very hands on experience and a lot of job responsibilities to help foster individual growth. Co-workers are friendly and the company has occasional special events.
good,The employees are approachable and easy to work with. The company has been in business for a very long time which allows for a sense of stability in your job. This company offers great benefis and ample vacation time.

good,"Azienda multinazionale guidata da HQ molto presente, dotata di sistemi informativi e contabili avanzati, struttura efficiente e snella, attenta alle necessità dei clienti, poco propensa a premiare il merito"
good,"Stanley Black and Decker has some of the best employees in the business.  Most people are there because the believe in the products the company makes, and devote themselves to making them better.  However, upper management need to change their current methods of squashing employee morale and diminishing the core brand values in order to make the company better in the long-run."
good,Have got good exposure of various areas/regions during my tenure of 5 years. This company teaches you to perform in varios tough situations. Management is good and takes care of knowledge inhancement of employees through training and online education.
good,"re-structures regularly, and if you haven't proven your worth in 6 months, then your likely to be let go. Didn't enjoy my time at all"
good,"Highly political environment, no advancement opportunities. Mostly Contract employees and temporary assignments that would be extended depending on work load."
good,Did not work with them long enough. people was nice and lay back. the hardest part of the job for me was learning the stand up forklift so i could become a picker. The most enjoyable part of the job is that i knew a out people that work their so i was not too shy
good,Move product from one location to another with a Raymond reach truck or a cherry picker. When the lead wasn't there I would be the backup lead.
good,"I have learned a lot about how to help people."
good,"acudia a recibir turno y por menores en las celulas verificaba el programa de produccion y programaba los materiales a utilizar"
good,A company that had periodic and regular corporate and division information sessions between management and staff.  Annual confidential performance review between staff and management with open input and dialogue.  Health and safety of staff is key.  Staff work together as teams of friends supporting each other for the success of projects.
good,typcial work day was fast pace..learned to be fast pasted. mangement was ok and helpful. Hard part about the job was they did not give you time to learn the fast past and expected you to be fast past in one night. Hardest part was to keep up..most enjoyable part was breaks
good,"Great place for a young professional to begin career. The company is looking toward expanding global growth, so there are many opportunities available."

good,"Great learning experiences and great people"
good,Tremendous potential to be more than number 3 in the market place
good,"Stanley  Black & Decker I have gained a great deal of experience both working with my subordinates and management.  Pride in my dependability and flexibility to work other areas of the receiving department , ability to communicate, analyze and resolve potential problems at hand.  While maintain high personal standards for safety, security and productivity."
good,I worked at B&D for 25 years.  I enjoyed working there and was sad to leave.
good,"I loved my co workers. They were the best part of my job. I was just a temp. You never knew if you were going to be coming into work, just for them to tell you to go back home because they didn't have enough for you to do. Half of my time was spent cleaning the place, becuase they didn't have enough work for us. The management was horrible! I have to say, I've never worked somewhere that had management that screamed at their employee's so much. It was crazy. It made you nervous, wondering if they were going to scream at you next! The pay was decent though, especially if you got overtime."
good,"Its been a long time since I worked here, I think the plant is no closed."
good,I assembled Black & Decker tools on an assembly line.My co-workers were great people to work with.
good,Empresa onde obtive a oportunidade de fazer cursos e treinamentos para meu desenvolvimento profissional.
good,Helpful and extremely friendly co-workers
good,A typical day was steady and I learned alot from this job. The management and co-work were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was knowing they wasn't going to hire you and most enjoyable part of the job was new opportunties.
good,Empresa a qual você possui um grande crescimento profissional.
good,The job itself was doable and easy.  One of the major downsides was the lack of communication between workers. It is a fast paced job and made the day go by faster.
good,Stanley is a production work lots of hours to work.. really bad safety personal great benefits but supervisor doesn't care about employee need to work Saturday mandatory all year
good,"Within your shift, you must achieve a minimal goal of assembly production. Must have an eye for detail and proficiency as a assembler working with a variety of door panels."
good,Its have its up and down moments the good you meet good people but the work ethic could be better......... For what you doing the should be a little better
good,"Bonne ambiance par secteur "
good,"Learned a great deal while at Stanley, Worked with a great team of experienced individuals who took pride in their work. Widely accepted, universal brand."
good,"Work experience varies greatly depending on which area you are working in. Not much team work. "
good,"The overall atmosphere at Stanley is pretty up tempo to say the least. It's all about putting numbers on the board and getting product out of the door, at the expense of working employees to the point of leaving mid shift. I personally have had 4 days off last month and a scheduled 2 days off this month of October, 2018. I need a job that doesn't force me into overtime at the cost of losing said job, and I feel for the mothers and fathers that work with me who have had even less days off with no time for their families. The pay is nice, benefits are great, and it truly is not a bad place to work. Besides the fact that i have had irregular sleep for the past year and a half, it's time for a change."
good,If you're a millennial then you might not like the culture here. There is a shortage on resources but the expectation is still consistent with limited coverage.
good,The experience here gave me an opportunity to explore new skill sets on channel management. It also allowed me to set-up service network across India for the power tools range and develop planning tool for spares stock planning to ensure anytime availability.
good,"It's a great place to work at, some jobs can get stressful but I feel like it all depends on the type of boss you have, the attitude you get does effect your entire work day."
good,Empresa agradável de trabalhar aonde obtive aprendizados profissionais.
good,Work life balance can be obtained however training and onboarding can be very spotty. You will have to learn on your own at some point however training could be way better.
good,"The potential to make money is there, but its will come with sacrifices and patience. Management is spread too thin to care for all employees and their development. Expectations are also very high from day one."
good,"They should hire on quicker. More pay and chances to move up. The temps don’t have as many perks as permanent people. It’s a job, we all need that these days."
good,"Fast paced and good CO workers but they will lay you off without any warning. One minute youh are leading employees, exceeding production and quality goals, and the next you are walked to HR to have your badge turned in."
good,"Working in the Finance/Controllership at a plant is good experience, but an individual in this functional area hired below the position of Controller will find it difficult to advance in position without first relocating to either the division or corporate headquarters for an extended period of time.  The culture within this functionality does not emphasize employee development outside the corporate circle."
good,I'd prefer this place rather than any fast food restaurant. If your 18 it's a good place to start gaining experience on what a full-time job is like. There second most priority is safety so operating a forklift or a sit down is easy to learn here.
good,"great pay not diversified , management has experience but lack multi tasking. Community does not work with eachother. Job is excellent , great pay and very clean as well as organized."
good,"Aggressive work environment with many opportunities.  Workload is not always realistic given time, resources, and scope.  Therefore, the work/life balance suffers."
good,"The company in general offers on par compensation and benefits.  Over the years it has grown to be so larger, people are becoming more of just a number rather than individuals being recognized for making a solid contribution.  Unfortunately it seemed that the incompetent ones somehow got to the upper management positions and the ones that perform seem to stay in the same position."
good,"Company doesn't go a good job at clearly defining organizational goals and expectations. Very quarterly driven so you know what the quarter's profit goals are, but how the leadership team wants to work to get to those goals are vague at best and when asked about the goals, leadership asks you to provide your own goals."
good,"A usual day usually consist of being assigned a trailer to unload, you wrap your plastic sheet to cover to top of product when finished and plastic wrap to secure the product. we receive information on the product in the trailer as to the number of sku's and total number of cases. Usually with a two man team you unload truck by placing product on pallets throwing the sheet on top a wrapping it. you then take pallet jack and move pallet to a specified line in the warehouse so the forklift drivers can retrieve it. i learned a few things about communication, focus, dedication, and being efficient is necessary for both your partner and you to have because it is beneficial  to you both plus the company if you work at a steady fast pace. Its nice when you supervisors and such understand your importance and how hard the job can be. The hardest part is making sure you dont mix any product (sku's).  The most enjoyable part is having a partner with a work ethic and understanding of time management equivalent to yours seeings as we dont always work with the same person or persons."
good,"Organized and prioritized safety, team of 15 or more associates. Managed cycle time, productivity working closely with stocking, order filling and receiving."
good,Its a busywork environment for me because I can usually catch on to a job quick so me lead uses me on multiple job tasks. Over the years I've learned that most companies don't care about the employees its all about what they can ship out to get money in.
good,Diamond Staffing is a great staffing Agency. they found me a great job in production
good,Worked in a few different positions within the company...when the company was Black & Decker (prior to the merger with Stanley Works) it was an awesome company to work for...after the merger things seem to have went downhill from there
good,The Production Supervisor( Brendon Campau) and the Team Leads (Benba Kaye and Robbie Scates) from the weekend shift are awesome to work for they motivate you to work hard because you can always bet that you will get some type of praise or recoginition. they make working there 12 hours in steel toe boots fun.
good,Fun and productive place to work an learn new skills if you're willing to learn... Nice people and companyto workfor I can't fid nothing bad to say about this company.......
good,"I loved arriving at work early and this gave me the opportunity to organize myself for any work related issues. As a forklift driver, my responsibility was to keep  my internal customers supplied with components. Communication was very important. The best part of the day was knowing I had completed my job assignment 100% to the best of my ability."
good,"Key and lock production was a typical day at Stanley. The knowledge of how keys and locks work is invaluable. The job itself can become very tedious. Good management but unstable, had 2 managers in a year and a half period. Great employees that really make you feel like family."
good,Had a lot of growth opportunity and friendly environment at work.
good,High quality products with very loyal clients.
good,Breaks were way too short and the pay does not match up with how they want you to produce on the line. The management does not really seek to make the conditions for the their line workers better. The time that you work is great though and that you get paid every week was decent.
good,"organisation instable, réorganisations trop fréquentes"
good,Great company to work for that owns some of the biggest tool brands in the world. Lots of room for advancement and trying different jobs. Overall pay for each position is lower than the national averages. Runs lean and sometimes creates more work for each employee.
good,"Great pay for the job duties given they MAX you out at 17.65 ,each year you get a cost of living raise. Great coworkers ,great 3rd shift shipping lead ( jack ) besides that the job sucks! Management goes by favoritism, they want you to kiss there butt basically! If management was a solid 10 , then it would be a GREAT Place to work!"
good,"I started when it was newly formed. I assisted in placing 20ft racks up for product Also, set-up reconditioning tables for technicians to referbish return products. Operated forklift. Weighed pallets."
good,"Is a good company to work in, Management is great, good company to learn as a good first-class factory and good processes. Still some opportunity to improve on Teamwork area and impove hiring process for new personnel, people with better attitude and collaboration with the workmates at all levels."
good,It is a good place to work although some items are too heavy. There are some areas in the workplace where you have to get dirty when you do picking in that area.
good,"Stanley Black & Decker was the 1st MNC to work with. "
good,"With many departments and teams working together, communication was sometimes lost or delayed. This sometimes made completing projects a hassle. Alternatively, the communal environment made for a comfortable and welcoming workplace."
good,Great company to work for however the opportunities to grow are limited once you reach top management. The pay scales are very nice and there are some great benefits. HR is absolutely useless. don't expect a decision in your favor if you have a conflict with someone higher than you.
good,"Fast paced,on line some days others changing parts in an out of ovens ."
good,"Was a good place to work during the day."
good,"Found  very dissimilar and not well planed environment. Where we migrate 100+ remote sites from PRI to Acme SIP trunk."
good,"Très bonne entreprise "
good,"Busy, busy, busy.... everyday is a challenge. If you like challenges then this place is for you. Unfortunately I have other goals in my life I need to pursue. The Job here has been very rewarding so far. I could say Job security is a definite upside to this employment found here."
good,"The good out weighed the bad, making production in meeting company goals wasnt hard at all. Long as you came in to do your work in go home than nobody bothered you."
good,"I typically get to work early and check office emails and then have meeting with 1st shift supervisor. Then I check work load for the day,"
good,"Metodologia americana focada em resultados, métricas financeiras agressivas."
good,"The customers are great, High turnover in management . Work/life balance depended upon the manager at the time. The managers liked to make up their own ""policies""."
good,"Very high turn around in management can be frustrating, and business is cyclic.  Very good product lines to keep your interest - wide variety of job opportunities available."
good,"1)Management is Friendly and regularly motivating"
good,"I worked 8 hours a day,I picked product as needed from a rf scanner as needed.Management I thought was fair to a point. My co-workers were a pleasure to work with.  The hardest part of the job was to pick product in a timely manner as to reach your quota per hour.The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a physical environment."
good,"This company is best for experienced developers that are looking for more freedom at work. The best part of this job was working remotely 1-3 days a week. This is not the best environment for a junior level or entry level engineer since there is little to no structure to nourish you into a roll of increased responsibilities. You work with mostly off-shore contractors that work in a different timezones and have little to no interest in helping you improve or answering questions if you are new. "
good,It is just your typical job. Management was great. It was coworkers who act like 2 years old when they cant get their way that made this place uncomfortable to work in .
good,Good place to work. Lots of stuff to do and not enough people to do it. HR doesn't respond in a quick manner and rooms for advancement are not great on some levels.
good,I'm a father of 2. I got to pay for school and the roof over our heads and SBD isn't paying enough.. Also they knocked us back to 35 hours.. somethings got to give....
good,Work experience can vary greatly depending on which unit you work for and at which location. Sales and operations jobs are great. Support services like HR and IT not so much.
good,"Had the opportunity to be trained on industrial equipment."
good,It is a ok place to work I just want to expand my options and a new career. The breaks are short really don't have time to eat your food and one of the breaks you have to wait about four hour before you go to break other than that its ok
good,"A typical day at work is long, busy, and a constantly changing environment. It's challenging but a fun and laid back atmosphere."
good,"Great place to work- BUT- know that you are a part of the financial equation to be minimized, not an assert to be invested in. Over the last 2 years we've had the best years on record, but no raises for anybody. Executive bonuses were very generous however. "
good,"It was a great to work for until it was brought out by Stanley, it should have been a top ten Fortune 500 company to work for. Unfortunately, in 2010 after the purchase the family-oriented feel, went out the window with the new shareholders. Everything became about the bottom line and making the shareholders happy. The bottom line is very important in any business, but at what cost and who will be sacrificed. Many mid-level and lower levels territory managers was sacrificed while corp. higher level management was moved around or given a golden parachute for a safe landing.."
good,"There is a team  that work hand in hand, from being materials in the building, to processing them, to assembling, packing and shipping them out to end users. They are always there, and glad to pick up slack if someone is tied up with other task."
good,Overall it is a good place to work. Sometimes they choose the favorites though. The hours are nice and the work is easy. Most of the people are friendly.
good,I fixed pallets with hammer nails and new boards. Pallets that couldn't be fixed went on to empty truck. Used forklift to get empty pallets of mod levels. Great learning experience from the company.
good,I did not get a chance to really see what the company was all about. I really looked forward to being apart of the organization and growing. I appreciate the time there.
good,"On the job training as an intern helped guide my career but needed more work-life balance. With mergers and acquisitions, job security was always in question."
good,I liked my job but have had better jobs it was a good job in that it help me pay for college for my daughter at that time. It provided a very good source of income for my family.
good,"É uma Empresa que você não se sente só, eles estão ali presente, sempre pronto a te ouvir, ajudar e incentivar o seu trabalho."
good,"The company is solid, and they do not age discriminate. Many people have worked for them for a long time. However, some managerial practices need to be updated to keep up with the competition."
good,"thisnwas an okay job , i feel the hours are long and the pay is low . also the breaks are only two 10 min breaks with a 20 min lunch with a very hot work environment trying to work to reach goals, is a little stressful"
good,"The conditions there were less than admirable, I loved working with my coworkers, and I loved the money; but 5AM-5PM 6 days a week in 100 degree weather the whole time started to get to me. They took away some of our vacation time, and then tried to make up for it with a 2% raise. I just really started to get frustrated there."
good,Clock in at 8... Go on the floor recieve and unload packages.. Stoke them in their proper placement.. Make sure that all product is up to quality code.. Make accurate records on placement of product.. Conduct routine checks on shipments
good,I have grown the most here at the factory Stanley Black and Decker. I have grown in character and I have required leadership skills to further my career. It is a place to start your career.
good,"At B & D, you could move up in jobs title but very little compensation for the new positions. Overall it was a steady job, until the company decided to relocate. They asked employees if they wanted to move with the company but they wasn't giving a lot of compensation to help the employees relocate as well."
good,1. Check email and meeting.
good,Lo sueldos están por debajo y el ser contratado por outsource con renovación mensual no es un factor motivante.
good,Micromanaged boss that is a coffee cup manager. Spend too much time on the road. Feel like my MBA is not being utilized and I am just a home depot employee
good,This was actually a plant that makes Dewalt cordless tools.  Their only mission is to push out as many of these high priced tools as they can every day.  You stand next to a person all day and they expect you not to even talk.
good,The mangers were great but the Human resource managers were terrible. They took the words of disgruntle employees instead of doing thorough investigations before making decisions. The pay is low compared to every other plant in the community.
good,Me gusto trabajar con diversas culturas y un ambiente diferente.
good,"With the exception of ECI, which was the TEMP Agency for the Company. Made many promises to employees to be made full-time but never kept promises."
good,Stanley Black & Decker would be a great place to work if they would care a little more about their workers and their families. They work 10 hour days 6 days a week and have for over a year. They go against employees on Dr. Recommendations to help the employee do their job safely and to keep themselves healthy. On employee for instance was recommended by a Dr to wear tinted safety glasses for light sensitive eyes. They told the employee that if they had to wear them they could not stay employed with Stanley Black&Decker
good,"Empresa com grande nome e história, porém possui uma mentalidade capitalista que só visa lucro e não pensa no bem estar dos funcionários!"
good,"Work hard and get noticed. Unclear future plans for company division. Many acquired business create overlap in jobs, no guarantee of future employment long-term."
good,I love working for Stanley Black and Decker however the department that I am in is poorly micro managed and very stressful. I know the company itself is a great company to work for however based on market value you would get paid considerably less than other companies doing the same job.
good,"A typical day included many meetings and reviews of promotions and new product offerings, purchasing approvals, scheduling review and supervisory meetings."
good,Stanley Black and Decker FMDC lacks communication when it comes to certain things that go on in the warehouse and how they go about dealing with issues amongst people dissatisfies me
good,"Get the opportunity to work on awesome projects and make big decisions. Truly owning your product category. "
good,There's a lot of standing on your feet for 10 hrs. but you do get two ten minute breaks and a twenty minute lunch break. If you stay on property your breaks are paid breaks but if you leave the property they are not paid breaks.
good,"Stanley Black and Decker offers reasonably good hours and days off.  They provide benefits which is a real plus.  They strive to have a good atmosphere and address employee needs."
good,Challenging work environment. A great deal of the accounting work is being take outside of the US.  i have learned a great deal while working for Stanley Black & Decker.
good,"A very fast paced job, I learned many things related to the job, helped me to build my work skills, very little support from management, work place culture varied daily, I enjoyed my job, didn't see anything hard about it, there is a lot of turn around in this company. People start and after a month, they will quit. Is a tough place to work, but having some discipline you are able to survive on a daily basis."
good,"Nice company depends on what area of the company you are working for. Very fast pace never took lunch had to keep up with the work flow. Management don't listen well, they tend to side with employees who has been there longer."
good,"Stanley Black and Decker offers reasonably good hours and days off.  They provide benefits which is a real plus.  They strive to have a good atmosphere and address employee needs."
good,"Processed orders for mechanical door security. I learned the mechanics of exit devices, door locks, keys and cores, closures, hardware, and processing orders from a hardware schedule. Management was reactive to issues as they came up. Too many issues resulted in a Kaisen Event. Loved my co-workers, they work together as a team and willing to help/train as needed. The hardest part of the job is remembering all the details including codes, and promos available at the time. I absolutely loved the challenge of the position. It made me a better worker and enjoyed the job very much."
good,Reworked toaster that didn't work like they should. I learned how toasters work and how to build them and unbuild them. I enjoyed working with everyone there. The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet but it got better with time. Learning to rework the toaster ovens kept me busy and I had something to do all the time.
good,I worked here for 3 years then Stanley took over and laid me off with no notice. I like many people were out of the job because of corporate take over.
good,It was a good company to work for. Job was super easy  just to far for me to travel everyday . Wish it was closer in the inner city . Also the team leads need more training on the line
good,Apesar de ser um bom ambiente para se trabalhar eu acredito que  a mesma poderia melhorar em questão de uma melhor estruturação de uma cultura organizacional em prol da coletividade e empático.
good,Productive work place. Sometimes has good work pace and others it's slow. Must go through a temp agency to be hired on and work at least 1 year before being hired full time.
good,Company to big. Little company communications. Often seemed like right hand had no idea what the left hand was doing. Company was more reactive to the industry then forward thinking.
good,"So every day we’d have a meeting then we all would set of to do our job I’d go get my forklift then come back to the desk and get my task for that moment then set up my scanner  accordingly then I’d do my job."
good,"It’s a good company, but some of the managers abuse their titles and treat people unfairly. Overall the company is good the hours are reasonable and the pay is good."
good,it allowed me time to go to school and work during the weekend. the environment is fast paced but it is doable and helps make the day go by faster.                             .                                                             .
good,"Tough culture; great CEO; for a manufacturing company, operational processes and procedures are not very lean; as with any company, some senior management are not good leaders.  Dysfunctional..."
good,Some managers were good and some were idiots. The worst ones are the ones that think they know what is going on and don't. The people made that place and there were lots of fun years before they moved to Mexico and laid us all off. They did us dirty in the end.
good,"No se respeta los horarios,se trabaja de l a v pero te hacían ir sábado  se trabajaban más de 12 hs y no te efectivizan porque te tienen por agencia al igual que los 30 compañeros que trabajaban"
good,Had a good 23 years with Stanley learned a lot in those years & had some good opportunities.  Which I could have finished my last years with this company but it wasn't in the cards.
good,"- 5 day week"
good,"fast pace manufactuing shop.numbers high priority. working 8 to 10 hours working from work orders and walk in jobs. building socket dies heat treating, building socket punches heat treating and grinding. repairing parts for maintenance. very good co-workers everyone got along well."
good,"I believe that the company was more focused on their employees when I started working there in 2001. SB&D displaced thousands of workers by moving their operations to other states/countries. This company was one of the largest in RI and employed thousands of people.  By moving their operations out of RI, they displaced many workers in what is, and was, a very bad economy. I think that they should have been more focused on keeping SB&D in RI so that families and individuals that worked there for many years could have been still employed. If asked would I work there again should they come back to RI, I would have to say yes.  The benefits and the co-workers that I had were very good and we were family."
good,"La empresa se caracterizaba por tener urgentes toda la materia prima, para empezar a producir. Entonces tube que aprender a definir que era lo más urgente de todo lo urgente. Además, de ser eficaz y tratar de mantener cuestiones fuera de mi control, lo más controladas posibles."
good,"Learned the corporate culture "
good,"we'll a typical day for me at SB&D would start at 7 and end at 4:30. would love to elaborate but not here."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and my job as an electronics/ electrician. I worked second shift which was the part I least enjoyed.
good,good place to work but no job security management really good
good,"Journal entries, update all system data, Trial Balance, update employee information, filing, manage financial reporting"
good,"like my job.lot of good people to work with,im willing to lean more"
good,"Empresa boa se trabalhar, porem atualmente está em crescimento e visa a reantabilidade a qualquer custo."
good,Bon salaire mais beaucoup de pression pour obtenir les objectifs/chiffres voulu
good,"Able to work on three different projects. Assisted Engineering with several different needs ( it helped that i knew how to use hand tools). unfortunately as an intern, i was placed in a meeting room with other interns (not a lot of networking)."
good,"I find it OK to work within different packing lines and staff and supervisors were cooperative. Although i didn't like the very short breaks only 10 minutes x 2  and lunch break only 30 min.  for 12 hr work at least total  1.25 hr break should be there in divided manner like"
good,Un lugar para aprender y lograr desafíos personales y profesionales.
good,Práce v této firmě je finančně ohodnocená oproti konkurenci dobře. Avšak je zde půlhodinová přestávka. Jen ta. Při zbytku směny se člověk nezastaví ani na chvíli a funguje jako robot. Ne živý člověk.
good,It was a good job to work. Some days it was relaxed some days it was fast paced. The people who trained me did very good! I feel like I learned alot from them
good,"Great role in innovation, leading efforts on Artificial Intelligence, robotics & other emerging technologies. Then entire group got liquidated by senior leadership -- apparently 'innovation', 'the future' or 'not-being-disrupted-like-Kodak' isn't a long-term goal of the organization...."
good,"Empresa em fase de reestruturação, cultura interessante, porém em processo de modificações ainda a serem consolidadas."
good,"Brilliant company to work for, excellent skills developed. Good communication, good salary, systems training, multi skilling, support and on going training to develop new skills"
good,Stanley is a big company which can be good and bad. The Stanley name is a household name which made connecting with customers much more attainable. Service is a little tricky to navigate.
good,"Corporate drives the business extremely hard and does not listen when you tell them about manufacturing constraints, they just keep pushing. overall though its a good place to work for if you have the correct manager."
good,I enjoyed work here company was not fair to many of us by moving away but over all it was a good place to work. I would work here again if offered a job.
good,"Lack of experience in Management,  great pay thou, company lacks communication to employees, excessive gossip, training is not great, go thru temp service then not knowing when u would be hired. do your job and go home.."

good,"A great company to work for, I have just joined them for the last couple of months from Newell Brands and enjoying every moment. Am so glad to make the decision to stay with the Tools industry and continue with SBD."
good,This workplace does not have a great professional atmosphere but it is a good place to work at if you go to school. The pay is not so fair for what you do. But it is a good place to start.
good,I spent 6 months on a temp (contract assignment ) I learned a ton of things ... I had hoped that the position would go full time .. however the employee eventually came back from an extended medical leave

I moved to the injection molding department as a material handler and molding machine operator, then through testing I was promoted to set-up tech, doing all mold setting, processing and troubleshooting for my bank of ten machines during a 12 hour shift.  I was responsible for continuously meeting quality and efficiency standards for the products running in my bank of machines."
good,The work place there is anything but good. The staff there do not try and work with you on anything . I did not enjoy my short period of time there. I lost this job due to an illness and they just didn't care !
good,For me it was ok to work there.  When you relocate for Upstate NY you be looking for a fast pace job.  It had  procedures and guide lines to follow.  A lot of the principles i adhere to cause that kind of climate I was from
good,"seasonal job, enjoyed working with the seasonal staff. learned a lot more about warehouse jobs. hardest part was working night shifts."
good,Everyone is there to help each other to get the job done. There is good communication with employees and management. Teamwork is what helps the productivity.
good,"Company had major brands with important relationships with major retailers. Also had strong internal processes tied to cross team alignment on goals & objectives tied to budget. I was empowered to acquire a competitor that made us prime in the largest category in the Power Tool Accessory market which led to major growth & profit. All details of major strategic growth, diversification & profit growth are in resume."
good,Job primarily focused on power tool repair and customer satisfaction. All aspects of parts distribution apply. New and innovative products are a constant with this company. Management is fair and second to none. Team atmosphere non competitive. Having happy customers is most rewarding part of job.
good,"as the great place that is to work and organized, their discipline is excellent, manager are very demanding but offer you help to succeed at any task assigned. The benefits are excellent and you will always have equipment to accomplish any job."
good,"Very strict and heavily enforced company rules/guidelines. A typical Day consisted of setting up and running of Vertical Mills.  Typically loading steel coils with weights varying between 60 to 250 LBS. Work day divided into 3 parts (by buzzer) 7-9am, a ten minute break, 9:10 - 11:30am, lunch(30 minutes), 12-2:10pm, ten minute break 2:20-3:30 finish.  Management was very strict. no sitting, no food or drink on floor ,no personal devices, etc. My co-workers for the most part were good hard working people. Some of the physical exsertion day after day was taxing, especially during peak periods.(I personally worked 358 days straight at one pont of my tenure.) The christmas parties were the highlight of the year for me."
good,Highly qualified company to perform virtually all aspects of security integrations.  Capable of both physical and electronic security products and services.
good,"I would start my day with a nice cup off coffee, and show up for work around 6:00am sometimes even earlier. If I am early, I would wait in the eating room and drink my coffee. When my shift starts, I would then goto the back of the warehouse, and see how many trucks we had to unload for the day. We would then start unloading products off of the trucks and stacking them on skids. My co-workers were all friendly people and it made the days go by quicker. The hardest part of the job, would be when you were at the back of the truck it would get really hot. The most enjoyable part would be that we could listen to the radio while we unloaded the trucks and that would also make the days go by quicker."
good,"Aprendi muito trabalhando na Stanley, pude colocar em prática tudo o que aprendi na faculdade e na faculdade pude colocar em prática o que aprendi na Stanley. "
good,It was a GREAT job...if it werent for company downsizing...I WOULD STILL BE THERE...It was a GREAT POSITION and great people I worked with...still in touch with several of former coworkers & managers
good,"Working here was also a fun place of empolyment. All co-workers got along with each other, as well as the managers. Most days werent hard but if one was to appear it would make the day drag a little but still be bearable."
good,Buena empresa para iniciar tu vida laboral. enfocada todo el tiempo hacia la seguridad y la mejora continua de su personal.
good,Never a slow day.Time always went fast because I always kept busy. The management was very welcoming and willing to teach. My co-workers made it easy to be there as well. The hardest part of the job was finding the mistakes and making sure they got corrected before shipping the product. The most enjoyabe part of the job was working as a team and everyone was personable.
good,World class workforce with management that seemed in tune.
good,"A gerência deixa a desejar, mas o ambiente de trabalho é muito agradável, colegas sempre unidos e dispostos a ajudar."

good,The pay is decent and management is tolerable but company lacks opportunities for advancement.
good,"Good work environment, safe and friendly. I processed power tool, paperwork and kept my area clean at all times. I had to meet a quota everyday."
good,"Before the merger with Stanley, Black and Decker had a move forward spirit with tons of personal interaction between management and its field personnel. They are now a numbers driven, management top heavy company that changes sales strategies and management on the fly. At times no one knows who does what and who is in charge. There is a distinct lack of trust of management and quite the division! My co-workers are excellent! They are the grunts of the company on the ground making the sales! I enjoy the freedom of making my own schedule and setting my own hours(mostly). There are now mandatory 6 day work weeks with no over time(work half days). Cost analyst and accountants dictate how the business moves. Cost cutting and outsourcing has created a larger divide. Newly graduated college students are frequently used up until they move on and use the company as a resume builder. Very little longevity in management."
good,"I handle an average 130 incoming call per day, consistently surpassing the set 110 required. I had worked closely with customers in the past, but learned quickly that having a very open and positive attitude is extremely helpful when working with a high volume of customers. My co-workers are professional, easy to work with and fun. I enjoy what I do very much, there is not much that I consider hard. I enjoy getting an upset customer satisfied with the service they received and laughing once I have completed the call."
good,"A typical day for me at Stanley Black and Decker consist of first article inspections and sign off's, daily floor audtis and various chemical testing in a lab enviorment."
good,Great staff very friendly
good,"• Responsible for accurately picking, receiving, variety household and hand tool items."
good,"Typical day consistent of responding to customers request over the phone, email, and USPS mail. Black & Decker was very good about training all of us on the product we were supporting. We used Salesforce to track customers and product issues. My coworkers were fun and happy people. The hardest part of the job was that there was no time for training which was required in order to move up the ladder. The most enjoyable part was hearing the cusotmer say thank you and accomplishing the customers requirement."
good,Black and Decker was a great company to work for.
good,This is a company that make people do job easily. It keep people safe to work in different areas.i have learned to get parts together done on line.My co-workers cooperate with me and others very good.
good,"Environnement de travail challenging dans une entreprise en constante mutation."
good,"We were aquired by SBD, during the intergration they didnt talk to us much if at all about how safe our current positions were. They kept saying they would make us offers but after more than 7 months, nothing has been offered. Very Frustrating"
good,"This is a good job for anyone looking for a job to challenge them mentally and physically, not for the weak. Employees and staff and helpful but will pressure you to work at maximum capability."
good,The company is constantly growing which provides career opportunities.  They understand the tool industry and what it takes to be successful.  The teams work hard to do what it takes to get the job done.
good,"Fast paced work, don't sign on if you can't handle heat, constant movement, or dust.  Stay hydrated and don't sweat the small stuff. Machines go down, or operators sometimes don't hit rate."
good,"I've learned a lot working SBD, they expect you to hit your numbers every year and above, I have done this throughout my career"
good,Great brand recognition and social responsibility commitments among its employees.  Stanley B&D leadership promotes a culture of pride and inclusions.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Stanley Black & Decker, however the pay was not good for the expected work and stress. Management was very fair and nice and the workplace culture was good."
good,Making in bound and out bound calls daily and helping clients make sure their accounts are in good standing. I enjoy learning and working with other staffs.
good,"Après avoir été effectuer une mission d’interim De 16 mois au sein du bureau d’etudes, j’en tire une très bonne expérience et un bon souvenir avec l’ensemble du personnel, à refaire sans hésiter !"
good,"Some days were much more stressful than others, but almost everyone got along well. For the amount of stress we were under, most people were relatively respectful and calm."
good,"look I got thrown to the wolves and it was sink or swim from the start. It sicked it really stunted my growth and my heart to win for them. But I tried, i loved my job and people and a lot of the direction they are going in. Beyond that its a very alpha driven company and it does have a lot of internal leadership issues that i disagree with."
good,"Avis favorable"
good,Una gran empresa de nivel mundial con buen ambiente laboral grandes compañeros de trabajo

good,growing company with many career opportunities. Good office conditions and additional benefits are above the avg level of Turkish market.
good,"Awesome manager, great coworkers, challenging position good benefits but low cost of living wages. No advancement without moving out of town. If it paid better I would have never left."
good,"Really liked the job.  My co-workers were very professional and helpful to answer any questions.  A real team effort to give clients an easy experience. As a contractor, I really would have liked to been hired on.  Short term contract left me wanting."
good,Great company to work for.excellent benefits.management needs improvement. Friendly employees great people to work with. Company training program needs improvement.u
good,Its a busy production conscious environment. The top management careless of the mid and lower well-being. The working conditions and workplace climate is okay.
good,I worked here for 13 month had a disagreement over pay and then had a fone call to say they were Terminateing my contract AVOID working for these people
good,Tout est bien malgré qu'ils ont déménagé le service client en Ontario.
good,was a good job to work at but after being there so long i never got a raise  the peple where all some to work with and the pay was OK
good,"Basically to put it simple, I'm not suppose to be here. I know to much about computers to sit in a factory. I feel like i'm stuck with no opportunity's working as a temp."
good,"While I enjoy working here, I feel I cannot give a five star rating due to my personal beliefs.  I believe that every company should strive to be better on a daily basis.  If you are already at the top, you tend to not want to go any further. As with any company, it has weaknesses, but the good outweighs those.  They strive to become better and continue to improve each year.  A great place to work. My day mainly consist of tracking inventory and resolving  issues with overages/shortages.  I have learned that certain things take a little more thought and consideration than other in order to resolve correctly.  Management has been very supportive of me and my suggestions over the years I have been employed.  I have a great repore with all my co-workers, and enjoy helping them when I can.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to resolve all the issues as quickly as I would like due to other people taking extra time.  I love the sense of urgency that I need in order to get the job done.  It makes the job more rewarding to look back and see where you have been."
good,"A good mix of people, training was provided and learned a lot.  Busy environment.  The only problem with this company is stayed on too long on a temporary assignment, no benefits, pay was low scale and work load was very challenging at times."
good,"Total change of what I used to do. From stationary, furniture and computer, I shift to Cosmetics and Wood."
good,"bueno teniamos la tipica precion de trabajo en donde se trabaja en base de metas diarias y mensuales, aprendi un poco mas en los temas de los despachos, inventarios y ventas."
good,"SBD is a company where if you are in the right position, you get excellent exposure as to how big time business is run.  With proven competency, a person has the ability to advance up the ranks to manager level quickly."
good,"Pela pouca carga horária como menor aprendiz, fiquei encarregado de tarefas simples e manuais como atender os fornecedores para a entrada de mercadorias na empresa e a organização de notas fiscais para enviar para o setor responsável."
good,This was a main learning supervisor's role which help me in alot of different area's in relating to customer's and what the actual demands were.
good,"Good place to work overall, it can be stressful at times, however no job security, I feel I am just a number not a name and my job can be eliminated at any given moment, too dependent on market fluctuations."
good,"There are many smart, diligent and caring people at the organization.  Just like many big corporations, each business unit has it's own unique culture.  If you are fortunate enough to work within a strong business unit, it is possible to thrive.  "
good,It definitely is a learning experience if you're not accustomed to machinery and/or mechanics in general.  There's nothing really negative I have to say but if a person doesn't leave on a bad note and does the job....I don't understand the problem with re-hiring when you know the job and you see continuous posts for the job(s) on line.
good,"A empresa foca com exclusividade no resultado, esquece um pouco o lado humano das pessoas. São as pessoas que movem a empresa."
good,"If I received the pay for the jobs that I was doing which included training other people, I would still be there if  were not for being rear-ended in a car accident."
good,Rare to have a company where there are employees with 15-40 yrs seniority    A lot of skilled employees and variety of equipment and controls   A lot to learn
good,"I’m still on through Kelly’s services which is their temp agency, but the pay is still decent , I’m in process of trying to get hired permanent. It’s a fast paced production job! Your numbers are most important! If you don’t want to be on a line making 1500 plus products (knives,toolboxes,hammers) a night , then this isn’t the job for you! Their are no benefits or paid time off until hired on permanent."
good,"A typical day at Black and Decker  is fast-paced, laid-back, it’s a pretty enjoyable day.  The hardest part of my job was getting through security every morning.  They do a pretty thorough security check every morning which made it time-consuming.  The management team at Black & Decker  was very fair and enjoyable to work with."
good,"It was fine to work there, i have friends and family members there still working there but i moved to another state, i don't working there anymore but yeah i enjoy working there."
good,The expectation is to work a min. of 50 hrs per week with lots of after hours responsibilities.  Working with an overseas production team proved difficult to implement product changes.
good,I loved working at Stanley but they have a habit of running out of work quick.  That’s what lead me to leave because my department was shut down due to lack of work.
good,"Stanley Black and Decker is a great place to work. The work environment is friendly, and teaches you to work together as a team. The hours are long and the day is rough, but I enjoyed being an employee."
good,Great work environment with nice friendly co-workers who help vigorously in a relaxed work environment. The cons was only that the breaks were extremely short giving little time to eat
good,"Yearly pay increases were more like every two-three years."
good,a typical day is come in go to the start up meeting find out the goal for that day . leave start up meeitng log into my computers check to c whats ready to b picked. If the work is not printed out i print in out and hand to associates to be picked and while they are picking that wave im checking to get the next wave of lable orders ready to  give out . while im make sure the guy that is running the merge has enough primary lanes to run the work threw the system. i would say the hardest part of the job is when its another department is behind now its putting your area behind .
good,"Always tried to put repair and sales customers needs first."
good,"The customer service department in an industrial manufacturing plant. There have been many changes in the year plus I have been there. The training is lacking and the management of the department could be improved. The people are great to work with and the work itself, while challenging, can be rewarding."
good,"good place to work at, fast paced but overall a good area, but my area wasn't a full-time area and didn't pay enough. they do have different areas to work at"
good,"It hard work and fast paced. Time fly by all the time cause you so busy working you don't have time to check. They're all about the company, not so much as employees."
good,"Job security is very high with this company, but depending on your department, there may be limited room for advancement. The work is consistent, so there is never a lack of work to do; so if you're fine with a delayed career advancement, or just looking for some good experience with a strong company, it's a great place to work."
good,"In hopes and dreams of retiring one dayfrom this company, I was dumbfounded at how they felt about the employees at the service centers. We were the lowest need thus making us highly expendable."
good,"Uma boa empresa, ambiente de trabalho muito bom, portanto deixam muito a desejar em relação a promoções e equiparação salarial."
good,"I worked here for a few months over the summer to make a little money before heading to school. The hiring process was simple and quick, essentially hired same day. The work wasnt bad fairly easy. At times work would be short and you'd end up just standing around, but at least you got paid to do it. There was plenty of overtime available. Overall not a bad place to work if you just want to make some quick cash and start working immediately."
good,Always behind on orders don't know whose fault that is but this lead us to work almost 7 days a week. Its very stressful. the work demands a lot from you. Since you join this company i guarantee you will have no life especially if you are in the 2nd shift. If you have a family good luck with that.
good,"too much growth but maybe lack of overall vision, however, good opportunity to grow if good fit into the culture. Many location globally so opportunity to travel."
good,"Love working here and the company continues to grow.  New CEO is incredibly dynamic and wants to grow the company further.  Great comp for managers, not so much for lower tier folks.."
good,Everyone there has been in the same position their whole career so there’s really no advancement opportunity and the raises are a joke. I got 2% after 2 years! I did like the fact that we got a lot of optional overtime and our boss always brought breakfast if we chose to come in Saturday’s to work on end of month billing. It was not bad. I left because the lack of pay.
good,"Great opportunity to work for Stanley Black + Decker. Great company with tons of benefits, resources, and a large portfolio of companies within. Great training and work/life balance."
good,"I like working here , but they don't respect employees schedule. They dont really care about the employee like that. They like to mandatory people to work on the weekends.  They pay good but you won't be able to enjoy with your family on the weekends"
good,"I had an excellent time working for Stanley. It had its ups and its downs, but overall this is a good company to work for. They care about their employees but I think the company itself doesn't allow for more than enough growth."
good,"Good company to work for, Lack of training by the manager & a bad way of communicating to employees, very hard to grow within the company with that type of atmisfear"
good,enjoyable work environment. friendly people. good benefits. good potential for advancement. large company with lots of training opportunity. good location close to major highways
good,Fast paced friendly and helpful co workers. Provided customer service over the phone and through emails and took parts orders
good,"SBD overall is a good company to work for. They have recently had a big turnover in IT management and this has cause a ""Centralized"" Mentality to creep back in. For this reason, Key positions within the global organization have been relocated to the corporate offices in CT. "
good,Hard work and difficult to advance within the company. Pay wasn't where I needed it to be to survive. The factory I was working closed and moved to Mexico. Put a lot of hard working people out of much needed jobs.
good,"Great environment to work in. "
good,"My day included supervising the shipping department, helping load/unload and receiving freight.  Entering Purchase Orders in SAP,verifying inventory/shipment records and correcting the errors.  The hardest part of the job was the mental pressure it placed on me.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with others and meet new people while getting the tasks at hand completed."
good,"Great work environment , Patient, Fair, I love them like family ,Getting the right parts to do your job, coming to work overall it sucks"
good,"working here was a great and interesting experience. Everyday was the same; on the phone calling customers regarding their security system. It was a very challenging job at times and also very tedious. There were great benefits, but lacked in the compensation area."
good,"Great company to work for "
good,"•	Inventory Specialist / Materials Coordinator    "
good,"Hard work but with fun times and good people to work with. learn about the making of motors and plastic parts, also put together of tools.  Management was okay, Most of the co-works were good to work with."
good,This company provided me the opportunity to continue my education and grow as an individual in the workplace. I learned almost everything I know about Industrial Manufacturing and machine repair from the people I worked with at Stanley Black and Decker.
good,"Long days and nights"
good,i worked 3rd shift and had exp i was a floater . My job was new each day.And i made good $

good,"Working closely with the Team and Channels to maximise the Sales and Revenues for the Region."
good,"Good workplace environment, excellent people to work with. Availabilty to work remotely."
good,It was a great place to work before Stanley took over in1986. . They are not family oriented. They had stopped giving out perfect attendance awards.
good,"They have the excellent schedule for break and lunch, Good environment for the workers. Employee anew friendly and helping nature.every thing is good."
good,Corporate buyout of there have been many changes this year.  Overall a somewhat successful transition.  Different working for such a large global company compared to the small business we worked in before
good,"They have a good company. The benefits are ok. They are a good company to start with in terms of customer service. "
good,"Pros: They have really Good benefits, medical and dental, company stock options, employee engagement activities  Cons: Its Pays monthly during the middle of the week"
good,"Was a great place to work 5 years back, not sure about now as the management is new."
good,Got paid pretty well just the benefits aren't very good. Your take home isn't very much because insurance takes a lot. If you are good at your job your chances of advancing or doing a lateral move are highly unlikely.
good,I have learned a lot in my time at SBD.  The job has taught me a lot about how to better run a business which has developed me for a bright future.  Running a service center is like running my own business.
good,Great place to work and the management is super friendly.  The position really added to my experience and multitasking skills.  I wold recommend this company to anyone that is well equipped to handle customer service and is wanting to advance in that field.
good,"Loved the people I worked with. Always joked around but got the job done. If I ever moved back, I'll work for them again. I would recommend anyone who wants to work there to go through temp. Then you'll get hired on."
good,"The company offer opportunities to learn new software and skills, job progression is good. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with big brands such as DEWALT, STANLEY and BLACK+DECKER."
good,"Jak asi dobře víme každá práce má své + a - , tak zde tomu není jinak, máte zde úseky kde se skoro ani nezastavíte ale pak tu jsou úseky kde děláte svou práci pěkně v klidu. Určitě si najdete i přátele ať romské nebo bílé, není to žádná rasistická firma a všichni v ní jsme si rovni. Samozřejmě né každý den je stejný, takže i na pozicích kde ste měli týden klidu se ,můžete pěkně zapotit :)"
good,I loved working there. Their staff is easy to talk too and they pay great. You get paid every week. Overtime available if you chose to stay and work. Lots of different areas to work.
good,I found myself learning new skills working at Stanley Black&Decker. Overall it was a great place to work and learn new skills of the trade. I was promoted soon which showed that management really cares for employees advancement.
good,"This organization was filled with great ideas, amazing products and good people. For a 175+ year old company, it is very innovative and constantly inventing new solutions and technologies that are first ever in the industry."
good,"Solid company, slow paced, work Force has been there for years, on-boarding is good, background process takes too long, lack of growth opportunities, need new life in the management"
good,this was a great company to work for. overall it was a good experience.  there were choices made by management that were positive and some that were less than favorable
good,Freedom to express ones ideas. Work culture is very understanding. Wonderful group of smart working people. got opportunity to work and understand big data.
good,"If you're looking for a fast-paced highly rewording company with excellent benefits, SBD is a great place to look. There is no shortage of work, and there can be long hours, but the coworkers are great and management encourages you along the way."
good,I really enjoyed working here. The only reason I left the company was I was a temp employee and I was offered a higher position at another company while working at both companies at the same time.
good,Good company to work with. You should come prepared because they hire people with experience and do not expect to be guided on your new job. Meeting with other nationalities is normal.
good,"I was a Forklift driver, and my job duties were to separate good pallets from bad in a designated location, also we had to take out bales of cardboard from the compressor and load onto trucks."
good,"I generally enjoy my job with this company and only considering leaving to help improve the future of my family and I. It is a little hot in there, and A/C would be a major plus."
good,"This company would act as a family to get the job done. The people I worked with were amazing. The supervisors took great care of us. Before a shift everybody participated in stretches. During the week of July, the supervisors would lay out bubble wrap while everybody was on lunch and after lunch they'll have us stomp on it for fun and for a stress reliever."
good,I have grown a lot with my experience working at Stanley and would recommend them to people looking for work. busy work environment so you have to be willing to work fast.
good,I diligently worked to facilitate an appropriate and productive communication tunnel between the CEO and the laborers on the floor. The CEO at the facility that I was stationed was very active and wanted to see the floor everyday. I attended every meeting and coordinated the meetings to address the problems viewed earlier and initiate the resolution process.
good,"Here is quiet easy job,not bed salary."
good,Great company with focus on innovation.  Strong leadership but many layers of managers with competing priorities.  Competitive culture.  Would work there again.
good,This was a decent place to work. The main con was that management wouldn't give much notice for mandatory overtime on weekends. Most of the management was easy to work with.
good,Good place to work to get started in the job force but dont stay. People only move up the ladder if you have family that has a history there. Management treats its workers pretty nice but the money is not great.
good,their a high turn around rate at this facility de to the temp. agencies there if they hired regular employees that actually cared about their jobs and duties it would be an awesome place to work.
good,"Ensures that all safety/housekeeping rules, regulations, and OSHA standards are adhered to."
good,The begining of your shift the team leader went over any new notices if any then we had our morning execerises then went to our line started making the drills our shift consists of 10 hours 4 days of the week and the 5th day was consider overtime .

Come back to the store and do the ordering or do the paper work to put the shipment received  in the system. I would do scheduling and payroll. Customer service and stock product and set up new floor plans from the district office. Make sure that everyone has had their break and make sure everyone is ok and doesn't have any questions. Some days work a double and close as well. Count the tills down at the end of the night and get the deposit all ready for the next day. I loved the manager that we had before I took over. Very respectful and appreciative of the employees. The hardest part of the job was not having the district manager being there when you needed help with anything. I loved that job but I had to leave to get a bigger box retail under my belt and to try to advance in the retail and management field so I could better provide for my family.
good,"Lots of great people, wealth of knowledge and experiences to learn from."

good,"The work pace can be very face paced but the ability to balance the job so easily with my personal life made it a very easy environment to adapt to."
good,"Everyday is a challenge, but with that challenge come a desire to accomplish success. From customer service, shipping, receiving, inventory management, coordinator, and accountant there is always something new and different to do. Multi-tasking all the above in one day is the hardest part of the job but I find it rewarding when I have completed all my job descriptions and look forward to a new challenge the next day. I am an individual who loves to be on the move, my mind thrives on new information and analyzing data. Management is very supportive on all the tasks that I do, and he can also rely on me to manage the service center when he is out of the office."

good,"It's a production job stamping out saw blades, painting and coating them. A lot of packing and shipping product out. Very simplistic operation.

I just didn't think I was being treated fair.
good,Job is fast paced and physically challenging for the first month your body and hands hurt. Some of coworkers are friendly and others are not so friendly.

The level of respect and appreciation was also important coming from upper management. Since change is always happening to make the company better specifically in the IT dept, you always had to be ready for change. Great company to work for."
good,"I always get to meet different people of ethnic cultures, but I have always learnt to put that aside and serve all of them with the most respect and hospitality they deserve. I have also been able to conduct myself to the standards of the management expectations. My co-workers and I have always get along and no more personalities issues at work has ever been in place. My hardest part is when customers might tend to send or even give you a  task that is not your in your department. I enjoyed the job because it was more of field work hence travelling to certain places inclusive of  transport allowance catered for. I also enjoy it when customers sometimes gave me remarks by thanking me on the way I have served them."

good,"After doing this job for seventeen years it put a lot of wear on me physically. I want a new job opportunity! I am currently in school and I have a lot of late nights. I have to be to work at five a.m. and stand for ten hours. It’s not a bad job, but standing in one place all day has taken a toll on my knee. I want to be moving and active as much as possible."

good,"suele ser entretenido, mucho trabajo."
good,A typical day at Black and Decker was a high paced job that required you to be willing to put forth a one hundrend percent effort. I learned how to work on my own on a daily basis to manage and control the inventory going in to the turret truck isles The co-workers were part of your team who made the job go smooth.

good,"Actual work was challenging. The co-workers I worked with were regular people and I had a great time with them at work and off work. I still stay in touch with a couple of them. My immediate IT Manager who hired me, until he was promoted was good to work for. The new one, who I did not know, care less of me and didn't care to know me, I was sorry to have been let go from the company due to restructuring and layoff."
good,"Great place to work, they invest in training and giving you the tools to be successful. This role works from home/out of a truck so there was a lot of driving involved."
good,"I really liked this job. Some of the management and HR would be my first complaints. HR has two people, one who is perfect for the job and one who shouldn't be there. There are a lot of people with the power to make decisions in the company. They usually makes one that tend to conflict with other people's plans. With this, there is a lot of them who try to avoid the responsibility when things are wrong or messed up. Overall, a lot of people try to avoid taking any blame and will be quick to push it towards someone else. A few people in the company have jobs that were created just specifically for them (and the position will disappear when they get fired, retire, or advance). There is a close family culture in the company but it comes down to mostly hourly employees being a group and salary being their own."

good,"Stanley Black & Decker was a company that always had high quality products.  I worked in the Industrial Hand Tool Division, which was mostly Proto Hand Tools and Stanley Trade Tools. This was a very good job, with new product always available to show the customers, which made the job very satisfying."
good,"I worked through a temp agency.  This was my first real job after I had my first son.  Sometimes I didn't know what line I would be working on, this job was an assembly job.  I had no problems with any of my management team and got along with my co-workers.  This was the 1st job that I worked on 1st shift, so I had to get use to getting up early in the morning.  The hardest part of this job was when I had to work on the lines dropping screws in the units.  And since my hands sweated most of the time I was only getting like 3 screws in there.  So working on an assebly line the other person would catch what I didn't do.  Even though I worked as a temp I enjoyed the job because we was treated like we was permanent Black and Decker worker.  I met a lot of good people.  And even though I would get laid off right before Christmas, I knew that I would be called back by the end of January or beginning of February."
good,The company is real great place to work for. My typical day starts with knowing what number of production my coworkers and i have to hit before the end of the night. The management of the place is very good. All managers and leads make sure work is finished.

good,"Sempre começar o dia Fazendo arrumações no PDV, Reposição, Abastecimento, Verificando Valores e verificações de e-mail."
good,Inbound call center 60-80 calls per day. 30-40 emails per day. Supporting end user customers.
good,"Excelente empresa em todos os quesitos, pessoal, chefia, maquinários e benefícios."

good,"Being in the field your work day is never the same.  I learned a lot in low-voltage.  You have a lot of freedom in the field although the constant traveling can make it difficult to balance home and work, as with any job that requires extensive travel.  There are some great people at Stanley and the company is not going anywhere."
good,"Clean work environment, they're willing to easily get along with and work with you if you are having any work related issues. Overall not a bad place to work."
