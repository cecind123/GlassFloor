rating,review
bad,It started off as a match made in heaven but ended up like Godzilla vs Tokyo. Processes were slow to non-existent. The only thing I liked was that I could do alot of what I wanted. Management turned out to be a joke between one guy mailing it in every day to another guy that wanted his job and was only there to massage his career path. I really liked the people there.
bad,Management is severely out-of-touch with staff and it shows in every possible way! Extreme lack of communication inhibits career growth and development!
bad,Good company run by incompetent people who value your ability to kiss up rather than your ability to work. If you enjoy working for a company that promotes people based on factors other than work performance this is the place for you.
good,They pay decent but we work a lot of hours. Doesn't leave much time for family. The company doesn't promote from within much. The job does allow for a lot of freedom.
good,It started as a great place to work. With the crunch in oil and gas many things changed and with it so did the culture of Range. I hope they can find the footing they need to make it work.
good,very fast paced environment which made time go by quickly. Overall great place to get in on the Oil and Gas boom of 2007 and beyond. Got a chance to be involved in many departments which provided a strong learning experience.
good,"The company is presently transitioning into new innovative daily operations and workflow processes. Learning is always a factor in any position to accomplish the required goals. However, a point-of-view from a contract employee would not be accurate as far as the workplace atmosphere."
good,"Organizational focus on lower OpEx than their competition, tends to leave employees stretched thin.  Overwork, coupled with sector's downturn and falling stock prices has created a discouraged workforce."
good,"Range is a great place to work.  Very family oriented.  Unfortunately, the pay is so-so.  Great benefits though.  I enjoy my co-workers and my boss.  Flex schedule is awesome"
good,Very friendly work environment where team work is essential to success. Bid's were done months in advance of new year. Hardest part of job was getting everyone to buy in to change.
good,Range gave me a lot of opportunities and learned a lot.  I learned serval different jobs there and really liked the fact of learning new things and different jobs
good,"Bad Upper Management, Working in the gas field is good. For the most part you get to be your on boss and there is no hectic schedule."
good,"A typical workday for me at Range Resources involved creating and updating reporting programs for the accounting and operations departments. In addition to this I updated technical documentation for any reports that were worked on. I learned how to prioritize tasks and that productivity and output are far more important than perfection. My coworkers were hard workers who collaborated well on various projects. Each of my coworkers had a wealth of knowledge in their respective expertises and I enjoyed picking their brains. I was in charge of reporting, one coworker was in charge of developing the database for our BI system, another coworker was the on-site AS/400 developer, and there were three analysts who served as the go-between for the developers and the end-users. Management had a tremendous amount of experience in the oil and gas industry and were a valuable resource for various assignments I worked on. I reported to one manager who oversaw the three developers and he reported to the manager who was in charge of IT-support (which had 8 employees). The hardest part of my job was managing end-user expectations. The most enjoyable part of my job was struggling to keep up with end-user requests when I was the only report developer."
good,"Range was a good place to work. Compensation was decent, and company culture has changed over the years, but that happens when a company grows in size. Range employees are great people to work with."
good,"Management is very results oriented, but open to new analysis techniques and ideas."
good,"Range Resources is a promising company in a country that does not yet have the necessary infrastructure for it to thrive. Overall, Range Resources provides its employees with good wages and rewarding work.

good,My time at this company was very enjoyable. I appreciated working with a lot of very smart people who were willing to share information and teach others.

good,"My college degree is in Psychology.  After having my daughter, I took some time off from my job I had at the time.  When I was ready to get back into the workforce, I was offered the opportunity to get into the oil and gas field.  I was able to obtain a lot of useful and helpful knowledge for the up and coming field through the help of many company employees and management."
good,Range is a company that believes in teamwork and cares about what each individual thinks when it applies to their job. They really listen. You cant beat the pay and benefits or the atmoshere.
