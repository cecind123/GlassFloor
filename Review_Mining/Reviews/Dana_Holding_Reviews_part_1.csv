bad,you either run a line or inspect parts or assemble units you have no choice but to work overtime here 6 days a week with mandatory overtime from supervisors
bad,This job is terrible and if u have not been there 25 plus years not the place for you and your going to work 7 days a week 12 hours a day with not a lot of time off the pay is not bad but for 7 days a week not worth it at all the supervisors are very rude and mean and only care about u making them look good the place is a joke.
bad,No respect for you or the holidays. We dont make sense we make oil coolers. Thats been the slogan for 10yrs and ots only got worse. They could hirer more operators to help reduce the ot but they would rather burn out all there long term employees forceing us to work 7days 12hours everyday. Then the holidays come and they refuse to give anyone a day off for months. Run if you can.
bad,The most poorly managed organization I have ever worked for. The people on the floor are nasty and love to spread gossip and rumours that are unfounded. I wouldn’t trust anyone in this company to walk my grandmother across the street.
bad,Absolutely terrible I would not recommend anyone to work at this place because a lot of politics are in wall and you will not be happy in the long run yes you will make a lots of money but money isn't everything
bad,The machine are old so they break down a lot some management is cool others are horrible the people are somewhat it can be very childish kinda highschool vibes Dana is a Revolving door you need to do good there or get replaced They hire you you were still treat you like your a temp
bad,"Management is horrible,  they never give a day off,  I was let go because I was 1 hour late for my shift.  Never missed a day,  and they let me go over 1 hour.  Some coworkers are rude to contractors.  Very in organized.  My teammates reported me as a no call no show, when in fact I was only an hour late.  I lost my job because he never went and changed the paperwork. I lost my job because someone else didn't do theirs. someone"
bad,"I previously worked at the Paris, TN location as a member of manager. The plant director was one of the most unprofessional and unethical people in any profession that I have seen or been a part of. Multiple investigations regarding business conduct to employees and harassment claims. The HR team supports the demonstrative behavior and has zero integrity saying that the director is good for the business while the people are suffering"
bad,"Don't care about home life, your life is dictated by Dana. Makes temps work wether their line is running or not, mgt sucks, union sucks, and Dana lied to lure all the older seniority to take the jobs. Dana is not a good place all the way around.😡"
bad,Management is a joke treat their workers horribly work you 7 days a week no days off because management has no clue what their doing waste of time there's a reason why the turnover rate is so high
bad,"This job is not for everyone. For those that don't mind working a lot of overtime. This job might be for you. Plenty of money to be made here thats for sure. The temps however walk into a 12 hour shift daily. It's either 6-6 or 2-2, 10-10. And that's 7 days a week not exaggerating. No respect for people's home life at all. Management spends their entire day worrying about what the employees on the floor are doing instead of focusing on the tasks that they are hired to perform. They take pictures of the employees and hold countless meetings daily to blame the employees for not hitting their numbers. But the fact of the matter is we run parts that are not on the days run because we either run out of components which drives the need for mandatory Saturdays and Sundays, or the engineering team can't get equipment to run without calling in a outside source to fix these equipment issues. That also drives the mandatory Saturdays and Sundays.This place is so poorly managed on a daily basis from lack of support from the engineering team, upper management to the Supervisors. If you can handle all the inconveniences and incompetence you can make $100k a year on the floor."
bad,I wouldn't work here you're treated like a robot and expected to go above and beyond for average wages. They crack the whip on you constantly and mandate you all summer when it's over 100 degrees in the building. Dead end job not a career. They just keep taking more and more away from the employees
bad,I worked at this job part-time while going to college. Pay was pretty good for an 18 year old straight out of high school and needed a job. I work 3rd Shift 11 to 7 and they work with my schedule at school.
bad,"You're not treated like a person by management, they also tell you that you have weekends off but then schedule everyone who hasn't put volunteer hours in to work."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work here. 70% of the employees and management are prejudice and are not fair when it comes to any job position. Very hostile work place as well. Very hot. Management are very inconsiderate!!
bad,I put in for 7 different job advancements and was given 7 different reasons why I couldn't get them. But I was good enough to be back up team leader for 2 years.
bad,"It starts out feeling like it will be a good job. But then you find out that the management picks favorites who can get away with everything, and if they don't like you, they will find a reason to get you fired."
bad,Over work people poor benefits horrible management poor floor communication need updated machines in order to keep production going have to work 19 days consecutively for a weekend off
bad,The Management sucked all it wanted was --- kissers the last 10 years. It had good workers and the enployes got along good but the management tried to cause problems.Everything could be going good and the would change something to cause trouble and we had no eng. in the later years
bad,"Working at Dana Corp. was not good at all. No benefits, minimum wages, no advancement. I was hurt on the job and was released because of my injuries that another employee caused."
bad,"Good pay increases and many chances for advancement. They treated their employees well. Would still be working for they, but the sold the company. With this the plant was closed."
bad,the lie to you and con you into working for them until the probation period is over then they fire you or lay you off.
bad,"I worked at Dana for 4 years. I was layed off August 1, 2008. I was told I would be called back to work. I was a team player and worked hard at my job. I even went to Toyota Princeton by myself for a quality issue. After never missing a day of work and never late Dana, Gordonsville hired people who were previously fired for attendance. They never called not only myself but others. This company does not care about its workers. Don't go there."
bad,"They expect you to work six and seven days a week and ask daily for you to work over four hours. I was hired as a maintenance tech but my job consisted of ninety percent mold setting. The maintenance supervision and production supervision wasn't even in the same book, much less on the same page."
bad,"Temps get treated badly, and don't believe in giving them time off. Never get off let full time people go home and temps have to complete tasks left to do rest of the day."
bad,I'm not sure about Dana's sustainability as a truly innovative force in the auto industry. There has been tremendous management turnover the past several years that doesn't make sense. The private equity firm behind the scenes (Centerbridge) is very secretive and cannot be trusted. Centerbridge doesn't seem to be allowing any meaningful promotions. They always hire from outside...never a good sign. Centerbridge seems to be pushing Dana in the wrong direction.
bad,They’re hr is horrible they’re supervisor are either untrained or old whit ashol*  they don’t bother fixing problems present to them  and they don’t care about your points that there broke time clock just gives out
bad,The company discriminates against men and women in the protected class.  They are not effective in communicating changes to their employees.  Management does not respect their workers and the Human Resources Department is lacking professionalism and respect as well.
bad,After management changed.    The new warden let the inmates run the prison cant change the culture that way.  I believe in promoting from within but it is very difficult in a union shop
bad,Too many bosses and none of them hardly knows anything they just point fingers they might say get a certain number of parts out and you will be off the weekend so everyone works extra hard to get it done then they say you still gotta work the weekend what a joke
bad,"The problem with Dana is that you have peole in the office who act as if they are still in high school, talking about people, men gossiping like women!"
bad,Terrible management treats employees like dogs one of the worst managed companies ive ever seen. You can work here very hard and management dont care about the people that gets the job done.
bad,"Dana is a good place to work as far as a stepping stone, but there are a lot of issues that need to change such as the mindsets of managers on how people are treated there. Management lacks humanities and is sometimes mechanical when it comes to its workers."
bad,Good money but treated horribly. The management didn’t care about you but then again the guys above them don’t care about them ether. The union is horrible
bad,"Dana focuses on a young work force and doesn't try to advance experienced professionals. Management gives preferential treatment to the younger employees. Every focus group or training seminar was tapered to the Millennials. When I brought it up , I was frowned upon. Additionally, I wasn't given any training for my position."
bad,"Your typical day starts with getting there on time which is difficult because the clocks tend to not be in sync, you have a shift meeting, then move on to your assigned work area, you do your start up procedures(paperwork, safety check offs and ""feedback"" with the previous operator) and finish in the time allowed so you can move into position to do your job. The problems are 1 -  The atmosphere in our plant is borderline hostile/threatening  between upper management and employees and upper management seems to encourage this. 2 - We work MANY overtime hours and weekends with no upper management or salary support and yet are told constantly it is because WE have to much absenteeism. ( we tend to have salary meetings held most of the dayshift hours so there are many weekday hours there is no one there for support) 3 - Moral is at the lowest i have ever personally seen and daily they find a way to bring it down more, the overall feeling is we are being set up to fail which seems ridiculous but is not."
bad,"You must arrive to work earlier then normal because the clocks are set ahead of time.  I learned how the part works in a car.  The hardest part of the job is the shift(night), heat and constant over time,the best part is the socal after work and going home."
bad,At one I thought it was a good place to work but that change when I started working there and they started making a lot of changes. The plant is really going down
bad,No life at home work 7 days a week. Heavy lifting they don provide vision insurance into a year . And you get no call offs during your 120 probation period.
bad,"This company could be better, But They over work their employee's. They spend money on the wrong things, machines break down often with little to no repair"
bad,"Worse place to work. Supervisor are childish, petty, abuse of power, unprofessional and liars. The pay is only good because of all the overtime you get but you won’t have a social or family life. You work 7 days a week and only get 1-2 days off a month. The benefits are great so that’s not bad."
bad,"My Father retired from Dana Corp around 1999 or 2000. After working there for over 30 years, busting his A** for them almost everyday, he retired. Shortly after he was diagnosed with Cancer. He fought it for many years. BUT during that time Dana Corp decided that the same people that spent most of their lives working for them, making them millions, they would screw those same people over. To save the company money, they decided to take away what the retirees had been promised. They did away with a big portion of their retiree benefits. Including their dental and vison insurance and most importantly, they took away their LIFE INSURANCE... over 30+ years my Father broke his back for this company and to show their gratitude, they screw them out of what was rightfully theirs. My Father passed away 2 years ago this May.. No, he did not get a proper burial, all we could afford was to have him cremated.. So if you decide you want to go work for a good company that will set you up for retirement.. Dana Corp is NOT the place.. once you are done working for them they dont give a SH** about you. Infact, I will never again purchase anything made by them.. by choice.. they dont deserve my business.. they got over 30 years of my Dads life and said to hell with him once he was done. They are a heartless company. That is my review of Dana Corp."
bad,"No work life balance, work seven days a week, once your ran into the ground and start picking up points they fire you with no point forgiveness knowing they work you 7 days a week, it’s like a slap in the face to see upper Management come in from having a wonderful weekend an demanding more from someone that’s been giving their all the entire weekend!!!"
bad,"Anyone who had worked in the dry ridge facility can tell you, it's awful. You work there because it's close, and the only job in the area paying well. You can expect to work 72-84 hours a week, no time off and no sick days. Also, management is garbage. Couple good supervisors, but doesn't change anything."
bad,Poor management and long hours. Never got to see my family. It's a good place for a single person who doesn't want a life otherwise steer clear. The company only cares about getting products out the door. There is no work life balance.
bad,it was a good place to work .jobs leaving for other countries and other states it was a union plant nobody pushed you there was a lot of overtime times change. good pay
bad,"After the acquisition from Fairfield/Oerlikon to Dana in Lafayette, In. the company went down hill. Upper management does not communicate with management on the floor. Dana is going to ruin everything Fairfield spent years developing and maintaining for years before."
bad,The best part was having a job. The worst was when they closed the Milwaukee Plant. The best was the people i worked with The worst part when they closed the Milwaukee Plant.  Walking out the door on the last day.:-( :-(
bad,fast paced. they do not like any mistakes or u r let go. management seems as if noone can do anything right. they r digging own hole. I won't give good review or recommend to anyone I know.
bad,"While I was there,  the management was disorganized and had poor direction. Operated on outdated prints given to suppliers, and would not make corrections. Had staff designed to review tbe books and directions of suppliers. Did not work.Poor goals, and they opetated an outdated plant that they wanted to sell. No one was interested."
bad,"Dana could be a much better place to work at if they would change some things. They give the supervisors way to much power, they lied about vacation days. They do not pay accurately for the work that you do. Meaning, if you make 13.50/hr, you make a net of around 800, you will only bring home $533, or sometimes you'll bring home $650. for whatever reason, you'll work the same shift for two weeks and bring home two different amounts.You only a day off every 19 DAYS, even though you work 7 days a week."
bad,"Orientation itself is a disaster.  Half of the group they sent home after they disclosed their background.  Employer should have not wasted their time, for some people came quite a distance to get there.  Six hour classroom and hands on orientation.  Way too strict - have to go through security to even go to the restroom."
bad,"Glad to be retired from Dana..Management has driven Dana into the ground.If they  managed it better, they could afford to pay the younger workers more and hire some decent workers."
bad,"This is an easy job,but the people are difficult to work with,I was harassed by a fellow co-worker and because he was there for over a year nobody believed me and they stopped speaking to me.These are adults we are talking about but they acted like high school kids.My manager was awesome but nothing was done about the harassment so thats why i left."
bad,Dana works their employees 7 days a week with no days off. The benefits offered are pretty good. Upper Management needs major improvement. The union isn’t very strong.
bad,Most personnel resisted modernization of machines and processes. Difficult to create and advance a culture of cooperation. Rarely enjoyed going to work
bad,I was a crane operator for a parent company for the ford plant
bad,No longer in bussiness. Management horrible. poor work area. short breaks.
bad,The money is ok if you can work 12hrs a day 7 day's a week the supervisor does not talk to you like a human being very un organizations make the rules up as they go along different rules for different people to much favoritism
bad,bad management treated workers bad no time off unhealthy dirty no reward for hard work unsafe work place lean manurfactering meaning 1 person done 2 or 3 person job
bad,Company is not trustworthy ..negotiated contract  then closed plant while building a new facility in another state..while working enormous amount of overtime..
bad,Worked there for four years and it was three years too long. Promotion opportunities are given to those who are friends with management instead of experienced and qualified applicants. Work life balance is poorly lacking and leaves little room to make plans on home front.
bad,no family time and they don't car about their employees just work work work not people friendly (supervisors) if you have concerns trying to talk with the upper management really does work they don't have time for chit chat they want you on the line  all the time even through breaks sometimes
bad,"The management is awful, to much favoritism and singling out un-liked employees. How ever the work is really easy and the coworkers are amazing. If it wasn't for the management I would probably still be working there."
bad,"Working at Dana, they don’t have a balance between work and home life. They work you 12hours a day seven days a week, you will spend more time at work than you do at home."
bad,"Horrible culture,  Some of the HR are people are not helpful.. Some supervisors only seem to get people fired. Not a safe place to work for. Have no time for personal life. Work every day all day... No days off..."
bad,"Management stands over people and sneaks around to watch. They pick favorites. If they decide they don't like you, you're gone. I would highly recommend finding another job before going to Dana."
bad,"I loved my job the first week or so i was there...after that u quickly saw that some people werent held to the same standard as others which really made me start to hate my job. I was always over my production yet never recieved any praise for it. I felt as if i was working hard for nothing. They dont like temporary associates there. The temps cant even get in the building by themselves, and are basically made to work every weekend as the fulltime associates get off.not a fair playing field"
bad,"Organization is not well organized at any level. They mandate too many work hours every day, leaving no personal time for rest and relaxation with family members and friends. The company forces hourly workers to work seven days a week MANDATORY time."
bad,The people you work with on the floor for the most part are great. Management is a joke and very poor to the floor workers who help make this place what it is. They do not let anything get fixed right because they want to run it 24/7 so they just put a bandaid on it and keep going.
bad,Word day start Load trucks and replenish stock in work sells.The people worked as a great team . But the product volumes were very hi and hard for everyone to keep up.
bad,"A typical day at work would be preforming paperwork work for out going & in coming goods. Preparing ASN on the computer for Ford,Chrysler,Gm,etc. I learned how to be come self motivated in day to day operations and also multi task in more effective ways. Management could be better with it's organization, needs more work on employee & management relations with hourly workers. My co-workers are the best, we help one another get daily task done. The hardest part of the job is when your short handed. The most enjoyable part of the job is when almost everything runs smooth & orders set to be shipped out are complete.     "
bad,"Tier 1 automotive supplier, over 100 yrs old. Most employees are from the area where the company is located. Very traditiional culture. Women should avoid this company."
bad,you work 7 days a week.  There is no such thing as work/ family balance.  They could care less. Union is a joke.  6 point attendance policy.  late 1/2 point.  call off 1 point.   Upper management is clueless to what is needed on the shop floor.  VERY disappointing.
bad,"Floor supervisors are generally good and supportive, but upper management and office staff are backstabbing, bumbling idiots whose poor decisions trickle down to bite workers."
bad,"I don’t like the place, unprofessional. Lack of communication. They favoritism individuals instead of going off work ethic. Too many safety hazards!!! The place is a great start to build your career. Hours are crazy there. I’m jus tired of the place because it’s no acknowledgement, no leadership it’s jus terr there"
bad,bad management overall if you want to make money you will but you will but never will have time to spend it. Supervisors are not to bright because the turnover rate is high. union leadership is terrible.
bad,"Dana now is nothing like most think they know it to be. Management is the absolute worst. Backstabbing, dishonest, inconsistent is just a few ways of describing management. The pay is low. The scare of being fired or ecspecially being laid off is constant. The majority of hourly workers are cool but are very arrogant just because it's Dana. It's nothing special whatsoever. Other companies pay a whole lot more."
bad,You will not get a full weekend off here. The las full weekend we had off was September 2018. You might get the occasional Sunday off if you're lucky. It'll be all the overtime you want and then some. Decent benefits and 401k though. Management is a joke.
bad,you will come into contact with different workers some good and others bad. Trying to get a team to work together was not easy. Everyone just wanted to work their area and nothing else. Many operators throw in your face about the union and their seniority. They don't understand what the union stand for and their seniority is under 5 years. A lot of show up workers who don't want to work. HR was no help in getting the operators removed.
bad,"Leadership/culture is poor. Everything is about quantity, everything else is secondary and no one cares. The Union runs the place and management has virtually no rights. There is no synchronization of any work units which causes confusion in operations. Supervisors are treated like they are disposable, but they won't fire anyone. 20% of the supervisory staff does 80% of the work. If you do well you will never advance. 10 hour day minimum before OT. Work/life balance is a foreign concept. Pay is ok. 401K is very good."
bad,"Dana hired me to make improvements and changes, but they wasn't ready for change. The management team has been there for years and don't want to improve.  This is the worst job I ever had."
bad,The culture in our plant changed with the new plant manager. Dana was a really great place to work until the last 5 months. Other plants might still be good to work for.
bad,cnc machine operator I had to program and repair the machine and change the tooling and load and unload and unpack the parts and do my own quality checks what happened to quality control personel job wasn't worth it so I left for a easier higher paying job
bad,"Unsafe work environment.poor management, supervision,safety practice. Didn't take constructive input from employees. Forced employees to vote in Union from lack of confidence."
bad,Started off as a great company but ended with poor management . Great employees to work with and great customers we dealt with. Enjoyed my job while there
bad,"My day consisted of being at work at 6am and getting off at 2pm, sometimes 6pm. I worked 12 hour shifts for 3 straight months without a day off. We worked 7 days a week, the management was alright. My co-workers were pretty awesome, they taught me a lot I needed to know since that was my first factory job. The hardest part was when my machine failed, or wouldn't pass an axel. The most enjoyable part of the job was to learn how the axels were put together."
bad,Dana suffers from a lot of turnover.  Management is disorganized.  No long term strategy.  They continue to lose Market share and have had 5 new CEO's in six years.
bad,Do not apply for this job unless you have no life or family. If you like working 8 to 12 hour days 7 days a week with maybe 2 days a month off then this is the job for you. If you like being lied to and secrets kept from you then this is the job for you. If you like not knowing when your shift starts or ends until the day of then this is the job for you. Be prepared to live in Dana when applying for this job.
bad,"Fast pace job, but a good place to work. This was a nice place to work. Everyone was nice and always willing to help."
bad,"my position was 2nd shift supervisor. 1st shift supervisors wanted one of the 1st employees promoted to this position. they were not very helpfull, to say the least, with my training."
bad,I learned to weld took care of tools and parts co-workers were out to get you and the management was a out to get you
bad,"I was hired to work on axle development, in particular I was chosen and offered a hirer rate of pay than other designers because of my proficiency in GD&T."
bad,A typical day at work consists of being assigned to a certain cell for the day and told how much of a certain part you are required to make as a team member.
bad,I was unhappy both years I worked there.  My last supervisor was good but the first ones were not.  They drove me away along with a lot of other turnover.
bad,Management cannot fully attend to their responsibilities due to meetings all day long.  No resources available.  Learn as you go on your own.  No training whatsoever.
bad,Dana pay scale was great.  The environment and upper management was very poor. The most diappointing issue was when it came to ending contract employees instead of being direct they rather send a text over the company phone then ask for their equipment back. Very rude in nature and it shows the lack of professionalism by upper management.
bad,"Driving Process improvement by collaborating with the suppliers for Axle components. "
bad,"Overall the facility was outstanding for a factory, Clean and very bright. However poor financial decisions has them running customer out of parts or very close to it almost weekly.  This makes everyone always on edge and stressed out."
bad,Many projects to work on.  Compensation is adequate.  Benefits packages are competitive.  Work hours are 8-4:30 typically.  Working on new projects can be fun.
bad,Busy and poor management. Long hours on your feet. Heavy steel. High in summer. Cold in winter. Management can’t seem to go a pair and make everyone work equally. There are favorites.
bad,"Would not recommend, have been working 7 days a week since February's, upper management keeps things away from employees so we have no idea how far behind we are, so no end in sight of seeing our families again, unorganized beyond belief, not sure how the company is still up and running"
bad,"Companies like this is why Unions came into existence years ago because at least you could have a decent lifestyle and be able to spend time with your family but those days are gone and it's going to go back to those dark days again."
bad,"Too many hours at work, usually six or seven days a week,with some twelve hour days included. I have worked up to 19 days in a row without a day off. Plant is hot in many areas with air conditioning always broken down and has poor air circulation. Production is set high and the employees are blamed when overtime is needed. This overtime is forced and you can point out when you decline it. Some workers pay up to 100 dollars to others to work their overtime so they can get some time off. In the long run this leads to joint pain and other health problems. Operators get the blame for low production due to poor press maintenance. Pay and benefits are good for the area, but if you have any hobbies or need weekends off, i would look elsewhere for employment."
bad,Dana was probably a typical manufacturing production environment for automotive components. Between machine breakdowns in employee issues this was a very busy place to work.  Deadlines were unforgiving and challenges were many.
bad,"It is a small factory and as such they try to keep the number of employees down, which is expected. However, they also try to bring new business in and instead of bringing more workers in to help, they just ask more of the current employees; or just mandate 50+ weekly hours."
bad,"The management team used to be like family. Now have new management in there and it is a very divided team. For the most part, it was pretty good place to work until the last year."
bad,"I Learned to work on production floor and then in the office, so I knew what they were going through."
bad,the hardest part of the job was putting up with management in the last 10 years they changed management 5 times
bad,Management was very difficult to work for. I worked for this after going to college for two years and it was a great place to work for at least 15 years. For the the last 11 years the company has gone downhill due to management.
bad,I can’t say many things for that company it a temporary opening not hiring I think it really good they always still busy people or some friends who work there are very fine
bad,"At first I really loved working for Dana , but got lied right too my face. The hours kept picking up ... which was fine until we got no days off . 7 days a week of 12s. People burnt out and miserable . Management didn’t seem too care. They get too see their families.. we don’t.."
bad,"They over work employees and it's poorly managed. Don't hear out employees and expect  everyone's lives to revolve around the factory, 80 hour weeks makes maintaining a life difficult."
bad,"A typical day at dana was a hot one. They were an okay employer, except they act like they don't really care for their employees. I learned how to run machines. My co-workers were helpful and amazing people. The hardest part of my job was the heat and trying not to burn myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay ."
bad,"This is a factory and is good for a first time job experience.  It is located on Manchester in St. Louis.  I worked there so long ago, not sure if it has changed."
bad,Dana pays really good money and the managers well some of the managers there are highly knowledgeable and Willi to help. The only down fall if that you have no life outside of there. You work seven days a week barely get time off and I worked second shift which was from 3 to 11pm. They also have free soda in the lunch room.
bad,No not a good place. Money good but you won't have time for nothing else. The money is good along with benefitd. But in winter it's freezing..... No snow days u still work regardless.  In summer it's extremely hot.
good,Very fast paced place to work and getting used to working a lot of hours in the heat and lifting very heavy parts is a challenge. I mostly enjoy learning the day to day duties in manufacturing.
good,didn’t much care for the place. Schedule sucked and forced overtime. Stuck doing a lot of work while others get off doing nothing. Different rules for different people.
good,No job security. Poor management. Rotated jobs every two hours
good,"No direction, Upper management, Seen over 15 different shift supervisors in a 2 year period, Never new who was your Area Manager was and at times did not even have one."
good,I was in the heat treat dept where i had to take these steel trays with rings on them an line them up an send threw the fire pit as they called it an get them threw the other side of furnace an cool them with a coolant tank
good,Una experiencia fantastica. Entorno agradable y competitivo
good,Dana is a great company to work for nice people easy work the pay is nice management really nice just all around nice place we ship out driveshafts for semies
good,Was not my fault .not did right management was very bad at the time. Maybe good now don’t know. Help a worker in need bet me for life love my job at that time.
good,It seems that management doesn't have a clue what to do. Pay and benefits are okay. There are a lot of really good people there but the culture is broken.
good,"Consistent turnover at management, if you plan to hire in make sure you get everything in writing, was lied to on numerous items. As floor supervisor support was non-existent from upper managers. You will work 7 days a week "
good,there are better jobs with less stress. you can make a good living but you will basically live there. if you get stressed easily this job is not for you. this job is very physically demanding. great job for a younger guy/girl with no kids and wants to work everyday to make decent money..
good,"Company went out of business back in 2006. Company no longer in Danville, IN. People were fun to work with, but we were overworked by management. A lot of gossip at tomes and backstabbing, but jokes too."
good,"A typical day of work is very busy, depending on what job you are doing. A scheduling position is very time consuming and tedious work. A tracking position is a light work load as long as material is coming in on time."
good,"There was no typical day at work."
good,"I just need more time with my family. 2nd shift isnt a family shift. When i hired in, i was under the impression that I could get a 1st or 3rd shift job. Thwn I got 2nds and 2 years later I'm still on 2nds."
good,"Horrible place to work!! Long hours, No teamwork, Unappreciative supervisors, Hot and smells, oily and dirty. Just over all terrible place to work....."
good,Worked everyday although it’s first told “optional overtime”. But it becomes mandatory overtime all the time. If you call out for overtime then it counts against you.
good,"You work straight shift, no rotation. Working at the back of the furnace during summer is brutal. There is no proper ventilation inside the building, no air circulation. People in the management dont care about the people on the floor. They dont talk to you and only know you by your employee no. and not by name."
good,Dana company stock slid heavily in my time employed by them as an engineer.  The response to customer quality concerns was not handled in a positive manner that I would expect from a world class engineering company.  The work place culture was laid back however certain management would prefer a strict schedule for salaried associates that was not fair in my opinion especially when you would already work over 40hrs a week as it was.   It was recently announced that they would be implementing SAP which was exciting to simpleize how the company ran however it was later announced that they would keep some old systems and the SAP roll out would not be all encompassing.  They do have nice company parties and the onsite cafeteria and other amenities are a nice perk.
good,"Scince Dana took over the employment practices make no sense, minority seems to rule. They have exibited a disconcern about quality of product, and scap ratio is at 40% or higher. They do not value long term employees, insights as to the operation of equiptment or capabilities of the same. They do pay well however, just blindly do as corporate people want . Don't ever ridicule anyone ."
good,"I have work there for 10 years and the only  reason i have stayed there is because its only minutes away from home. And for me that is the only good thing about that place."
good,I enjoyed working here even though there wasn't much money advancements.
good,"plant closed down not a whole lot to say. when it was opend it could have ran better, but at every angle it was stepped on."
good,At Dana Warren facility we worked anywhere from 8 hours a day all the way up to 12 hours a day. Some lines work 5 days a week an there are also some that work 7 days a week 19 days in a row before you get a weekend off etc. Saturday an Sunday.
good,Some supervisors don’t wanna help just want you to run faster... some don’t care quality but the want  quantity.... They will put a formal write up if you’ve never been rejected
good,"The position that I held was in management. The hours are brutally long and are not over when you walk out the door. The phone rings at all hours of the night/day with ""concerns"" and questions needing answered. The culture between the staff is great however, the culture with the management is less than desirable. Everyone tries to push their work onto someone else. They tell you that you can take a lunch break but expect it to be either at your desk on on the phone while you eat."
good,"Favoritism runs rampant, the best part about working here is the reliability of the work. Also, there are a few good people working here, but if you're not part of the clique you get thrown under the bus."
good,"Working at Dana was a good job, besides the supervisor I had the pay was acceptable, and the hours were manageable, but the environment of the facility was overwhelming, and had chemicals in the air once you walked in."
good,Dana was a decent place of employment with good health insurance benefits.  The uncertanitiy of never knowing when it was closing the doors for many many years.
good,Very stressful place to work its a UAW facility which lends it self to a different mentality. Political and poor work life balance as they will burn you out quickly. Little to none employee involvement with decision making.
good,"Expect long hours, Dysfunctional Management team, must be one of the good ole boys. Woman in Management is scarce and are not to speak their mind or they are considered unprofessional."
good,"It was an average place to work.  The best part about the job was the people who worked side by side with you.  There were times we would be on a long stretch of 12 hour days, 7 days a week.  There were other times you didn't know if you would get 40 hours.  The work was not hard, just repetitive."
good,"Worked 10 hr day 7 days a weeks in order to meet customer demand"
good,"I would recommend Dana Corp. for individuals seeking a Supervisor Position who are flexible, have strong leadership skills, and are available to work overtime."
good,decent pay but long hours. most work is very challenging.  typical noisy manufacturing atmosphere but they do their best to keep it bright and as clean as possible
good,"Extremely long hours, with little to no days off for weeks.  Management is okay as long as your in there click.  The hours is the hardest part of the job, there is really no time for a life outside the walls. The most enjoyable part of the job is defiantly the paycheck."
good,"It was a decent place to work, I am not sure if the plant manager is still there.  It was a bit micromanaged and hired within people that lack the management roll."
good,"The guy next to u could be making 5 more dollars an hour doing same job. More time laid off than working. Machines outdated coolant "
good,Dana was a great place to work just closed and got to find a mew had life had great insurance and benefits but poor management but that's life worked a lot of overtime .
good,checking parts on the hour  driving lift truck into semis unload dock work checking parts and assemble them good people to work with good foremans people help each other  you learn a lot each day there
good,"Training for hand assembly of power steering lines for Ford Motor Co  Trained for each position as is required, ability to bid on other positions, but no opportunity for advancement.."
good,"I do not recommend anyone with kids to work here. it 12 hours a day 6 to 7 days a week. the management is very poorly handled. Even if you run out of parts and they don't know when they are coming in, you have to stand around during your shift even if it means standing around the rest of your shift instead of going home."
good,"You can make good money at Dana, but you have to deal with managements short comings on a daily basis. The actual work itself is not that hard but the people and the union try to make you think they work harder than anyone on the planet. That aint true! lol"
good,"Contract worker"
good,"Dana is not a bad place to work on the production side. The pay is really good for machine operators.  $18.25 for tier 2, and $21 for tier 1. It is a very easy job and you can make a lot of money if you like to work lots of overtime. The maintenance department gets blamed for a lot of things that are out of their control and the pay for maintenance techs is not very competitive for the market in our area. You top out at $23 per hr but you have a lot of skills you need to know and a lot of responsibility. Overall its not horrible but it would be better if maint techs were compensated a lot better."
good,"Learned team leader skills as a result of working here i was responsible for 12-14 employees at a time. Downside was had to work with a new supervisor roughly every mouth. Machines where extremely old and in a state of disrepair. Hardest part was working with new supervisors and helping them learn how to work in a team environment, they usually hired without regard to experience."
good,"Most work weeks are 7 days, 8 hour shifts. Pay is around $12.00 an hour. While you make decent money, you have no home life. I have personally worked over 30 days without a day off, and know people that have worked 3 months(or more) before getting ONE day off.You can bid on jobs within the company, and if you can get another job, perhaps the hours get better, however most of the time they have someone in mind for the position and if it isn't you then you are out of luck."
good,On a typical work week you never know if your are goin to work a whole week or get laid off.
good,If you get hurt on the job you will have a target on your back and will try anything to get rid of you. pay is good vacation time is good. Some good people to work with some not so much.
good,Dana corporation is an ok place to work. There is a lot you can learn there. Management is not always so great but if you come to work it can be rewarding.
good,Working 7 days a week is too much for anyone. The work life balance there is non existent. The amount of overtime is not good for anyone. The weeks never end and moral is always low due to employees never getting time off.
good,"Really decent job, good pay, Some positions are easier then others along with some locations work faster then others, Started off 2nd shift got moved 3rd which i didn’t mind but others might not like that but the worse thing in my opinion was working 7 days everyday week with 2-4 mandatory 10 hour shifts a week, decent job would become tough due to hours, some people have been working 50-60 days in a row with no days off, most management is okay but a few are very ehh. "
good,The people in Dana are generally good to work with.   The benefits and 401 K match are good and competitive.   You have opportunity to work on many projects if you would like to.   Dana support local charities.
good,It'd a job but I honestly could have done way better. Different people from different walks may be an issue if left unattended. Idk. Maybe if the veteran staff or veteran employees get along with newer employees and stop trying to believe them then it could be heaven on Earth.
good,"Competitive, fast paced, stressful at times. Continuous improvement, always changing."
good,"Management became more and more reactionary, proactive improvement projects were subordinated to the problem of the day. Poor training effort on all levels. Appearance of activity was more important to management than concrete results."
good,"Salary ok, too many hours expected. 50 hours a week before salary get any compensation, then it’s only straight time. Hardly any weekends oss to enjoy family life. Stuck on the off shifts and don’t see the wife very often. Our communication is by cell phone"
good,"Dana is a good corporation to work for. The management staff, salaried staff, hourly associates were all good people to work with. Everyone truly believed in what they were doing and had a passion for building quality parts."
good,"The place pays good and has good benefits, but you work all the time.  They worked almost every day for the year I was there.  The job itself is very easy.  It does get very dirty, however."
good,I would set up the test axles in the dynamometer for specific testing.  Then I would diagnose when the test was completed and write a report on that specific test.
good,"Too many promises given and not kept by the company...promised me promotions 3 times and never materialized"
good,Overall it was a job i have nothing more to say about and im looking for a different career path now . but if you like a factory job i recommend this one it pays good
good,"Work is rather frustrating, you have to act like you are friends with everyone in order to get things done, constantly following up. Some people do not want to advance in projects."
good,"I worked very hard at Dana and I met some wonderful people while I was working there  but, my family is important and I did not have many weekends off to spend with my family."
good,"Good experience with fellow employees and the union. Once injured on the job, and after approved for workers compensation, facility continued to point employees if missing work for injury, attempting to point employee out and attempt to fire."
good,"Working in the sales office, first in que for phones, makes it a busy truck down situation all the time.  Manager has since retired, so not sure what it is like there now."
good,I worked for Dana during a period of transition which included a bankruptcy.  They made the changes they needed to make. I hear it's a good place now.
good,nice loots of carry in all holidays and on peoples birthdays . automotive plant so jit was very important. genral motor  chy foord toytoa were venders.alot of machines loud .
good,"Fast pace production, you get really dirty but enjoyed my over all job  there. I learned alot and would return if I could... This job is not for everyone..."
good,"They have several machines which need to run. Typically, a person starts being trained on a machine only a few people know how to run. The leaders in some areas barely have time to help. But things go good if you can pass a drug test, fit within their attendance policy, and have a good first 90 days."
good,My time at dana was hot and stressful. Most of the employees that work there have been there for many years and give no respect whatsoever to any of the younger employees
good,Dana's management was not up to par by my standards. Not enough experience in upper management. Pay was competitive at the time. Benefits was average.
good,This company has been through bankruptcy restructuring since I worked there and the division where I worked is no longer part of Dana corp. so there is no applicable review that I can provide.
good,"Worked there for a while and loved all the people there, the work wasn't bad at all, and the pay was great, but the new manager in training was hard to understand in the loud environment and accused me of deliberately not following a direct order, then singled me out for weeks until my assignment was ended"
good,"I worked with some great people, but found little opportunity to advance and utilize my education and skills. I was supposed to be developing into more areas but found to be very micro managed. I tried over and over to take the direction that I was hired for but met a roadblock too many times."
good,"Very long hours, often having less than eight hours until the next shift.  Unable to have days off due to production efforts.  The company closed its doors and  laid off the newest employees while offering severance pay to others."
good,The company has changed since I worked there. The bankruptcy completely changed the management so I really cannot comment on the current state. Most of my colleges were all let go or choose to move on.
good,Dana Corporate was a good place to work because they provided a union position after your probation period. They Had great health benefits and possibilities of different jobs
good,"•	Set-up and programmed CNC machines"
good,"i had no troubles in the short time that i was there, you keep busy, i was working graveyard shift, everyone left you alone to do your job, if you had any questions you'd ask someone and they'd help you, not a bad place from what i saw"
good,Everyone in the automotive industry  took a major hit and Dana went downhill after that.  They shut the plant down in 2007 and sent the jobs to Mexico.
good,"Company was a good start for me in a leadership postion. "
good,Company provide decent exposure to the overall business but needs to improve on developing and retaining talent.
good,attach Identifying tags to containers or mark them with identifying information I would move the orders to designated areas.
good,"Dana is a good company to work for overall. Safety and production is a priority there. Working for Dana was rough at times. There is heavy lifting, standing for long periods of time, bending and stooping. You are usually in constant motion at Dana. I learned how to M.I.G. weld and operate automated robots as well as use rivet guns. Also they taught me how to grind and rework metal. Management was sub-par, they at times seamed more interested in production and quality than you as a member of the team. It was difficult to work for them, but the benefits and pay were good. My co-workers were great and easy to work with. They worked as a team. The hardest part of the job is standing on the hard ground for long periods of time and bending over constantly. The most enjoyable part of the job was welding."
good,Setup and ran two cnc lathes also vertical machines and broach machine
good,World leader in the supply of axles; drive shafts; off-highway transmissions; sealing and thermal-management products; and genuine service parts.
good,"Average hours and pay. Worked with great people, but layoffs are likely in the winter."
good,"A worldwide manufacturer of commercial vehicle frames, axles and electrical components (this location is no"
good,Is a very good company to work for. They work with each employee to train and grow that person .
good,"This company assembles axles. the work is hard and fast paced."
good,"learned a lot in lean manufacturing, and the toyota process"
good,the work pace was fast but steady. .i learned to keep cleann work environment in enclosed work spaces. The co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with
good,It was a world class Dana plant with dedicated employees and high tech producing Heat Shield for automotive industry.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dana, only downfall was that I was treated as though I had little previous experience (not the case) and advancement within the corporation was impossible - after 3 failed attempts I took an opportunity elsewhere."
good,QC is a must. All lives matter  on or around These axels. This company is a union company. We are the people for the people. The people are the ones who make this product work. Not management. This would be an awesome company if they didn’t over promise and under deliver. With updated machines.
good,It was an alright place to work. The assembly lines were very fast paced. Everybody seemed to like working there. They payed better than most factories. It seemed the people liked coming to work and doing their jobs. I really enjoyed working there until I hurt my back.
good,I began working at Dana very excited about the opportunity and later was disappointed as lack of support existed and escalation was not followed to ensure output and onetime delivery.
good,great/days off/less labor/lots of down time/good people/good bosses/plenty of parking/good money and benfits/plenty of overtime if wanted it.union shop
good,8-8 hr workdays.Learned several management skills and multitasking .Hardest part is 12 hr workdays and low salary.Most enjoyable part is the work atmosphere.
good,Dana Corporation provided me with a good place of employment for almost 6 years. Their wages were very competitive and they hire technical positions from within and promote from within. They also had a good benefit package. The only negative thing I have to say is that they had a massive lay off when Dana Corp filed bankruptcy.
good,"nonstop overtime, no time off for family life. prone to layoffs.  Did enjoy the people  I  worked with on the floor. hardest part of the job was the speed at which you had to get production. was a good place for advancement."
good,"Lots of people worked there and liked the work, but I did not care for the environment."
good,"It is a hard job but has great benefits."
good,"Dana incorporated is worldwide known US based company who design and manufactured drive line like, Axles , Transmission, Drive shaft etc with quality product."
good,The company offers many advantages and is a good job to support one's family. Most of the work is not difficult. Dana offers various jobs in the manufacturing department.
good,"Good Management Bad CEO.  Good work relations with employees."
good,This business could have been run better had the supervisors been able to train employees properly. They should have kept a better eye on the parts ( measurements ).
good,"Clock in go to my assign forklift go to my station, check the books to see what need to be done,start by going to warehouse pickup parts that need to be washed load on forklift take to washing machine wash axle Parts dry when done take to assigned location for assembly."
good,"Fast paced, energetic place to work. Never a dull day. Always promoted from within before hiring from outside. Unsurpassed workplace culture. Great company to work for."
good,Some days were and some were bad. Because when u work by yourself and don't have no help you get back up on what you are doing and it makes it hard on yourself/
good,"Great benefits, pays to work there if you have a family due to the job security one has.  Pay is fair"
good,youaregiven different changes which you have to adapt to on a moments notice.
good,Dana was a hard working just that maid you keep a good an  Tight schedule but my only problem was the 7 days a week 12 hours I never got time to take days off or see my family.
good,Excellent place to work for a single person the hours are long money is great but the life balance is very poor. I recommend taking temp position to see what job is like
good,"Dana was a great place to work,  Each day started with a safety meeting and a production quote.  Management was par at best as the company changed plant managers five times and stability was a challenge.  The employees all do a great job at sticking together.  The most challenging part of the job is the sudden scheduling of overtime."
good,"Show up ready to work.The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. We worked so many hours together that we all became like family.Management was like being led by trainees most of the time.I was not impressed with most of the management.Despite the short falls in management, I did gain a substantial amount of knowledge of the automotive industry and many miscellaneous skills in production.The best thing about this company is that we all had excellent insurance-medical,dental,vision and life at affordable prices.I appreciated receiving my pay by direct deposit.We also had a good 401k plan ."
good,"Keeping production machines running, had very good maintenance and tool room crews. #2 How to be a quick thinker #3 worked well with you, let you try new ideas for the company and people.#4 good people. #5 Being two places at once. #6 Just a good place to work. But ! the plant shut down"
good,"Can be a fun work place at times,works easy and a lot of overtime available if wanted it. Good benefits,401 k available, with the new business. Helps makes for a better job security."
good,Liked the people I worked with.  Fasted paced and friendly.  Loud and dirty.  Nothing really hard about it. I enjoyed working there all the years I was there.
good,Employment was steady and dependable till NAFTA was enacted.
good,Every body was treated fairly as a whole....everybody was recognized evenly I like it highly as far as the pay it was good and my supervisor was a respectful person
good,"Moving up was hard, no opportunities. Management was terrible, always trying to come up with new ideas, bit didn't listen to the people who dealt with the issues day to day"
good,"I’m a loyal hardworking man just trying to better my life , learn new things and provide for my family. I love working in a great environment. Always I love when people reach out to me !!"
good,I liked working here and knowing what I was doing every day.  I liked the fast pace work and staying busy.  I learned alot working there.  Working by schedule.  Team work was great. Everyone pitched in and helped one another.
good,The hardest part of the job was the temperature you had to deal with in the warehouse/factory setting. I did learn a lot about packaging after market auto repair kits and the process to make head gaskets for caterpillar. Mostly the work culture was very cut throat as the older more seasoned employees enjoyed trying to pit the newer temps and new hires against each other. The most enjoyable part of the job was when we were able to pull together and meet our quotas.
good,Great job. Great benefits. 401k . union available. I really liked the job. Lots to learn. Long hours. The pay is awesome but you have to be dedicated...if you can avoid getting caught up in the drama its an amazing job...
good,"Fast Paced, Competitive, Family environment with co-workers, very competitive insurance,"
good,"work at time 12 to 13 hours a day"
good,it is a good job the only reason for me leaving is getting bumped to second shift and I don't like second shift the work in the tool room is not  bad it is pretty laid back not real  physically demanding just have to be good with numbers
good,"A typical day at Dana consists of keeping production lines running including all off line machines. I have learned a great deal about PLC logic, HMI programming, electrical controls and tightening tools. Management is typical for JIT automotive suppliers. Everything is about production and quality. Recently there has been more emphasis on safety than any time in the past. Dana Columbia has a good track record in safety.The facility is air conditioned in the summer comfortable all year round. The hardest part of my job is the continual griping about how machines run and how fast they must run to meet quotas. The most enjoyable part of my job is completing a project and having it di exactly what was asked"
good,I liked it because it was faced paced the only thing that I didn't like was being switched from first to second then back to first and then put back on second. They just switched around too much.
good,"Long 12 hour days 6-7 days a week.  Not a great balance for home and work, but pay and benefits is pretty decent.  Lots of heavy lifting, lots of mindless work and for the pay its not too bad.  Co-workers are typical factory workers.  You have some that are cool and others that just can't seem to get along with anyone.  Overall not a terrible company to work for but be prepared to work."
good,"Dana is a company that has a worldwide customer and production base, but has a small community feel.  Work place vibe is highly variable; can change from tense and fast pace, to slow and dull."
good,"As an inspector working through this company, I was overall very pleased with the entire facility and staff. The job was very simple and the hours were great."
good,"hard to get work done every day, work with cell phone after I leave every day, and work on weekends.  customers are upset regularly."
good,"Good Place to work "
good,"It is very nice place to work there. I have learn a lot not just accounting, but shipping, scheduling."
good,"Decent place to work. You get paid pretty well, but you will work a lot of overtime. The downside is that you spend a lot of time cleaning waiting for parts to arrive"
good,"Lots of work to be done so 8hr days are almost impossible."
good,DANA PROB BE WERE I RETIRE. The co workers are great by most but but like ever FACTORY it has its rough days so about 8/10 days your be just fine. Just keep to to your self for the most part
good,Very fast paced assembly line work great co-workers great managers did not have very much outside lifetime seeing as I work seven days a week 12 hour shifts the pay was good though
good,"You will always have something to do and will work within multi disciplinary teams almost every day. Great work to get experience within the automotive field, but also with the customer"
good,Great place to work. The department I was in was great in that I was able to work alone with the expectation that I do my job and make my numbers. I would absolutely go back if I was able to work a different shift.
good,One of the best places I ever worked your brakes are paid for people are friendly make you feel welcome wish I still work there good benefits good pay and get as many hours as you want and it's a Union facility
good,Hard work. Extreme heat. No longer located in Glasgow area. Good benefits and some of management is helpful. Used to be one of the best paying jobs in the area
good,Dana isn’t a bad job at all. It’s laid back and easy. Lots of overtime. Nice people here and there. I’d recommend this to people. Not too dirty and not too hot.
good,Wonderful workplace culture were people work together to meet objectives.  Common goals are strong and forward thinking but unfortunately management at times isn't always on the same page.
good,"Single customer facility, did not plan for future growth or customer sales drop. They did not account for the single customer dropping 36% of sales."
good,"Great place, facility and people to work for and with.  Changes of a technical nature were the most challenging part of the job.  The part I enjoyed the most was facilitating meetings and executive luncheons."
good,"Ambiente bastante dinâmico, com desafios diários. Grandes oportunidades de adquirir conhecimento on the job."
good,Dana provides an excellent opportunity for students wanting to gain more experience in the supply chain field. The projects you are assigned to actually affect the bottom line and you are treated like a full-time employee.
good,Fun work environment if you enjoy doing physical labor. Nice people to work with and help if any problems ever occur. As a machine operator you deal with an almost finished product and consist of using calipers and gauges of all sorts.
good,"high paced environment, challenging yet enjoyable. Lots of multitasking, phones, IM, email, radio contact with workers on the floor of the warehouse as well as walk-in's."
good,Dana had just established a Co-Op program that entails an 18-month rotation ranging across 3 functions. Every team is patient and willing to coach the Co-Ops as well as help them learn the technical side of the job.
good,Dana Corp manufactures axles for heavy and medium size vehicles. I work on the suspension line where the axles would be brought over after they were built. It is a union plant that has several different types of assembly lines.
good,Enjoyed working at Dana.The benefits and pay were above normal
good,"Good atmosphere with a very working group of people, working towards a purpose, and that was to keep tooling ready and accurate."
good,"Clean plant,co-workers work well together. becareful with the metal can easily cut you. decent pay and hours."
good,I worked nights so it wasn't as hectic.  I ran two machines and kept production where I was supposed to be so I didn't have any problems with management.  There are several people out there that are wonderful to work with and everyone is very friendly and helpful.
good,"Responsible for Order Management, Inventory Management, Freight & Delivery Performance"
good,I really enjoyed working with robots programming them to do new tasks.
good,"overall good place to work, with a clean environment and newer equipment."
good,I was trained as an operator of multiple production lines. I worked in product quality testing and quality control analysis using fluid and hydraulics instrumentation.
good,Dana is a good place to work been with them 30 years ready to move on to something different in my life I would like some more family time is the worst thing I can say about them sometimes you don't get that balance
good,"After going through reorganization several years ago, I understand that they are back ""in the black"" and doing well.  My perception is that they are smaller, but better focused."
good,the place of employment was a good place to work. They had very good benefits and medical benefits. The pay was exceptional and you could work all the overtime you wanted on the weekend.
good,It was great company to work for but the management was way to strickt on you trying to do your job. If the management wasn’t so up tight it would be by far the best place to work.
good,With the little time I work for this company it seemed to me they were very concerned with your safety and safety of others.  They were very friendly and helped out in anyway they could.
good,Work average 48 hours per week fast pace manufacturer. Hard to get day shift. Start as temporary then have to wait 90 days to apply. Good benefits and after 6 months full time get vacation time
good,Great place to work with great pay and benefits.  As a Global Manager was involved and supported two different divisions (LV & CV) over the past seven years lastly with the CV Division.  Aprrox 37 plants in LV and 27 in CV
good,Good company to work for with strong knowledgeable team. Fast paced environment with alot of responsibility to supply products to the highest names in the auto industry.
good,"Nothing to really say, they shut the plant down and moved everything out to ""other"" locations. had a good work force, a great training program and was overall a decent place to work."
good,is a great place to work but no room for advancement.Learned a lot of new skills and the people are great to work with
good,"Working for Dana was basically a good time but it was a job,and that means soom days wasn't that good, especially when it got hot outside, that meant it was very hot inside. but working with good co-workers and learning to operate with different machinery was the best time."
good,"Dana was a great place to work,until they filed bankrupty in 2002 and closed the doors in Feb 2013"
good,Daily management reporting and analysis. Good co-workers. There were no real difficult aspects to the job. Ad Hoc analysis was the most enjoyable aspect of the job. 
good,"I enjoyed working at dana. Co-workers were nice and we worked as a team. I was able to learn and work in alot of different areas such as inspection, machine operator, packager and team leam leader just to name a few."
good,"Dana was a good place to work. It was a Union plant. USW. We worked a lot of overtime, but was only mandatory only one Sunday a month per union contract."
good,Managment could try to be more involved and caring of the employees. Takes forever to get on dayshift just because the turn over rate is low. The pay was very good and the employees are very nice and is very much like a family.
good,It was a good company but the way the point system is set up you will loose your job unless your working 7 days....that's really all I have to say about that
good,Dana is a good place to work. The pay is good and the work is relatively easy.  Some positions can lead to a dead end. You get out what you put into it.  They like employees who are active and participate in the many events they have.
good,"Most of my days consist of preparing machines to be ran daily. Also, being able to problem solve quickly and efficiently. This company has taught me quite a bit in the 4 years that I’ve been here. Management isn’t the best but everyone has their flaws. I think the hardest part of the job would probably be the hours."
good,"Usually pretty busy with break/fix issues throughout the day, along with some projects being worked on."

good,"La presion hacia los resultados en una caracteristica de toda empresa y es esta epresa no es la excepción, todas las actividades y reuniones así como el trato hacia los compañeros es siempre con respeto pero energica hacia la obtención del resultado comprometido, el tiempo es algo dificil de adminitrar y por lo general se toma mas de las horas normales de labor para cumplir con lo requerido lo cual merma la convivencia familiar."
good,"At the time when I was working there, we were working 12 hours per day, Monday thru Sunday. Granted we were making a lot of money with the mandatory overtime however, the job atmosphere was tough. People were tired and very cranky. I quit the job because I was offered another job with a better schedule. If you're a single person, who doesn't mind working a lot of long hours, this job is for you!"

good,"come in get started by moving axles from the line to the N.V.H(noise variation harmonics) back to the next line and keep the line running. the job itself was great not a problem with anyone, the crew was nice the boss was cool. that hardest part was when a axle failed you have to take it apart and get all of the pieces together and get it back on the line. but the best part of the job was getting everything done early just so you can leave if you want."

The management was like most places, there were the people who truly cared about the employees and the company, and then the few who just wanted a bit of a raise with a little power. My co-workers were just as hard working as I had been while working there; people who wanted to do the best job possible, in the time given. The most difficult part of the job was checking the incoming raw materials for quality while unloading them from the incoming trucks in a timely and safe manner. And the most enjoyable part of the job, getting to see my co-workers everyday."

good,"I was a controls engineering intern for four months at DANA Corp. The engineer I worked under was very knowledgeable, easy and fun to work with. Everyone treated me very well and were very friendly. The pay was well below the industry standard for engineering interns. Despite them being pleased with my performance and still needing work done, they didn't let me stay on part time while I attended school. My time there consisted of mainly doing AutoCAD for electrical and hydraulic systems of the plants machines. I was tasked with updating the drawings for these systems, some of which hadn't been properly updated for 10 years or more. I was given a lot of freedom to do the projects the way I wanted and in the order I wanted. The location I worked at was union, so it was a pain trying to do my work sometimes. I couldn't open a panel to trace wires without an electrician opening the panel for me and staying there the whole time. I couldn't even touch anything even if they were there, so it made doing my job very difficult. Overall it was a very good experience, I learned much more than I thought I would, and they gave me an opportunity even though I hadn't even finished my freshman year. Overall very pleased with my experience with them."

El proceso, muy tecnificado y especializado, conducia a las personas a tener un alto compromiso con la calidad; adisionalmente, la cartera de clientes (del ambito automotríz) con sus altos estandares, reforzarían el tópico antes mencionado, ya que los productos obtenidos en la empresa debían corresponder con similar criterio del resto de sus proveedores enfocados en los criterios de calidad y seguridad"

good,"I would provide superior communication skills, and they are helpful in facilitating interaction among staff and managers. A morning may start with advising a customer service team on improving telephone skills.

Making notes to follow up on improvements is usually the last step in advisory meetings."
good,Dana is a worldwide company and supplies several quality products to the marketplace.

good,"Long days, mandatory overtime, and hot work.  Weld all day, working beside other employees. Nice place to work. I just didn't like all the overtime."
good,Upper management was stacked.  No room for growth.  They wanted  new programmers to do their work.  Maybe an ongoing education or refresher course for those people would be best.
good,"A typical day working with part and tools. I learned various things and operated different machines. Management was helpful and understanding, Coworkers helped me learn the machines and how to operate them safely. The hardest part nothing comes to mind. The most enjoyable part operating machines and putting parts together."

I started with great pay, this was when minimum wage was still 10.25 & I was making $14/hr."
good,"I came to Dana with no production scheduling experience at all however, I was an organizer... this is what they needed.

good,"It was a nice place to work while I was there. The office was relatively easy to get to and get around in, despite being very large. Good people who were pretty understanding when it comes to hours. I'd typically get in a few hours of overtime each week and was able to take some time off to be somewhere early on a work day. I ended up learning a lot while I was there."

good,"If I had it all to do over again, absolutely I would. The only thing I would change would be....me and the product of my raising. For years the company had really never changed. It had remained a ""good ol' boy"" company for so long. When it came time to adhere to different rules and changes, it was extremely hard. New laws we're implemented not only throughout Dana, but throughout the USA. All for the better now that I can reflect and see that the improvements were needed."
good,"A typical day at work would be running a press, mixing chemicals and receiving products."

good,"On any given day my role as a co-op would vary. I did everything from running out to pick up parts, setting up tests, test driving vehicles, swapping out and analyzing broken parts, analyzing test data, etc. I had multiple managers ranging from ok to great and I always felt I could go to them to ask for guidance or to get questions cleared up. The workplace culture was relaxed but still professional, which made for enjoyable working experiences most days. The hardest job I had while I was at Dana was also one of the most enjoyable. It involved test driving a new jeep wrangler in conjunction with Chrysler and then analyzing data collected from the test drives. I spent a lot of time going through data from sensors measuring displacement and stress for various different parts and set-ups, as well as swapping out parts and performing said testing on the new set-ups."

I enjoyed working with my co workinger we all made to the fun and enjoyable to work and do the the job. The hardest part of the job was being able to work a head of my team and waiting on them to play catch up. The mose enjoyable thing about working here is that after a day's job I feel proud of the job that I did on making a part know on day it will be on someone car saying that could be a part that I made.
good,I didn't work here very long but the time I was there through the tem service I really enjoyed the third shift crew. very long hours but very awesome job
good,Loved the job but to inconsistent with the shift hours. It was very easy and some what tedious.  It was great money.  Long hours so little time for a family.  Great benefits not enough sick time or emergency time.  Good people to work with but a company that seemed to care less about advancing their employees or motivating them to strive for better.
good,"Good work atmosphere and great coworkers. Work can be repetitive at times, but it was really easy and I ended up losing a lot of weight and gaining muscle during my time there."

good,"Working with Dana was fun, and every time I found something interesting in work. At initial stage, it was a little bit hard but later on I was comfortable working with Dana."
good,"A typical day at work is looking up your pre-made schedule by the managers, then getting to your job. For example, putting together a part of a cooler to be put through a furnace so it can be melded together. I learned the automotive industry's manufacturing system and how I can be a part in it. The management was also good, and taught me my job patiently. When they didn't know what to do or were busy with other things, they directed me to someone who could teach me. The workplace culture was very blue collar with lots of hardworking and honest people who would lend you a hand when you were in need. The hardest part of the job was learning how to do everything at the start with the knowledge that I was slowing the whole process down so that they could teach me. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with and how easy the job got when I knew what to do."

good,Learned to work and train in different areas. The co workers treat you like family.The hardest part of the day is when you don't have enough parts fo fill an order.

good,My experience here allowed me to learn more than the job title meant. Cross training of the department work was helpful. The Controllers I worked with were teaching co-workers not just managers.
good,We worked on machines and rotated everyday. So it wasn't boring. The days went fast. I enjoyed working here. The work was easy for me. I think it is a very good place to work.
good,"Excellent company to work for , learned everything about shipping and receiving, auditing, inventory control very busy work environment being a  Western hub for auto part supplies ,Great workforce to work with we were all a team very enjoyable."
good,"We did architectural woodworking, our main customer was Dillards. We did alot of other stores but Dillards was our main customers. We over saw the customers orders from design to installation at the job site. Not everything was the same always something different to work on whether it was a new showcase design or remolding a store. Most difficult part of the job was language barrier, we employed Bosnians, Russians, Vietnamese, Cambodian's, people from all over the world and at the same time it may have made it difficult at times but also rewarding to be able to bring that many different cultures together to work for one common cause. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact I was teaching people a skilled trade whether it was reading blueprints runnning table sawsm assemblng fixtures, laminating or painting, the people were learning a skilled trade they could take out into the real world. Hardest part was when we had to close the plant, 911 got us, work was not there after 911 and we did not have the resources to stay in business."
good,"Ran machines such as lathes, mills, robotic welders, material handled by hand and by fork truck, inspector, QS9000 inspection of parts."
good,This company has since closed it's doors and relocated to the USA.  It was a fantastic place to work and you were well rewarded for your efforts there.
good,"Typical day can at times be very slow."
good,It was a nice place to work. You di your job that you were either assigned to or placed in. Over all conditions were good. The most enjoyable part of the job was the overtime.
good,"Dana has a great atmosphere. Team leads are wonderful at keeping everyone working together to get the job done. The job can at times be challenging, stressful and difficult but there is always someone there who will lend a helping hand to get you back on track. The only downfall of this company is the amount of hours you will spend here however if you don't mind working 10-12 hours a day 6-7 days a week for $15+/hr like I enjoyed then you won't even notice how often you are at work. The benefits that Dana provides are also great and help make the job worth it all."
good,"-Typical day at work was loading and unloading trucks product and staging area,and dealing with computers."
good,Everyday coming to work was a joy. The people all worked together in their departments. I learned a lot about what to look for during a business audit.
good,"You worked on any machine they put you on. I learned to operate a lot of different machines. The management was not allowed to be ugly to the employees. Most of the co-workers were good to work with, when they were hard to work with they put them with me, because i did my job and didn't say anything. To me the hardest part of my job was the paper work. The machines were going so fast you really didn't have time to do it. The best part of my job was that it was was never boreing. I like having something to do."
good,was a good place to work had decent hours and breaks. only could get hired through a temp agency.
good,"Dana was a leader in teaching it's management new ways of doing business. Lean, 5S, Toyota system."
good,It's a good place to work . The people that work there are nice . The insurance is very good . Most of the supervisor r good to work for . They are a union company
good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, foco na produção com qualidade, amizade, equipe e segurança 100%."
good,This is a good place to work. The main problem is they sold the company and left the area. They did help in relocating people to other jobs. I would work for them again.
good,This is my first skill trade position and I’m thriving to my best abilities things are getting easier and I’m still learning I appreciate working for this company
good,i would actually still be employed with this company had i decided to move to Mexico when the company moved there but i opted to take my retirement and pursue other options.
good,"Working in a factory is a great way to make a living. You work hard to produce parts that go into building cars trucks ATV's boats Semis and Harleys.  that is where I started was building hose couplings for the Harley Davidson Motorcycles.  We made OEM and aftermarket parts for all our customers. Was a great atmosphere, and great comradery."
good,"Over my 20+ year career I've worked at several different companies, mostly automotive and Dana (formerly Long Manufacturing) has to be my favorite place to work.  It's the people and the culture that make it so good, also having autonomy allows you to flourish.  If you have a family and this aspect of life balance is important to you, Dana is accepting of this."
good,I've been at dana for almost 6 months. The work life balance is non existent. You work to live and live to work. But you get paid great and have good benefits and learn how to do pretty much any basic level manufacturing of vehicle parts. The job is very dirty and is not for someone who has absenteeism issues. If you can show up when your supposed to work you have a 98% chance of keeping your job. Mostly work 6-7 days a week and overtime through the week isn't mandatory but you can have it if you want it. Which makes the earning potential even better. Overall if your offered an opportunity with Dana. Take it.
good,During our shifts we manage to get a lot more done than what it may seem like. We often were required to help with our facilities department to on some projects throughout the building. Some projects may have included office moves and furniture moves throughout the office. This made for a very unexpected day and we were never not busy. The hardest part of the job though was sometimes keeping up with the amount of tasks we had in a day or week. With that being said this also was the most enjoyable because  it allowed us to create relationships with some of the higher up executives in the company.
good,"Loved working with Dana Corp. Management were great to work for, as well as everyone hired by Dana Corp. A fast paced job, there was never a dull day. My position was Administrative Assistant, which included all norm office duties, as well as checking for orders overseas, as well as containers coming from other countries, updating records for vessel arrivals as well as in-transit, and orchestrating container palliation. It felt like working with family."
good,Dana was a great place to work. When they moved out of State I decided to retrain in a the IT field. I am thankful the the year that they provided income as well as their willingness to retrain me.
good,"A great company to work for, until the plant where I worked was purchased by Sypris Technologies. They slashed benefits and pay and quadrupled the cost of insurance. "
good,"Typical day consists of working on commericial and off highway axle and drive shaft products.  Through classes, experience, and help from coworkers, I learned a good amount of how each component works, different heat treat process, and more about the different materials."
good,"great job, wish i was still there. i wonder company to work for. plant closure, now looking for a new career"
good,"Muy bien trabajo, se aprende demasiado, la cultura laboral es muy buena. Se tiene mucho trabajo pero sabe retribuir al personal su trabajo."

good,"(No, i’m not a bot or paid to do this. This is a true review of my previous experience at Dana Inc.) As a young single mother, I needed a well paying job with decent hours. I worked first shift at Dana which was around 6:30-4 Monday through Friday. Sometimes they give mandatory weekends but it’s rare. When we first got hired on, we got drafted into weekends. However, long time workers would usually take those days for me. Great place to work and wish I hadn’t moved out of state. I would love to work there again!"
good,I cannot speak for no one else but myself but I'm very happy working here. I wish I would have found this place 20 years ago. Every person that I have dealt with are willing to give you a helping hand. They are very safety conscious on your well-being.
good,"They would help you if needed, and we're always very understanding when it came to needing to tend to your children at a short notice if you brought in some sort of note form doctor, court, etc. The next day."
good,"I really like it here at Dana, its a nice environment and offers something for everyone. I would recommend it, lots to learn about their market as they continue to grow"
good,"I enjoyed the challenge presented.  I was given opportunities to change jobs frequently and did so I could learn more about their production methods and what it took to produce our products."
good,"The Dana division I worked for sourced the majority of its products overseas to support the aftermarket automotive parts distribution.  This provided an extensive exposure to European, Asian, South American, Australian and African supplier.  It also gave me exposure to other cultures to confirm my believe that mankind is basically the same no matter which geographic location of residence."
good,"Great place to work, very clean environment. Also very friendly work staff from operators to office staff. Unfortunate about the current layoff hope to return in the future"
good,If it didn't get shut down I would still be working their. One of the best jobs I've ever had.  Great people and management.  Faced but laid back with a strong union.

good,"My typical day at work consisted of running my machine or inspecting other co-workers parts, making sure the parts were ready to ship to the customer and that the parts were correct."
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho começa pelo diálogo com o pessoal da área e verificação de e-mails, reuniões para ficar a par do que aconteceu na fábrica durante os turnos anteriores a fim de estabelecer as prioridades do dia. Meu trabalho envolvida análise metalúrgica (composição química, metalografia, fibramento, análise de falhas) de componentes forjados, componentes tratados termicamente e materia prima. A busca de melhorias é uma constante, e é realizada sempre com base nas diretrizes do Sistema de Gestão de Qualidade da Empresa. O período na empresa me proporciomou aprendizados nas áreas de Forjamento, Tratamentos térmicos e Gestão de qualidade. A gerência e as chefias acompanham todo o processo de perto e estão sempre abertas ao diálogo. Os colegas atuam como uma equipe unida em busca dos resultados para a empresa e estão sempre dispostos a compartilhar experiências e agregar conhecimentos. A parte mais difícil era também a que mais proporcionava aprendizado: ocorriam situações em que o processo era realizado normalmente e as peças saíam com problemas de ordem geométrica ou mealúrgica, então era estabelecido um plano de ação para averiguar as causas das não conformidades e nem sempre se obtinham as respostas rapidamente. A parte mais agradável era colaborar com meu conhecimento técnico de engenharia metalurgica com colegas de outras áreas."
good,"Dana Corp. manufactured oil filters, I was their Admin. Asst. were I took care of all the administrative duties and some. I initiated a little store that sold products with the company logo, went quite well"

good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, pessoas maravilhosas e com muito conhecimento."
good,The work could be physically demanding because of the weight of the parts. Many hoist or lifts aided in the process. It was an assembly process so everyone knows their responsibilities.  The job was not an very fast pace job.  Really enjoyed the management team because they understood the process and was quick to figure out any issues.  There were always different opportunities to move to different jobs based on seniority.
good,Sector Automotriz con dinámica interesante y retos a diario
good,"Everyone at Dana is fantastic to work with and learn from.  There wasn't a single person that wouldn't be willing to help when needed.

good,"Inicio el día con un café que nos ofrece la empresa gratis, incluso para servirme mas de una tasa."
good,"I worked as a Co-op at Dana for two rotations and enjoyed the work and culture. Many days I would pull overtime to get projects finished that needed to be done asap, but it wasn't so bad because the work environment was very nice. Also anytime I needed help or needed to communicate with other departments its was very easy to do so. The work was plenty and challenging but very personally rewarding. Also the cafeteria is great, which helped on those bad days."

It's a very stressful environment and even when your away from the plant your not ""off"" but that is true with any job. I was given the opportunity to learn a lot about every aspect of the company. My boss ( the plant manager )  was a fantastic woman who stood behind me and believed in me. The only reason I'm not still with this company is due to GM closing the plant in Shreveport, LA. which affected a lot of vendors like Dana. I could have relocated but moving further away from my aging parents wasn't an option. As with anything in life, you get out what your willing to put in. Dana was a good part of my life!!"
