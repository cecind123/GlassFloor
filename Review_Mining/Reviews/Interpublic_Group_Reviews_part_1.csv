rating,review
bad,Its an average place to work. I joined only for flexibility of working remotely for 2 days in a week. Not the best in terms of quality of work. Managers were not very organized and the team was run on personal bias.
bad,Poor management that does not defend their juniors. They also expect you to work overtime everyday including weekends. There was barely enough time to rest and the workload is impossibly high.
bad,"Despite fact that this is a ""public company"" don't be fooled.  It is run by a family as a hobby.  When founder was in charge it was a great place but the next generation could have been given Apple and made it into a fruit stand."
bad,"IPG is worldwide and It is stable in most major cities. The Dallas Weber Shandwick lacks organization, leadership and stability. A lot of major clients left the Dallas location completely like American Airlines. Some other major clients transferred their accounts to Chicago, New York.. to cities that actually get their work done and are efficient in time and money. Due to clients withdrawing their accounts;  the Dallas location lost ALOT of money and thats where the cuts began. Fortunately I left before the cut. Unfortunately, alot of gifted talents who dedicated their careers for years were let go. They even eliminated a whole department and moved to a smaller office. "
bad,This place sucks!  Supervisors talk a million miles a minute and it's hard to take notes in meetings and then they remind you that they've told you something you don't remember them saying in the first place.
bad,"Malheureusement, je n(ai pas aimé le call-center"
bad,"training wasn't completed, overloaded an inexperienced biller with no prior experience in billing with a large amount clients. never gave coaching on how to improve and excel in the position and then terminated after the first billing cycle alone."
bad,"Fun group of people, but no work life balance. You are given tasks that will not be useful at any other job."
bad,Does not care about helping you grow. When times are busy you are on your own. I was let go over B S reasoning because my director had a favorite media planner
bad,"Managers do not care about you, and limit your advancement into higher roles. They are not professional, and lack leadership skills."
bad,"Department is no longer running, but when I was there the department was in their beginning stages. With that said organization and management was not to top level."
bad,"Salary is on the low-end, overworked and management does not view you as a person. Little room to grow and working tirelessly is overlooked, administrators are constantly looked down upon."
bad,Dit mega-callcenter hanteert een uitbuitende managementstijl waarin een normaal mens niet kan functioneren.. Je wordt voortdurend gemonitord en gecontroleerd en zelfstandig werken lijkt er wel een taboe..
bad,"Meetings, interdepartmental interface, project management, research and planning, long hours, close to home, mixed work culture, on-site perks, on-line learning."
bad,"Très bonne expérience au sein de cette entreprise d'ailleurs, je m'y trouve toujours d'ailleurs. Malheureusement peut de probabilité d'évolution. Un état d'esprit multiculturel très intéressant. Salaire peut attrayant."
bad,"Très bonne ambiance entre collègue, boulot en lui même était bien. par contre niveau management, formation, attente du manager, c’était a revoir. Ils demandaient trop d'objectif a atteindre presque infaisable."
bad,"Demasiado control y desconfianza."
bad,Werkuren zijn wat minder en door het werk had ik weinig tijd voor mijn privé leven.
bad,Employees are not very friendly to new employees...very cliquey.  Not very discreet when a person is terminated.  The most enjoyable part of this job is that you can listen to your personal music with headphones.
bad,"je ne pense pas avoir quelque chose à raconter, merci."
bad,"Typical day consisted of supervising press crews to make sure quality and production standards are met. Maintaining the equipment for optimal performance. "
bad,print clearance is not a good place to work - was not treated fairly from the beginning - never was thanked for work actually done. ready to find something different
bad,"Ik heb wel altijd met plezier gewerkt bij dit bedrijf, goede werkband opgebouwd met mijn collega's. Je voelt je wel op je gemak en de flexibiliteit heeft hier de prioriteit!"
good,management will cut a contractor at the drop of a hat to meet that quarters budget numbers. Don't assume you'll be there long despite having a 1 year contract. good luck.
good,"I enjoyed the schedule, and the wotk hours. The work was up and down, the saftey at IPG was very strong, we went over 200 days accident free."
good,"I loved the environment in my department, but did way too much work and had too much responsibilities for the low pay I was receiving. You get a yearly pay raise but it’s less than 15cents every time. Low pay and really no room to move up. You will need a second job if you work here."
good,"Good company, very good location as the nearest train station in 20 meters away and metro station is also 10 minutes away.  with more than 650 employees, "
good,"Les décibels au sein de l'entreprise sont quand même conséquents malgré une ambiance de travail convenable, ce qui peut être stressant par moment."
good,This agency works hard and along with that the reward is there.  You are recognized for the time you put in which includes long hours and challenging work.
good,"Al bij al heb ik wel graag gewerkt bij IPG."
good,"Fire drill after fire drill, no direction or purpose."
good,I would take hoppers and put them in line to inspect. I would put the threw outs in Als and Qas
good,"Great entry level company with good benefits. Compensation is low and job security can be suspect depending on which department you are in. In the right department, it's a good casual work environment. Summer Fridays a bonus."
good,"In terms of office culture, perks outside of benefits package, and the mostly amazing end users, this is a fantastic place to work.  The major (and I mean MAJOR) drawback of working here is the terrible middle and upper management, who don't understand what the techs go thru on a day to day basis, and have unrealistic expectations of what can be done in a given amount of time.  Management as of late has been rude, snide, and megalomaniacal, which makes for low team morale.  If you do decide to apply for any positions here, do so with caution."
good,Good company to work for but very slow in advancement and promoting from within. Not conducive to long term growth. Pay is very low and barely increases
good,"Une société qui pour elle le plus important sont les chiffres mensuels."
good,"Nice offices but not a lot of interaction among employees. "
good,"Good people, good benefits at first.  Lots of merges and mismanagement later. Many creative people who have gone on to better things. Some struggling after losing their jobs after decades of service."
good,"Equilibre vie professionnelle / personnelle"
good,"kantoren en werkruimtes poetsen bij flexpoint bilzen, the crew factory, palmaers vakhandel"
good,"Lors de la prise en charge des appels, il faut être en mesure de traiter la demande du client très rapidement en étant le plus complet possible. Il faut prendre en considération les différents effectifs tout en faisant preuve d'empathie et d'écoute."
good,Great place right out of college but lacks upeard mobility. Pay is not very competitive compared to other places. Benefits are good just not much for pay
good,"Like everything in life it has its ups and downs.  Fun place to work, exposure to many technologies.  Work/Life Balance is good, and very flexible."
good,"Every day is the same. Very busy and stressful. The pay isn't worth all the stress and deadlines. The benefits are decent. Management is best part, but the higher ups put too pressure on managers. Overall not worth working here for a career."
good,"Fijn bedrijf met zeer collegiale werknemers, de werksfeer is zeer goed. Ik heb veel geleerd sinds ik hier werk, heb ik mijn communicatie vaardigheden sterk gemaakt, ik heb geleerd er voor je collega klaar te staan wanneer het nodig is."
good,"The dress code at IPG is great, you can wear jeans to work everyday.  They also give a lot of PTO but you have to use it or loose it each year.  The pay rate is terrible and there is no OT.  In general, management is decent enough, but advancement is often difficult.  They try to promote a fun and friendly atmosphere, but activities were usually scheduled for the benefit of the accounting team which left out the AP and AR groups because they were too busy with month end close."
good,"Zeer aangename werksfeer ."
good,There are some management issues but the agency has some of the best minds in the business.
good,"Très bon emploi, mais comme je préparais mon mariage et que j'étais souvent convoqué à la commune, sa n'allait pas nivaux horaires"
good,Het aangenaamste aan deze job was de dankbaarheid van klanten en de sfeer met de collega's. Het moeilijkste vond ik persoonlijk de shiften en weekends werken. Maar dat is ieder zijn ding.
good,"Managed the day to day IT operations operations in the West Coast FCB offices. First and foremost a typical day involved ensuring that all critical system were always 100% functional, followed by daily IT governance duties such as employee network access, terminations, SOX compliance and Internal Audit controls. "
good,Contract job .  Good while it lasted. good hours. management micro managed
good,"Management doesn't like to promote from within, pay is not comparable to other companies, & they expect way too much out of their billers and don't compensate for it."
good,"Esta empresa dedicada a la publicidad fue mi escuela en muchos sentidos, aprendí a manejar todos los aparatos tecnológicos de la oficina y a mantener la oficina al día. Durante los diez años que estuve pasaron muchos compañeros y en general la gente es muy joven y con ganas de trabajar. Mi jefe era muy generoso y escuchaba a todo el mundo que iba a hablar con el, y por eso estuve tan bien durante todo ese tiempo."
good,I really like the benefits that the employer has and I like that I can listen to music while working. I enjoy the hours and that the hardest part is understanding what I am billing. A typical day is boring because it isn't a challenge for me.I like the leave early and that I have gained time off already in my first 5 months.
good,"Buen clima, trato adecuado entre profesionales y con la jefatura."
good,"Great company, lot's of flexibility..although can be hard to get things done.  Younger workforce and culture. Pay is on the low side, but the # of days off per year make up for it."
good,"Gezellige werksfeer onder collega's"
good,I was with IPG Mediabrands for just over 2 years and loved my experience! They expect you to hit the ground running and keep running.

good,Het beantwoorden van calls kan met momenten zeer stresserend zijn maar het toffe team waarin je werkt alsook de sfeer op de werkvloer zorgt voor een goed gevoel op het einde van de werkdag.
good,"En mi corta estadía puedo destacar que adquirí una buena experiencia como docente a estudiantes de carreras técnico profesional, entregando conocimientos desde mi área profesional. Mi trabajo consistía en hacer clases de hora y media 3 días a la semana, por lo que la carga laboral no era una dificultad. Debo destacar principalmente que, el hecho de que las estudiantes eran mayoritariamente madres y mayores de 25 años, amplió mi percepción de la situación laboral y estudiantil de muchas mujeres, al menos en Concepción, pero asumo que en todo Chile; me enseñó a tener más empatía con las dificultades para aprender que algunas manifestaban por diversas razones (tiempo, el nivel de educación previa que tuvieron, experiencias personales, etc.) lo cual me motivó a querer ser un aporte como psicólogo clínico e incluso educacional en busca de una mejora a nivel educativo y laboral."
good,"When I talk about IPG, I have fond memories of the greater company.  The agency that I specifically worked for was an exception to the rule of collaboration and good culture.  That agency is now no longer part of IPG.  I really wish I could work for IPG again.  I loved working with  the McCann people in NYC and Salt Lake City.  Loved the Momentum people in NYC, St. Louis, and San Francisco.  All top notch people, and the collective cultures of all these locations was excellent, collaborative, and supportive."
good,"Tout en faisant un compte rendu quotidien à mon N+1, j'avais une autonomie dans mon travail que j'appréciais. "
good,"Working at IPG helped me a lot to develop my communication and multitask skills. It was my first job as a student and I really liked it. I think I can say they never saw a student stay such a long time and enjoy their work."
good,heb er graag gewerkt. Qua hulp bij problemen steeds goed verdergeholpen. De wekelijkse inof over je werk kon iets beter toen.

good,"Company pushed walking and had two treadmills for employees to use to help stay in shape, also many activities designed to stay in shape were offered to employees."
good,"Great place to work.  Great work environment and people.  However, our IT infrastructure is located in Nebraska, therefore there isn't any real opportunity to grow professionally."
good,"Men heeft kans om te groeien en te leren in een aangename werksfeer, zeer aangename teamcoaches en een fijne ruimte."
good,The environment there while I was at Interpublic Group was fun and relaxed.  There would be R&R time once a month.  Their moto was work hard play hard.
good,In the final days of my employment I was doing the work of 3 with no additional compensation. I loss employment after the Great Flood of 2015. Some things in management was unfair.
good,"Place for hard-workers and very competitive so you need to give your all. The atmosphere is good, nice sense of collaboration between the departments, and they have some really great creative talents."
good,"No micromanaging, they let you do your job.  Several perks like free breakfast on Mondays and Wednesday, drinks, etc.  Lack of clear direction can be a negative, there's frequently a new initiative to focus on but they don't stick.  Changing priorities can make people nervous, a sense of job insecurity."

good,"Structured Group with clears SP&P, this company has given to me a promotion to USA being my sponsor, besides Interpublic provides me coaching.  Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to continue grown in my professional career."
good,"IPG had acquired JPSA and so the bulk of what I did was sustain the product on our Job Shop Floor and in our International customer base.   Most prominent in our processes were Lift Off and Micro-machining.   We utilized all manner of motion as the workstations we provided were frequently unique.  Robots, Motion, Lasers (mostly excimer), and application requirements.   Materials were also an interesting element in our Job Shop.   The Team at IPG was the remainders of JPSA and they were great to work with.  The attitude from most was, when complete with our job requirements, to pitch in where we could and be rewarded with a learning experience and meet a shipping obligation.  The excimer product common to our applications was large/heavy and difficult to work within.   The reward to figuring a solution was appreciation from any group being supported."
good,"I was a QC officer an i rely liked what i did there, A well rounded group of people that made grow as a person i enjoyed my time there. My Job was to make sure others followd policy."
good,"Good work environment, friendly coworkers and decent hours. When I arrived at IPG I was greeted by friendly faces, it was in my hometown so it just so happened that  I knew a couple of the employees there. The manager took me under his wing and showed me how the machines worked. In a couple of days I had a good idea of how the business ran and what my job entailed. The hardest part of the job was when a machine would break down because this could put us behind in production. Overall,  they ran smoothly for us and we were pumping out product. I really enjoyed our lunch breaks it provided time to catch up with coworkers."
good,"I was lucky to join IPG at the early stage of their IT Initiative.  I learned a lot from working with several senior IT professionals and other business leads.  I was also lucky to support the C-Level executives of the company which allowed me to learned about the business and the ways they were leading our company.  Overall, this was a great experience"

good,Enjoyed having responsibility across multiple disciplines and agencies.  Executive management was very confident and instilled as much within the staff.  Was saddened to have lost our key account.
good,"I managed everyone's schedules, took care of their travel and expenses and did ad hoc projects as required.  I learned the inner workings of the groups I worked for.  My co-workers were very cooperative and collegiate.  The hardest part of the job was getting people to save their travel receipts.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got everything right."
good,"Productieve en gezellige werkomgeving "
good,"Interpublic group is unique in how well they treat their employees. Many events to partake in, food days, group activities etc. management is awesome. It’s very much a work hard play hard environment. Only con was the compensation was low compared to other similar positions. If that issue was addressed I would definitely consider returning. One of the best companies in Omaha to work for."
good,"I can only speak for the Omaha, NE office. All types of insurance at costs less than other Omaha corps. 401(k), profit sharing plan, FSA. 11 days PTO first year of employment. That doesn't include the annual 10 company holidays and 4 summer Fridays. There are also half-day holidays and early release Fridays. Lots of fun workday events throughout the year (e.g., pancake breakfast, health fair, Halloween floor-decorating contest, Christmas party). Casual dress every day including jeans and sneakers, walking shorts and sandals. Kitchen and small break area on every floor. Generous, grateful managers who throw mini-parties (including beer and bottled drinks) and occasional lunches. Company is growing fast but location not sustainable. Employee of the month with bonus and underground parking. Nice facility. "
good,I worked at IPG and its FCB unit for more than 12 years.  Over time the business changed significantly but management was always looking for ways to maximize results and meet the targets assigned.

good,"At Interpublic Group (IPG), I've been able to learn more about some subjects, programming languages, and a few other things than I have in some of my classes at College.  I love how they work you into were you fit best and make working there enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job would be the initial learning curve of understanding how their environment is setup and how it works, but after you understand that the job overall is very exciting."
good,Work place is very friendly and relaxed.My Co-workers are very friendly. My manager will sometimes crack a joke here or there to keep us in a good mood.
good,"This is a great platform job to start out with if your really looking to grow with a company. The managers and supervisors are very nice and patient and I feel like they actually care about their employees.There are so many options here for you. The pay is not so great but I think its worth it. The days vary here also. Sometimes they are slow and some days they are crazy and busy, but hey it keeps things interesting.

good,"We started out testing machinery. It was very long and tedious days at first, but once testing was done we were able to crack open the machines and work on them ourselves. It was interesting to learn about the machines and get to see how they worked. My co-workers were highly experienced intelligent people that were friendly and patient. The hardest part of the job was the learning curve of being thrown into a new environment that was a little challenging with no prior experience in that field, but we were able to learn quickly. Eventually we became a large contributor to their project and team."

good,"I would come in to work at 6:30 a.m and sign into my gun with my gun I would scan the boxes that come down the line. The printer would print out a sticker and piece of paper that let me know how many books and titles should be in each box and where they were getting shipped to. Once I made sure everything was correct I would send the boxes down the line and co-workers would pack them with air filled bubbles. Sometimes if my co-workers needed help I would do my job and help them out also so that we would not get bagged up which would cause us to send out packages late. I learned how to use a scan gun to ship things off and sometimes move things from one pallet to another. My co-workers were every fun and helpful. When I first started working they were so helpful about teaching me how to do certain things. The hardest part on the job was on Wednesdays we had to move at the fastest pace to ship out thousands of books to big companies like Amazon, Barnes and Noble and other companies. But most of all I enjoyed doing my work and my co-workers."
