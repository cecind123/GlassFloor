good,"A typical day at work would be interacting with the customers that would come in the store and be able to multitask doing duties assigned by the manager on duty. You were never bored. There is also something to do. I learned to communicate with all kinds of different people and to improve my time management skills with the job duties assigned to me. I do prefer to work as a team because it gets things done faster. I think a hard part of the job is remaining calm with a busy store and tending to a upset customers needs and finding a solution to the problem. The best parts of the job would be helping customers, knowing you help keep a clean and safe store and hard work is sometimes rewarding."

I learned to do cashiering which I had no clue of; management embraced me because I was eager to learn. In a short time I achieved title of assistant manager.

good,"The management was really nice even when I made mistakes when I was learning. Even though we were understaffed the management let us take a break after a hard couple of hours. A typical day was I showed up, logged in to the register and counted my drawer. Then I would begin checking people out. When the line of people died down I would run to my aisles and stock the shelves and make sure everything looked nice. Most of the time was spent at the register. At the end of the day I locked the front doors and mopped the floor emptied the trash while the manger counted the money. my Co-workers where all above me as I was the only sales associate I know about and even though they were they treated me as an equal and we would have fun talking in between times and helping each other out when we were backed up. The hardest part of the job was probably working the register as they were ancient and sometimes would shut down mid-transaction so I’d have to ask the customer to wait. The most enjoyable part was talking to the customers who all had some interesting view on life. One time the power went out and while someone was wait for the power to come back on I taught their kids how to play a simple game."

good,I have learned a lot about Customer Service and interacting with the customers.... Management is great they made sure that I am trained before they put me on the floor by myself....

I love being able to see my regulars and meeting new faces. I really enjoy the fact that at the end of a customers shopping experience they feel at home."

good,"At any given time you are multitasking with helping customers, answering phones, ringing, and stocking, all at once. It can be overwhelming when you must help multiple people at the same time (ie: cashiering, directing, answering phones), but are unable to do any other tasks assigned to you. At the end of the day, those other tasks still must get done."
good,"Long hours, short staffed, and never ending merchandise.  Loved the customers and helping them make their selections. The hours were not there for additional personnel and sometimes working alone for 5 hours, trying to handle all aspects of the store was overbearing and not as productive as it should have been.  The bonuses were good, making several goals was fun and rewarding."
good,A great place to be part of a team. Learn the in's and out's of what it takes to keep loyal customers. If you treat the customers the way you want to be treated they will always come back to your store. A friendly environment makes the work day go by smoothly and helps all associates have a positive attitude. There are hard days but keep a smile and the hard days aren't so bad.
good,"Great working experience with new and challenging tasks with a great working staff.

The hardest part of the job was honestly not being able to work more than 40 Hours in a given week."
good,"My days at work are easy going not only with fellow co-workers, but also with the public. I have learned to multitask from working out on organizing the store and cashiering and helping customers. My co workers are easy to get along with and also willing to give a helping hand. The hardest part of my job was to work a lot of days without a actual supervisor. I enjoyed my job the most because it has been a great experience for me to learn new things everyday. It has also been a great transition from school mode to working and being responsible."
good,"I was the assistant manager. My duties were opening and closing the store, being shift leader, counting down tills, making schedules, inventory, stocking, and many other smaller duties.

The most enjoyable part was using my leadership and customer service skills."

I learned how to work with the public, how to do inventory, paperwork, how to do plannograms, and how to stock the shelves properly.

The most enjoyable part of my job was working with such good employees and working with the public, getting to meet different types of people."
good,It was a ok place to work if your a college student. I have bills to pay and wasn't too happy with the pay. So if you are looking for a part-time job this may be the place for you to work.

good,I learned a lot about customer service. I traveled many places with Dollar General. I was a smart team that worked the remodels for stores and what regular work hours and cashiers didn't know what to do. My district manager was a great boss. He made working on the smart team fun and enjoyable. I learned the importance of friendships with my customers and co-workers. I also learned to leave your feelings at the door. What ever was going on outside the workplace stayed there once you walked in those doors. You was there to fulfill a job and do that job.
good,Dollar General is all about numbers and following a set route to achieve whats best for the company.  I enjoy the people and the area I work.  Some of the ideas or tasks created by corporate don't make any sense.

I found both management and my co-workers to be professional, hardworking, and enjoyable. I felt the hardest part of my job was working with heavy boxes and cleaning up dirty ares in the store.

good,it was always a pleasure to go to work. from the customers in the store to my co workers was great experience. thing where always in order and everybody worked as a team.
good,"A typical work week consists of 6, 8 hour shifts. All of which required friendly customer service, working a cash register, stocking shelves, setting new seasonal items out in a timely manner. I have a staff of 7. All very friendly people who well as a team. All hired and trained by myself. The hardest part of the job is stepping back and allowing others to do the work you've trained them to do. I take a lot of pride in what I do and love seeing the results."

good,I enjoy counting the money and preparing deposits. I also enjoy running the register and being around people. I have a wonderful boss. my co-workers are wonderful to work with. I must also stock the shelves on truck days. I take trips to the bank to drop off deposits and get change.
good,"Periods of busy work and down time. Occasionally customer service is tested, but this is to be expected when interacting so heavily with the public. Has potential to be a long term job, but not enough hours are given for my position. Overall I look forward to going to work."

good,"a typical day at work was facing the store, working the register, and counting the change fund and deposit."
good,"A typical day is very fast pace with a lot going on around you. You have to stay focus at all times because one small slip to you may be a huge slip for the next. The pay is very good and there is always room for advancement, But with this job you have to be willing,and determined, because if not you will not make it."
good,"Dollar General isn't any different from any other stockman or cashier position. Each employee holding the same title are all expected to help customers select products that best fit their personal needs,"
good,Great employees. Amazing and supportive assistant manager. Very unorganized though. Needs alot of help to get caught up and back to the store that people actually want to shop in and be proud of. They have been short staffed without any management so thats the reason they are behind.

good,"The day would begin as a typical one learned how to order Management was exciting. The hardest part was unloading trucks. the most enjoyable part was stocking, while speaking to customers"
good,"I was a cashier most of the time, but every now and then I would get off the register to go clean up the store (recover) or If need be stock items on shelves to replenish what was missing. I normally worked the second shift so I closed down the store with one of the key holders or managers that was on duty."
good,A typical day at work was great customers was a pleasure to be around never had an issue with the work area. what I learned is that you have an certain time frame to do things no matter how many customers you have you must get things done in that time frame. management was ok there wasn't any communication with employees everything that was told was never told to an cashier by an supervisor it was always told by an supervisor. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be my co-workers and helping the customers I also enjoyed stocking so the overall job was great.

good,"My hours 8-2pm monday through friday and nights on the weekends. Typical day at work was handling the cash register, giving the quality customer service (helping people find things and cash them out), cleaning and sanitation, restocking shelves."
good,"A typical day is interacting with customers to help them find the items they are looking for and the best prices available to them. In addition, recovery of the store is my main responsibility. It is highly important the items are in there appropriate location to avoid confusion regarding pricing and availablity.

I also am resposonsible for balancing all cash drawers, change fund, preparing daily deposits and all daily reports."
good,"A typical work day at Dollar General was very good. You ran a register, helped customers, help cashiers, and help block and clean the store. I learned how to manage a small store while I was there. The managers there were pretty good to you especially the store manager. Never yelled just talked in a stern voice when you did something wrong. Most of the time I got alone with the co- workers. they never judged me. And was willing to help if needed. I can't think of any hard parts of this job. Working there was an enjoyable time for me. There were times I didn't like but not many."
good,I learned a lot working there how to use a pricing gun and checking in the truck and closing the truck learned how to do layouts and stocking the store right
good,My day at Dollar General was stocking freight all over the store. Hardest part of the job was the small spaces to work in. The aisles were very small. Management was easy to talk to . Hardest part of job was finding a place in the back room to put overstock.

good,"get to meet different people each day"
good,"A typical day at work depended on when it started. In the morning to the afternoon, everything ran smoothly. I stocked up merchandise in between comstumers, which was plenty of time to do so. From the afternoon to night, things would start picking up, and then that would be when we needed more workers to help stock things on the shelves. It didn't matter what manager you worked with, because they all were trustworthy, and made sure things got done right. Dollar General's managers were the type that you could go to them and talk to them about anything that was on your mind. The managers there were easy to get along with. My co-workers were easy to get along with as well. Although the store that I worked at was one of the biggest stores in the town, everybody who worked there was like one big family. We fought, and got in trouble, but we worked through it. The hardest part of the job, is trying to run back and forth (taking care of customers, and making sure merchandise got on the shelves by the end of your shift). If you didn't finish your work before you clocked out at the end of the day, you were written up. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to take a break from customers and just straighten shelves and stock.

If we set POGS or stocked the shelves, or even merchandised. Always checking inventory and vendors in and helping our customers. I learned SO MUCH about how a company decides to change policy and how long it takes to change a procedure. My co-workers were always awesome and we could have fun and be productive at the same time. Hardest part was doing the overnights every weekend processing truck. I mostly enjoyed the POGS or planograms when we got to change out an entire area due to new product coming in."

good,"A typical workday consisted of checking out customers and stocking. The best part about this job is the laid back atmosphere. The worst part about this job is dealing with customers that think because they are regulars their suppose to get special treatment. Example: Wanting to buy alcohol and/or tobacco products without an i.d. because they ""know"" the manager and they do it all the time."
good,"Got to store early when I opened, there was not a time when there was nothing to do here. You were always doing something, fronting the store, putting out stock, doing a new plan o gram. Most time I worked through my breaks to get stuff done, as a assistant manager I was on top of things."
good,A typical day at work consist of being there by yourself in the whole store from open until around 3pm because there was no budget. Management I felt really didn't care much for there employees. All they care about was getting the job done which was very hard considering you were in the store alone for the biggest part of the day. My co-workers  were very hard workers but very frustrated at the same time.
good,"A typical day at work involved checking out customers, counting money, stocking shelves, cleaning, greeting customers, counting inventory, and closing store. This was my first job so I received copious amounts of experience. As far as, customer service skills, stocking, listening, and running cash register, and everything in between. The hardest part of this job was when I had to quit because I wasn't receiving enough hours. I only worked one day a week."
good,"It actually feels good to be apart of a team of people who care for the store as much as I do."
good,"...a rapidly expanding company that knows how to do it right. While employed, a manager's life was greatly micromanaged.

good,Working at dollar general was a very pleasant experience.i enjoyed talking to the customers and helping out with the upkeeping of the store.
good,"Working at Dollar General on a typical day, whatever your position is you would be stocking shelves. Making sure merchandise was fully stock, and made visible to the customers to purchase. Filling holes what depending on what was empty prior to ordering. Assisting customers with sales and helping them find an item, if they have a hard time looking for it at the moment. Checking out customers in line while running the register. Making sure there merchandise is bagged and excepting the correct change for payment. Cleaning throughout your shift making sure that you always cleaned a good working environment. Answering calls to verify we have a certain item or what store may have it, if we were out at that moment. What I learned from working at Dollar General was how to set up a proper Plan-O-Gram, from what items that were on sale for the month or season. How to unload our truck when shipment came in each and every week Also making sure you have the correct order when checking in many vendors. The management was ok, depending on what store your worked at, at the time. Some managers had very poor communication, and made it very difficult to work under and for. But overall whatever store you was under at the time, they were ok, but they always made sure to make you better for your next opportunity for work. My coworkers were always friendly, and always willing to help when needed. We always got along, and gave each other all we got. The hardest part about working for Dollar General was sometimes dealing with angry customers who didn't like how our policy's run. Depending on the store"

It is not a job for a person that doesn't multitask well. I learned how to keep people calm when angry and how to appease the customer without them getting upset. Management is friendly, but sometimes hard to get along with. Co-workers ranged from very competent to not so much. The hardest part of the job was stocking on the day of a shipment at 5am. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet new people, make new friends, and to be able to wake up everyday and not dread work because each week was just like the last week and you basically knew what to expect with a few exceptions here and there."
good,"I started off as a Sales Associate. I became a part time Lead Sales Associate then promoted up to full time Lead Sales Associate. When the store is in good hands and fully staffed. Its a great job to have. Staff is happy and customers are happy. There is a problem with staying fully staffed in the stores and finding help to cover shifts. You need a lot of patience, be capable of solving problems, and work under stressful situations with a calm and pleasant attitude. You may also have to lift products that are as heavy as 60lbs.

I gave it 4/5 because I've only worked four jobs and it really was one of the best I had, for the level of education."
good,"Everyone works there job well , if you need to know something , they are all very respectful on helping you , its a very friendly place to work .

good,"Working for the particular store I am in is like working with family. My store manager is very involved with helping each person receive what they should through the store, and if willing to help everyone on a personal level if needed. My co-workers and I became a small unrelated family where as we all know a lot about each other and do help each other a lot. The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers, and working freight. I have to push rolltainers sometimes weighing 1000lbs to the back of the store and unload them in a timely manner which is great exercise. The hardest part of my job is the customer service aspect. There is becoming an epidemic of failing manners in the world and service employees feel the worse of everything. I have had to deal with anything from unruly customers yelling at me because they are having a bad day, to constant interaction with the police due to shoplifting. I've also had to clean defecation and urination from the floor in the store because people have no morals anymore."
good,over all it is a great place to work for i would not be changing jobs if gas was not so high and i lived so far away.
good,"asst. customers, checkout and stocked inventory,and gen. duties"

good,"At this Dollar General you are a family. We take care of each other every day. They have taught me a lot there. A typical day there is always something different. What I liked most about working there are the customers. It's a small town, so everyone almost knows everyone else. You greet them by name when they walk in, and they do the same. You get to know them and their family in no time. You get to have conversations with them, not just the typical 'Hi, how are you doing?' conversations."

My boss worked very closely with me and helped me to be come a great team leader. The hardest part of the job would be all the deadlines to keep as the company is very punctual. The most enjoyable part of the job was having creative freedom in creating my holiday sets. I learned a great deal working with dollar general in being a leader and setting and keeping goals."
good,The typical day at this job and busy and always working.

good,I have found a love for business with Dollar General. With customer service as their key goal it has been the right fit for me for the past 3 years.
good,"Stocked shelves, worked as a cashier, did anything to make the store much more managable, got along with my coworkers"
good,Being in retail is always busy and no matter what the customer is always right. Learned to appreciate the employees for their hard work and dication.
good,"My typical day depends on whether I open or close. When I open I help unload the merchandise from the truck and then open the boxes and put the new merchandise on the shelves as needed. Once this task is complete I go to the register to assist with ringing up customers' purchases. On the days I close I mainly ring up purchases until right before closing and then I will sweep, straighten the shelves, and dump the trash."
good,busy unloading trucks and stocking of shelves. learning working with public can be a challange at times. management was good. some long hours but liked the busy part of it and lots to do

The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people, customers."
good,good team to work whit hard work but it dont take long to do the people that come in is good
good,When I started at Dollar General I was Cashier.We had fun with the customer and associates.We had some awsome customers.They would really make us laugh and glad that they came in.By the time I left Dollar General I was an Asst. Manager.I learned alot about customers and how to unload truck and stock shelves. And how to treat people.
good,"A day at work is upbeat, long and entertaining we have fun but we also do what is needed of us to be done by our managers. I learn everyday at work, that no matter how hard thing's may get we are a team and learn new thing's all through out the day. The hardest part of the day is when it gets really busy and customers get angry, but weall keep our cool and try and help out the best way we can. The most enjoyable part of the day is being a team and doing what we have to do to please our customers."
good,"I enjoyed working for dollar general, I met a lot of great people, and I learned a lot about different lifestyles. We considered ourselves family (me and my fellow co-workers). Even though, i was a cashier my manager wanted me to move up as a lead associate, but i had other ideas in mind."

good,I learned how to be a more outspoken person. I liked interacting with the customers. And I found out that being in charge of 3 or more people wasn't bad at all.
good,"I would arrive at work around five in the morning to stock shelves with my boss and work until two or three. I like being an asset to my boss and I enjoy being a hard worker. I learned about the cash register, the rules governing the employees, and how to close up the store. My co-workers also varied at this job and for the most part, we all got along. The hardest part was waking up five in the morning, but I got use to it fast. My most enjoyable was meeting and helping the customers."
good,Overall it was an amazing experience. Had fun working there had a lot fun. The work wasn't stressing and I met a lot of interesting people in the community.
good,the hardest part of my job was chasing the customer that was stealing our products the most enjoyable part about my job was helping the customer complete they shopping
good,The Management is over all good. They are Flexible with scheduling. I have learned a variety of things working for the company. They don’t give enough hours to run a store for management.
good,Work was slow at times and busy during the weekends. Had a work flow chart to keep you busy at all times. I learned alot how to deal with customers needs/wants. Cash handling is a big part of my job that I learned very well
good,Enjoyed working with the public and the employees.Manager was fired due to cutting hours from clock ins. When he was reported the company checked out the complaint and found cause to terminate the manager.
good,"Busy, checking out customers and stocking when there are no customers at register. I have learned better customer service skills. Management is great to work with and the hardest part of the job is just staying in one place for long periods of time because I enjoy stocking the shelves and making the place look neat and organized so customers can find everything that they need when they visit the store."
good,"It not a bad place but the pay is not for anyone has bills to pay on a regular "
good,I enjoyed my time there. I enjoyed not only the people I worked with but the customers i came in contact with! The store was the largest in the area but you still feel the small town atmosphere especially with all the regulars that came in.
good,A very good job to move up in. Work environment is ok. A typical work day at the general is being polite and enjoying the the smiles on satisfying customers face.
good,I loved working here. My work family was so nice and appreciative. we all got along and done what was needed to be done. I loved all my customers and i miss them.
good,In the time that i worked for dollar genral i felt included and important so it is easy to say that it is a family and frielnly ready organization and the management treats everyone fairly
good,I liked dollar general but they don't like to give a raise much. It's alot of work on cashiers with little pay . Other than that it's good store to work for and shop at
good,Stay focus at any job you get and you'll succeed . You're there for the customers not yourself . Personal life should stay at home . Be educated always.
good,"its not that bad of a job. yes its fast paced and stressful because everyone is trying to get their deals but most people dont start problems. Although, pay is terrible and scheduling is terrible."

good,"typical day was good"
good,the environment was very fast paced. You had to keep moving at all times and make sure you were hitting rate as best as you could. The work is not difficult and the managers are very caring. The only downsides were that you had to endure similar weather conditions to the outside world and the lighting was very bad. The sun always blinded me when I walked outside.
good,Dollar general is a good company. They pay really well and have really good equipment. The manager is a good guy and everyone is really friendly. I had to leave due to a family emergency. I would still be working for them if not for the family circumstance.
good,"During the 6 years I have worked for Dollar General I have learned about leadership, teamwork, merchandising, and having good customer service. Its a great place to work"
good,Its a good place to work at for a first job. I know when i worked for dollar general i was taught how do everything in a matter of days and i was operating the cash register on my own. So i highly recommend for first time job
good,This job is amazing. I loved it the 3 years I was there. The customers can be a bit much considering they take advantage of “ the customer is always right “ saying. But it’s manageable.
good,Good steady job to keep yourself busy n have great pace n patient with customer service n have the items ready for the customer n ready to check the customer out
good,It can be stressful if you're in a management position but my boss treated us well. I had good hours and never felt like they were demanding too much of me. I only left because I moved across the country.

good,"Customer friendly, and love all the customers that were there. You always feel like family. There is a lot of busy work, but you always feel good after you finish it."
good,The Dollar General at the Pasadena store location was a great working experience with a chance to grow. The store manager there was an amazing person to work with and very understanding when it came to schedule flexibility.
good,Dollar general was a good learning experience but it was a little hectic at times. My love for the company overcame it anyways. I would work for them again.
good,"I enjoy working for this company but I do not plan to spend the rest of my life at dollar general "
good,That it is really laid back. They are very understanding and willing to work with you. You usually help customers. What i learned is how to run a register.
good,Good place to work just have be people person not hard to get along with will work with on schedule if need time off or days off not hard job to do either
good,I really enjoyed my experience with Dollar General. My manager was very understanding and always looked to promote in-store. I started as an experienced cashier and within a few months was offered a low tier management position.
good,"A typical work day for a sales associate is very fast paced and a lot of walking back and forth, unloading truck income and keeping the front clean as well as working the cash register and being available for customer assistance when needed. I learned to have better communication skills as well as how to stay up to pace with everyone around me. Management and the work place was very well kept. The hardest part of the job was making sure customers were always satisfied even if it was not easy for me. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people and make new friends and know I have someone I can count on."
good,I like my job here just needing day shift min they Friday and I can't get that there  but it's great place to work very busy no down time very physical work I like that I can move around and help people it is a great job just not flexible enough for me I need a set schedule
good,"I love my job, but I didn't get that much of a pay raise when I went from cashier to key holder. I have to do more work and still don't get paid that much."
good,I enjoy my job and my coworker very much.  My job responsibilities are very easy due to my extensive work experience in this field.  My only complaint is that they promised me 25 hours per week and the company is cutting hours to the point where I only received 15 hours this week and that is not enough to live on.
good,"Work is demanding, but worth it. Overtime was offered a lot. Benefits comparable. Management team was supportive. Advancement available to those interested."
good,"Like my title states, it all depends how much you want it here at Dollar General. If you want to  move up, you need to put your head down and power through all the unnecessary problems that occur while working here and getting to where you want to be. It's all what you make of it, and you can move top quickly if you take your opportunity when you get it. Great place to work for if you love working as a team. Management really tries to work with your availabily and there's always opportunities to work more hours at other stores which I took advantage of when I worked here. The hardest part of this job which is important to keep in mind, is that you need to be able to deal with people, whether it be customers or employees. If you're able to master that, you can be effective and happy as an employee hear."
good,"Great work environment, friendly staff and management. A typical day involves; greeting people, helping customers with any questions or concerns,  stocking and front facing shelves"
good,It wasn’t too bad. I didn’t have a problem with anything except trying to unpack all the containers we got while trying to service the customers as well.
good,"They are generous about giving you time to learn how to do the work. It's not too hard to learn on the go and since it's a fast paced environment, you're always going to be alert of what to do next. The only downside is if you do not have enough energy ready to work so it's best to get that in."
good,My manager is very helpful and understanding. All of my co-workers are wonderful and fun to work with. A typical work day consists of mostly checking people out at the register and stocking  shelves. I have become better at counting money and my social skills have also improved tremendously. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be working with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job would have to be the fact that I have to stock shelves while also looking to see if I have customers at my register. We also cannot have a bell at our registers for the customers to ring when they are ready. I am constantly having to run back and forth from my register to the isles to stock items. Also the temperature in the building is controlled by corporate so it is almost always hot in the store.
good,In all honesty I did enjoy most of the time I spent at DG despite some of the employees showing just how horrible they can be. Other than that the management was nice an patient and I was able to work there for a while.
good,"a typical day working here gets super busy with the amount of customers that come through the door, but if you're quick on your feet its fun and challenging at the same time"
good,Dollar general has its ups and downs . I enjoyed working for Dollar general the pay is ok the benefits are great the help insurance is pricey. Dollar General is not a place where you can drag your feet or slack off.
good,"My job consist of stocking, operating the cash register and giving great customer service to the customers. Always maintaining a neat and clean work environment."
good,"Communicate with deaf people by text or use body gesture."
good,In order you work here you must be able to work with unruly costumers. Patients and positivity is key for you to get through the day. Also never be afraid to talk to your manager about anything that involves your job.
good,"not really sure didn't work there long, but the pay was okay and the coworkers were awesome to be around, they just didn't really do their part at the store."
good,They got a lot of things that you can learn when working with the dollar general it can help you with your communication skills & money skills. I never knew how much I learned working for dollar general would help me.
good,I love retail work even though its fast paced it seems to make the hours working go by pretty fast. You get to meet lots of different people and making customers happy makes my heart warm.
good,"Loved my manager and coworkers... easy place to work, even tho it was unorganized bc of customers constantly setting stuff all over the store. Outdated registers, which is something I feel they really need to work on, bc they are always breaking down, but the environment was good, pay was decent, and benefits ok, you got vacay time after 6 months if full time employee."
good,"Very busy but fun job. They offer a lot of training. Nice coworkers and boss. They are always running a fundraiser of some type, normally a literacy fund."
good,"I worked there for over a year and was treated very well. I liked the job, but my trade is manufacturing and was offered another  job. Had that not happened, I probably would have stayed."
good,I took this job as a seasonal job between my college semesters. I ended up transferring to one of the stores by my college. I enjoy the atmosphere both store managers set in the stores. During my normal college semester they are very willing to work with my class schedule.
good,The Hardest part of the job is  Having a Team Good teamwork Having a good team is everything to a business to keep the business running smoothly. The most enjoyable moment is Making customers Happy to keep them coming Back!
good,I just got hired at Dollar General. So far the people I will work with seem nice. I have yet to actually start work though and have no real idea of how much I will or will not enjoy the job.
good,"Dollar General is a company that you can grow in and advance , I love working for the company the General manager wasn't professional at all .Also  all managers were salary"
good,Great job and great learning experience. Being a manager taught me a lot of responsibility. I met new people and was able to help each customer that shop at the store. Most of all I put smiles on peoples face.
good,Fun environment relaxed flexible and over all a good place to wk. Positive atmosphere where the ability to advance is there ia you want it. Again over all a good place to wk.
good,I have worked at Dollar General twice and I loved it both times. I started off as a cashier and got promoted to a key holder. I was the manager on duty and I would open and close the store. We was a team at Dollar General.
good,A very great place to work not a lot of things going on at once. Pays very well and weekly and management is great . They were very willing to my schedule
good,My coworker is friendly and well put together everyone got along when a project needed to be done on time. The store is always clean. Had some customer that are friendly like family.
good,"Dollar General is overall a great place to work. If the store is smaller than a typical DG, then it really pays off. There is a little less stress than a busier store and more often than not, the employees are pretty cool. Very flexible with hours, in my experience."
good,"Employees were fun to get along with. Management was amazing. Everyone you asked an employee to help you, they would stop what they're doing just to help you out."
good,"This is a very fast paced working environment. We recently got new competition near us so we work harder to meet our sales goal. We make sure that the customer is satisfied, if we don't have it at our store, we check which other Dollar General does."
good,Always have dinners for employees alot of holiday events always giving of shirts or pins to show appreciation we have cookouts even brought in a sno cone truck a couple times
good,Dollar General  is a fast paced environment for its employees it is important to understand that from the beginning.  I loved working with people who are focussed and hard working.
good,the job is good but it's one step up from a convenience store. work alone in store half the day and I have been held up twice. other than that the company will work with you on your schedule. quick advancement
good,"I Had no problems working there , always enjoyed the job an always did what I was supposed to do an was always on time. I would recommend the job to anyone I know."
good,"I had great managers, but the job at times could be overwhelming because the lack of staff. It was a great work experience however and i met a lot of nice people along the way."
good,This was by far the best job I had  met great ppl and worked with even better ppl. I got to learn so much and in return I taght ppl so much I would go back
good,I enjoyed managing the location I worked at and had a great District Manager. If there was a Dollar General where I am now I would still be there. It is a great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed my employment at Dollar General. I loved my coworkers and we always found a way to work together to get all the tasks done. My primary role required me to stay close to the front of the store, and often we would separate the workload by the location within the store"
good,fun productive work place. every now and then get  a pizza party. sometimes you get a break and times you dont. lots work to do and no time to finish.
good,"I like working there alot as a Lead Keyholder. However, in the area which I worked had its problems with crime and theft, but it was no big problem. Could make it stressful at times. Had to take extra precautions. But also taught me lessons in Retail on robberies and stealing prolicies and procedures, which I didn't know before from any other jobs I worked previously. Great experience lesson."
good,The work days at Dollar General usually went slow but it did pick up the pace at certain hours but I would usually work in the back with stocking and shelving items. Also when work got busy I would be upfront assisting other cashiers.
good,The work wasn’t terrible to do. You had to work a register and do everything else in the store at the same time but the pace was relaxing. So no stress and they were flexible  with whatever schedule i needed.
good,"A typical day at work includes:"
good,"I happened to work at a dollar general that was in a not so great part of town, so the customers where quite scary at times. Other than that I enjoyed management"
good,If you’re needing a good spot to start and learn I would recommend dollar General. They offer you good weekly hours and they’ll show you the ropes to running a business and help you get started with whatever you’re wanting to do after.
good,"16 yrs :"
good,Learned a lot at Dollar General. Went to numerous trainings at the corporate headquarters to advance my knowledge in the  corporate world of business  and distribution.
good,Original manager was excellent. Respected employees. Always willing to help. Replacement manager young and eager to make impression. Started making her own rules.
good,"really great place to work once you start promoting and have a handle on things. job is repetitive so self motivation is key, however the culture is that of coaching and helping one another"
good,Maintaining a positive attitude greeting all customers. Knowing where the products are in the store always. Bagging and scanning items efficiently. Handling different types of payments.
good,I learned so much over all and team work was awesome. At the end of the day i left with a smile on my face knowing i did my job right and i was part of the team
good,"Good place to work fast paced, fair management, growing company , fair expectations of employment, would work there again, good advancement opportunities"
good,"I had a month of training to become a DG Manager.  They give you all the tools you need to be a success and other managers to help when needed.  My district Manager didn't have a problem coming to my store and guiding me through things I was not familiar with.  There was constant stocking and setting up new merchandise that was not planogram.  Imagination was a necessity to do this.  I had to run the register when needed, which was often, as well as watching the store and assisting customers.  I had good associates that would work when needed and help where needed.  The main thing I had to learn was how to identify theft taking place.  What I realized is I didn't know the signs to look for and before I left there, I had caught a few people stealing that I would not have expected.  I would work for them again if given the chance."
good,Loved the people I work with. Good learning experience. The customers are awesome. I worked for over 2 years and it was the best job that I had. They will work with anyone that is willing to help them.
good,"In my Role as a Regional Loss Prevention Manager with Dollar General. I have grown in my career with gained knowledge on operations, and Corporate leadership. The work life balance with the company is good, there is some travel , but not often would I spend the night out."
good,"When mangers  was there I was thought count our money work merchandise out we were always busy which I liked, makes the day go by fast also we helped our elderly customers with grocerys out"
good,Work at Dollar General can be fun and other times it can be stressful. The job requires that you work register as well as work truck or over stock. You also help reset planagrams
good,"The manager is great and its a fun place to work, everyone is very willing to help in the learning process. The hours are flexible and the manager is willing to work around other jobs if you have them overall like I said its a good place to work."
good,I worked at a slower paced Dollar General so we didn't get a ton of traffic. It was a nice environment and my manager was the best ! He was helpful and understanding as well. The job was simple and didn't take a lot of heavy lifting
good,Not much to say. It was a great experience I still remember everything I was taught. Most of my skills were learned in my 3 years at Dollar General and all with a very functional business model that made it all the more exciting to be a part of the store.
good,"It was a good place to start as far as retail goes. It allowed me to learn all around how to work in retail on a smaller scale. Very loyal customers, and enjoyed the experience."
good,Not Good Supervisors. Not Working good to the employees. The Hours was not good. Time was not good. Not Safety Meetings. Working on Holidays. Start at 6:00am.
good,Its good place to work if you like retail and enjoy being with people and can work as team...do alot of stocking and cleaning running register front facing the product
good,"It was a pretty laid back job. It usually wasn't completely busy every shift so there was time to put things away and to assist customers still shopping. My manager was pretty understandable about my schedule so I really appreciated that. Pretty much everybody got along and the hardest part I would say, would be not being taught all the basic knowledge for every part of the store so I would know what to do every time I was told to do something. And not having a layout to look at to figure out where things were to be able to help assist customers and lead them in the right direction every time."
good,This was Tulsa's 2nd busiest store and it was extremely fast paced. I lived within a hundred yards of the business so I did get quite a bit of call in work.
good,"Every employer/employee welcomes you with open arms and will assist you in anything you may need help it.  Dollar General is fast paced.  Truck needs to be completed before the next truck arrives, when a truck isn't completed before the next one it can get very chaotic because you have to work faster and harder in order to catch up."
good,Working there was amazing upon my leaving! Dollar General has its pros and cons to it ! The management was sometimes good and bad but everrybody has them day they just have to separated them!
good,"my typical day here was recovering the store, doing planograms, running the cash register and counting money and running reports at the end of the say."
good,"On a typical day, I would usually start by receiving a cash drawer and begin cashiering as soon as I finished counting the money inside to ensure it will be enough. The management overall is very good, with all of them being extremely talented at his/her jobs while still maintaining a generally good atmosphere"
good,They paid minimum wage. Very easy job. Always had to make sure your cash drawer was even all the time. I loved helping customers look for certain items they could not find.
good,It is a great place to work and to learn your store and customers. It was a bit out of order due to staffing but it can be great if gm got on there jobs to help out the store managers.
good,Great job for someone who has the ability to push freight. This job is physical labor driven and can be very rewarding for the right people. The only downfall is half of your vacation is earned after the first 6 month and the rest after your year.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is running totes, the hardest part is dealing with impolite and hateful customers. Management is great, I have learned how to deal with impolite customers, and responsibility.   My typical day at Dollar General is usually pretty good, I run register, sometimes run totes. I recover items on shelves, help customers with purchases, and collect carts."
good,"Good people working with you, the environment is good, made good hours, management was great, friendly people, easy working place, not stressful, clean enviornment"
good,"Not a bad place to work, I learned a lot about working as a shift manager. Working with customers and co-workers definitely helps make your day go a lot quicker."
good,"Normally fast past and easy."
good,"I've been working here for 5 yrs i work ay urbana store and bloomington rd store, always on register involved eith customers all the time my best quality is customer service.i. feel its time for a change ."
good,The overall job for Dollar General is pretty easy and straight-forward. The negative is when you don't receive time off for being sick and getting only three vacation days after 6 months of working.
good,It was a great company to work for. I learned leadership from this company and the workplace was terrific. I learned that a good manager needs a good team to help progress the companies future.
good,"Was the best kept store in Kansas, loved working there. Was only part time and my husband and I split up, had to move for full time to provide for the kids. Had an awesome manager and team but had to leave."
good,"A typical day is always on the go. The constant evolvement is always changing the game, so it keeps you on your toes. The people you work with is the best part of the job."
good,Productive and fast paced probably the most fast paced place i've ever worked at. Great managers and Supervisors to work for along with great pay and benefits
good,"DG is a great company overall, but it depends a lot on Upper management. Overall I had a wonderful experience and would happily go back. The pay is a little low, but advancement chances are abundant and with so many stores so close together thereis always a chance to move forward."
good,"Learned how to cashier and stock, how to do inventory. Management was great, workplace was friendly but usually was so busy never have time to talk. hardest part is dealing with customers"
good,Typical days were fast-paced and I had to learn and be quick which I had no problem at all doing. First thing I learned was how to be a cashier and it was easy and quick for me to learn and do. Management was on top and does a good job. Sometimes I would ask them questions on the register I didn't know and they were always polite and help with anything I needed to know or do.
good,"Opening the store, customer service, store replenishment. Assisting vendors. Review store invoices, cash register, bank deposits, flexible hours fit my life"
good,I love working for the dollar General. The pay is just not enough sometimes. The good thing is there is movement available at the dollar General you can move up on the employment list if desirable.
good,I loved the friendly people that I worked with and they worked as a team. I learned receiving orders and stocking  orders as well as being a cashier when needed. We had great management that distributed jobs equally to employees. We all got along and laughed and shared stories with each other and had an hour for lunch. If I had been able to stay longer I am sure that the  benefits and vacatin time would have been good.
good,"Fun place to work, Customer service experienced definitively helps if working alone, Always watching out for theft, I learned how to stock, top stock, Recover/Zone. The hardest part of the job would be working alone at night on a Saturday or Sunday. Enjoyable part is the different customer personality's. Overall easy job"
good,It would be a good job to work at. I live right around the corner from Dollar General. I go to dollar genrol about 3 - 4 days a week to get groceries.
good,When I started at dollar general I was part time stocker at my 90 days I made to from stocker to a key holder to a assistant manager is was able to learn how to close and open the store I also learned how to direct the employees

good,"Relaxed atmosphere, great learning potential. Company strived to work with my family schedule and was understanding. Really enjoyed working there, no early early mornings and no late nights."
good,Great place to work..  you are able to move up and excel quick with this company.. company is growing world wide so it's a good thing if your planning to relocate
good,At Dollar General I greeted customers and assist customsers by locating merchandise. Unloaded incoming shipments and sorted merchandise. The operated cash register and bagged merchandise. And collected payment from customer and make change.
good,You are the back bone of the store when you are the store manager. I is almost like owning your own store sense you are responsible for everything. It was a great place to work and very fast paced.
good,It's ok to work for dollar general but it does get stressful sometimes and you are required to work long hours. It's a lot of things that the company as a whole should looking into for there employees but for the most part it's ok.
good,I like that time seems to fly by when we are busy. I have learned how to work as a team to ensure our customers leave the store satisfied. All of my managers are patient and considerate of customers and other employees. The hardest part of the job is finding time to straighten up around the store during a rush of business. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers off with a smile.
good,Professional employer. Learned new operational standards for Dollar General. Very productive. Good work practices and good training plans to help in proper handling of merchandise and money handling.
good,"This was my very first job, straight out of high school. I was hired as a cashier but was promoted to supervisor about a month after my employment started. Being the youngest employee and being a supervisor was quite stressful but it was a lot of fun."
good,"Dollar General can be a pleasant company to work for.Personally I believe they need to take more time with all associated not just store managers, just because you have a title in front of your name doesn't mean  your management material."
good,I have been employed with the Dollar General since June of 2016. I have worked at two stores and loved both of them! The management at both were great and all of my co-workers were / are great!! Dollar General is a good company to work for!!!!!!
good,Dollar General is an easy job. You are able to meet new customers. As long as you clean as you go you will not have as much when it is time to end the day.
good,I work for one of the best Store Mangers for Dollar General which makes working for Dollar General a lot better. She is fair and knows what she is doing.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my job at Dollar General. I love the interaction with people and being able to assist them with any needs, questions, and at the check out. Difficult customers are not enjoyable for everyone, but I make a point to make the best out of every situation in order to keep the happiness of every customer and employee. Of course with any other job there are other expectations such as stocking products and keeping maintenance and cleanliness of the sales floor on a daily basis. I have had the opportunity to enhance my customer service and cash handling skills as well. The only reason I am looking for another job opportunity is to use the education I have received in the past four years of college."
good,"I loved the management team I worked for at Dollar General. It was like we were family. No one was left behind, A typical day at work included cleaning, helping customers, returning items back to the shelf, and a little goofing off together. The most enjoyable part about my job was the customers. I'm very much a people person."
good,"we stayed busy non stop."
good,Fun place to work as long as you do your job and greet the customers like you are supposed to... if you are nice to them they are nice to you ...and most of all always smile
good,its a very fun job where you have the chance to work with a great team and get things done. i also like working with all of the people that came in the store on a daily basis. i would recomend.
good,"It wasn't the best job I could ask for, but it paid at the very minimum what I needed.  I enjoyed my time here, and I was able to balance work and personal life very easily.  I recommend this for anyone willing to go into customer service."
good,"There was always only a manager and one cashier on duty. It made it difficult to get any stocking or front facing done and often times the manager had to stop doing their job to assist in checking out customers. Customers frequently complained about the lack of help and it was not the manager's fault that nobody was scheduled. Apparently one manager and one cashier was all we were allowed. It made the work load really heavy and there was never a second to really relax and catch your breath. With poor benefits and minimum wage pay, it's almost not worth it. I did, however, enjoy my co-workers and we did all we could as a team to make sure we got things done to the best of our abilities. Luckily for myself, I like to keep busy, but it was a large workload even for myself who enjoys a fast paced busy environment. I would have held onto my job longer if it wasn't for having to relocate."
good,It's a place to work determine by the location you are at.  Pay is low... It could be raised a little more. You have to be very organized and versatile
good,There were slow days and fast days. truck days were crazy. took a few days to get truck done. having to work around customers and making sure everything was picked up and put on the shelves correctly.
good,Wish I never left the atmosphere was a little down because we are by a retirement home but everything was fine breaks where nice had a lot of favorite costumers
good,I've have been working at this company for about 5 years. It's been a good company to work with. And there is a good environment working there for the company.
good,"I would take the morning or evening shift, count the money in the registers, get my cashiers ready, sign them in and get going with the day. Throughout the day I would deal with customers, interact with them, help, clean the store and,stock the shelves. Make sure everything is ready for the next person to have a productive shift."
good,"typical day at work same statement "
good,I liked working for dollar general because I love to help people. And I meet different people everyday good conversation while I was helping them find what they need.
good,"A typical day at work was okay. we got our work done had a nice day and we didnt have any really big problems."
good,"Dollar General is great but it all depends on your manager. I believe mines was racist, but I still worked hard and when she cut my hours and then I didn't have any I just left. I didn't like the way I was being treated."
good,"Wonderful place to work,  great staff, loyal caring customers, always things to do, full time employees have benefits, decent pay,  wonderful management!"
good,It's a nice business to work for. When you need something it's right there at one stop. The prices are reasonable and affordable. The shipments bring in new items weekly on truck.
good,"This was my first retail job, I loved it! I loved talking to people, getting to know them. Greeting them by their names. I also cleaned the store, help counting cigarettes, helped close the store. I loved the work environment, and the people I worked with."
good,You get to grow and know the neighborhood. Almost know every customer by name. Friendly environment. Team oriented group of individuals who are great to work with.
good,"You have many obligations to complete in one work day. A up beat place to work for, there is always something to due. You stock, run register, mange money, and set store up. I loved the people I worked with and the friendship you build with them."
good,A typical day at work was pretty busy. I learned that sometimes you just have to deal with rude people. Management was pretty good. The hardest part of this was trying to get everything done on time. I mostly enjoyed being able to help my customer.
good,"While my personal experience working with Dollar General was a bit more unique and somewhat of a struggle due to certain specific circumstances, I must admit, the company itself is a great one to work for. They truly give you the tools and opportunity for advancement. I started out in March as a part-time sales associate. One month later I was a full-time sales associate. Less than a week after that I was a lead keyholder. And by the last week of April I claimed an Assistant Manager position. Within two months, with plenty of hard work and dedication, I was able to move that far up the ladder. I am no longer employed there, but in the 10 months which I was, I learned a wide array of different types of skills which I am very glad to have learned, because most of them can be of use at almost any type of job in the future."
good,I really liked my job but I missed my youngest child first steps and my husband allowed me to quite. I worked all kinds of hours and was a cashier and a stock person.
good,"I enjoy the many opportunities you get to have hours but it is very boring and it makes you frustrated to work, there is no hard part in this job, it is very easy and very boring. Other than the co-workers I would have left be now and getting paid 7.50 a hour sucks"
good,This job was a great little job for pocket money it was part time so the hours wasn't really all that great but just to have money to play with it was awesome I recommend this job to youth groups such as 18-25 age range
good,"Typical days would involve working the cash register for 75% of the time and stocking the other 25%. I learned how to handle customer service request and provide information for customers in a timely fashion. Management changed during my tenure, as a particular manager was transferred to a different location. Hardest part of the job was communication in different languages. Most enjoyable was meeting customers who you could over time create bonds with."
good,Dollar General is a fairly decent job for those looking to work for a company in which they will be able to move up. The staff at most times consist of 2-3 people at a given time.
good,"Stocking shelves greeting customers with a smile. I learned that to lead you had to do by example and that time management is very important, I really like the management team that helped support me. My co-workers were great for the most part. The hardest part of the job is finding dependable people to work. The most enjoyable part was the customers. They can be a challenge at times but that is what I liked the most."
good,Coming in on daily making sure everything was ready for the day. Employees laughing and talking at their post; ready for to get started for the goals.
good,Taught me customer service skills and how to handle money and other forms of payment.  Stocking shelves and making sure products on shelves were neat and orderly.  Nightly sweeping and mopping of busy areas of sales floor.
good,"If Dollar General paid more than minimum wage I would still be working there. My schedule was worked with, time always flew by, and it was just a calm environment. My boss was nice and everyone was respectful to each other."
good,"A typical day at work is fast pace and always on the go. You have to constantly be on your toes with the customers and doing your job either its stocking or just recovering. I've learned that every individual is different but you have to treat them all the same, regardless of the situation. The management is good, they basically tell you what you should or shouldn't do and leave you at it,and the co-workers are GREAT! Even though i am one of the managers, i never really had a problem with anyone i work with or have trained. The hardest part of my job is having to ID everyone for cigarettes or alcohol. Some people will give you a fuss about it,but you have to do what you are told so you don't lose your job. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help others."
good,Dollar General was a great beginner's job. Itthought me how to be great at costumer service while attending to multiple customers. I would recommend this job to someone interested in costumer service.
good,I learned to work with different attitudes cultures of people. This was a fun place to work at and great learning experience. The hardest part was catching thieves but it was a task that was always accomplished.
good,"We constantly had a project to complete, customers to assist, and inventory to stock. This job required me to multitask, and taught me to work together with my co-workers to accomplish a task."
good,"This job had to be the most enjoyable job I have ever had. The atmosphere was just amazing, I love the customers that had came in everyday. Overall it was amazing."
good,Great place to work. Got close to 40 hours most of my time at the company. Management was great. Only down side was sometimes your hours could get cut drastically depending on labor.
good,"Helped customers with their everyday shopping, supervised cashiers and opened and closed the store.  This was a great company to work for and it the cashiers were great."
good,"Lots of hours, without sufficient breaks. Poor management communication. Hard to get time off. Work expectations not clarified well. Poor customer service, and experience"
good,"I was taught organization skills, i was given leadership training and job management skills. i enjoyed the public's energy exchange. although they were sometimes difficult."
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General. The management was friendly, compassionate, and understanding. "
good,"I worked for Dollar General for almost 2 years, I loved the company. There is always room to move up and advance in the company.The benefits were really great as well."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General began with merchandise inventory.  After the product was counted the transition would be centered around restocking.  Once that was complete you begin researching labels and community give a way funds for the company to contribute to.  Then it's time for the store to open.  I learned how to manage money for the registers, be organized and operate with in a team to complete task.  My co-workers were very helpful and we depended on each other to be successful in the work day.  The hardest part about this job was there was such a high number of employees that there wasn't a lot of room for growth within the company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was able to travel a lot."
good,Working for Dollar General was an awesome experience! I learned so much about retail in general and that is where I also started my journey in retail management. I enjoyed the day to day challenge and getting to know my co workers and best of all my regular customers. The customers always made the day better and helping them with whatever they may have needed made me happy!
good,". Work 8-5 Monday-Friday"
good,I loved working for Dollar General because I had great employees and a great manager. The pay was lower than I would of wanted but it was easy to get extra hours when I wanted a bigger paycheck.
good,I'm learning the new ways tech. has gone . I've been treated good ( just a lack of working hours ) Everyone I work with seem nice . I just have to learn were everything is. I really enjoy meeting and talking with the customers .
good,"You typically work at a fast pace, and your always walking back a forth due to stalking and checking if there is someone at the cashier stand to attend to."
good,"My typical day included stocking shelves, checking prices, helping customers, and counting the draws at the beginning or end of the day. The store manager quit and the assistant manager and I had to pick up his slack until upper management could replace him. I enjoyed my coworkers company."
good,"I enjoyed this job! I met lots of people and caught on to what was needed to be done pretty quickly. All of my co-workers got along great which created a good and positive environment. However, I learned that you are not always going to be able to please everyone. We're all different but it is important to do anything needed to satisfy our customer's. The hardest part of the job i think was at the beginning when I was learning how to do everything. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to complete the tasks that were assigned to me. Somedays were busier than others and we couldn't get certain things done, due to being back and forth at the cash register."
good,"A typical day is kind of hectic between going back and forth stocking and handling customers."
good,As a college student dollar general is a great place to work and I had a great time with all my coworkers. Its a great job but I would not turn it into a career personally.
good,I never had to do the same thing over and over . always stayed busy so time went by quickly. I sometimes wish I was still there but my father got sick and needed 24 hr. care. But I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason.
good,i ran register and stocked shelves. we always get really busy and sometimes not enough workers working that day or they are busy with their job so some times the workers on the register would get backed up in lines for the customers.
good,"I came in began working on my stocking while keeping up with the cashiering to ensure that everyone was checked out accordingly. "
good,"This company continues to grow every day.  Until I experienced the recent lay-offs under the new leadership after nearly 15 years, I planned to retire with this company.  In spite of lay-offs at the corporate level, they are still expanding and adding 100's of stores every year.  Dollar General was a wonderful place to work, offering numerous opportunities for growth and development.  They provide top notch training for their employees. If there was an area where someone wanted to work towards developing, Dollar General offered countless resources to do so.  Dollar General is also committed to serving the communities where they are located, especially through their literacy foundation."
good,I enjoyed working at this company until I had my car accident. Then things went sour. They refused to give me back my hours and position.
good,"Days can be busy and they can be slow.  Working cashier, stocking, cleaning, and all the way to unclogging a toilet that was apparently unusable for 4 days, with a sign on the door that read, ""Out of Order"".  Apparently, they were going to hire someone to come in and fix the problem but I got right on in there and fixed the issue myself because I feel that things can be fixed if you really put some elbow grease into it.  I'm not afraid to get a little dirty and I also have worked numerous positions which allowed for me to see the not-so-pretty side of the job.  "
good,"Provide Excellent customer service and daily routine of processing vendor's payment voucher, helping the cashier with customer complain."
good,this is a great place it has al the benefits and everybody is nice.  management really cares I enjoy working at this company. it is a long drive for me as I live in Kokomo.  All employees seem to appreciate everybody and help everybody.
good,"I absolutely love this job. I have made a bond with nearly half the daily customers considering we are located in a neighborhood. The only slight down fall is I am in college and the scheduling to my school life can be complicated. I am a lead sales, which includes closing and or opening, being the MOD, and also doing deposits."
good,"My manager would always make sure that out needs came first."
good,Offer great insurance for full time employees. Expects a lot of tasks to be done in a short amount of time. Not enough employees hired to a single location.
good,A typical day at work was fun and easy. There was always something that needed to be done. I learned great management and customer service skills. My manager was easy going and she always made sure her store was in order. The hardest part about my job was carrying heavy items that i shouldn't have been carrying in the first place. The most enjoyable part about the job was meeting new people and getting paid.
good,Co-workers and company team were a great bunch. The hours were never too long but the physical labor was very tough. The environment made the job worth it but the pirate should be increased dramatically.
good,I was a cashier at this store and it was basically the same schedule every single day. I learned basic money handling and customers service skills and my co-workers were all easy to work with. The hardest part of this job was probably having to assist customers that were less than polite.
good,"learned proper loading techniques, how to work with others in a team oriented environment. Management was trustworthy, could always depend on them to offer assistance"
good,The culture of the DG corporation is phenomenal.  Seeing the day to operations and the multiplicity of departments that make up the experience of shopping at a Dollar General store is surreal.  From supply chain management to telecom you learn a lot about what goes into simply walking in the store and picking up a bag of chips and paying for it at the register.  There was a process that made that simple decision possible.  And what I loved most about Dollar General Corporate is I wa a part of it!
good,it was a good company I liked running the store very homey feel I was allowed to make it my store within company guidelines
good,"enjoyed working with the manager and had wonderful customers who shopped our store.It was close to my home as well"
good,I love what I do on a daily basic. I have a great team and that together we try to make sure that all of our customers have a great shopping experience at Dollar General. We stock daily and always have task like new planograms and resets to do. I train my employees so they are comfortable with there jobs also. But with retail everyday is different that is what I like the most.
good,Dealing with customers has always been one of my favorite things to do while on a job. At dollar general I had the privileged of being able to interact with the public on a daily basis
good,"A typical day at work, was very fast paced, considering my location was in a small town, but also very relaxed. I got to learn the ins and outs of the store. I was given the opportunity to be an Assistant Manger, so with that I learned how to do all manager duties, including: Deposits, Conference Calls, Camera Reviews, Daily Paperwork, Scheduling, Unload/Stock Truck, Open/Close Store, Planograms, side wings, Endcaps, and Clip Strips. The management, was very understanding and easy to communicate with. In my experience, the Co-Workers, were very understanding and hard workers. The hardest part of my job was, paperwork. I didn't get the chance to learn it all. The most enjoyable part of the job was, getting to work with great Co-Workers and being able to get promoted to Assistant Manager."
good,Love working with the public. I learned the ends and outs of management first hand. Hands on experience
good,"A typical day was to make sure customers were sastisfied with their shopping experience and making sure my employees were completing their task. What i learned was that leadership is key to running a good store, management was great because we took time to train our employees for success."
good,I started as a stock clerk/ cashier at Dollar General and showed great work ethic and rose through the roles eventually becoming a key holder.  if it hadn't been for a necessary move i might have still been there.
good,"I spent my work days either cashiering or stocking. I was usually the life of the store. I made my co-workers and customers smile, even if they come in with a frown on their face. I've learned to expand my social skills to range throughout all age groups. My managers and co-workers loved me. I enjoyed helping people, especially when I had to work the floor."
good,loading and unloading trucks at time it was hard and hot but over all i learned alot new things
good,"helping customers, stocking, cleaning, a good crew makes it easy."
good,every enjoyable great atmosphere a place where you can advance in a short time
good,the management was alright some of the other sales associate did not do their jobs i had to alot more then what i was assigned which i did not mind it
good,"My typical work day was full off diffrent tasks. From cleaning the sales floor, Stocking the Sales floor, Helping customers, doing register transactions, ordering products, vendors, truck day, "
good,"As long as you work hard, do your job and prove yourself you have a great chance in advancing."
good,I come in and count the safe to make sure it is the correct amount before the other manager leave for the day and i count down my employee till down to switch to the next shift. Make sure that the line stays down to 3 people and if four or more gets in line i go and check out the next customer. Closing i have to make sure that the store is recovered properly and if i open i have to get on conference call work what they call start by putting out labels or whatever items are in sale for that week. Make sure that my cashiers have totes to work on and i have to work on the endcaps or do a planogram.
good,"Every day was predictable, but that wasn't a bad thing! Go in to work, unload trucks, stock shelves, assist customers, ring up customers' orders, perform returns and exchanges: very simple yet satisfying work. I did not learn anything new from this job, as I already had a bit of experience in the customer service world. Management was a bit strict and we were always desperate for more staff as my boss had fired 3 people within less than a week. I was frequently called in to lend a helping hand, which meant more hours and more pay, but also less personal time. My coworkers were friendly, understanding, and relatable characters. The hardest part of the job was the unpredictable hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and seeing familiar faces and always having pleasant interactions with all the customers. It's a small store in a small town, so you know the regulars and become first-name basis acquaintences fast."
good,"A person really has to be the perfect person to deal with the extreme differences of customers. You must love what you do , as it is an extremely fast paced job, mo matter what position you hold.I was on the road with Dollar General off and on since 2004,I am currently in Store #1484--due to the fact the team,Smart Team, was did banded, at present."
good,operate a cash register assist customers stock items and products
good,I loved working there but it is very hard work but it pays off.
good,I loved working here because i love to work in the sales business. I learned how to work the cash register and zoned at the end of the night so the customers could have a neat and tidy store in the morning. The hardest part of the job was doing cash drops because you could not miss count it or you would be written up and you only got three write ups and then would be terminated. My most enjoyable thing about working at the dollar general is again the sales buisness is what i like to do the most.
good,"Everyone there was focused on making the store a better place for the customer. They always smiled when greeting the customer and was always determined to help a customer when ever they needed help. "
good,I loved working with Dollar General.There's really nothing hard about this job. My co-workers was like family away from home.I enjoyed meeting new people and i have learned a lot from working with Dollar General.
good,"Opening the store and counting the tills and safe, survey the jobs that needed to be accomplished that day, opening the doors.  Customers you know coming in to say and shop, kids with hugs, Processing the truck in three days all the while a smile on your face and customers asking if this came in or that. Setting new displays every thirty days!!"
good,"daily duties including,opening of the store,all cash handling operations."
good,"A typical day is coming in, Getting a Till then Putting shipment out on the floor until half way through your shift you stop and clean the store. The management does paperwork till close. My co workers work alright and management is alright. Hardest part of the job is time limits. Most enjoyable is seeing loyal customers. I learned about how to be a manager and how to handle rude customers."
good,I love retail and enjoy the fast past energy that goes along with retail management.  The holiday season is my favorite time in retail. My first job out of high school was retail management and I stayed employed there for 9 years. When I went back for a short time a few years ago for Dollar General I enjoyed it very much. We had a great team and had a blast working together and with our customers.
good,mt typical day at that jobs was going in have our daily meeting go get my labels and do my jobs and when am done i go help out other as well.
good,Dollar General is a pretty could place to start out in retail. If you aren't a manager then you are part time and the hours vary.
good,Best and friendliest place to work. You got a certain speed that you need to keep up with but its easy once you get the hang of it. The co-workers and boss are very understanding and work with you as a team. You get bad co-workers every now and again that just stand around and do nothing and still collect pay from hard workers but thats people.
good,I worked 4 ten hour days and by the end of my work week I felt like I had accomplished so much. We had a really good management team that would help out in the store if we were ever short staffed.My coworkers were all a very hard working group and we all got along well. The hardest part of the job was unloading a semi trailer full of product for our store. We got a delivery weekly and I called it my weekly workout. The most enjoyable time for me was Christmas time because I loved doing the store sets that time of year.
good,"As a store manager at Dollar General a typical day started around 5 A.M. and ended around 12 A.M. Though, long hours the end results were rewarding. The support system that the District and Regional Managers offered were phenomenal. The most enjoyable part of being a manager was the relationships I built with both my employee's and customers. Also, having the freedom to be innovative yet precise. The most important things I have taken away from this job experience would be that the foundation for success is only through educated, goal oriented employee's and a positive environment."
good,Great experience with advancement and superb leadership.

good,"If I get a chance to work here again I would definitely do it again "
good,a typical day at work wasn't always so busy. I learned how to multi-task buy ringing up the customers items and bagging them at the same time. I also learned how to stock shelves and do the inventory at the same time.

good,"My average day very fast pace,having to learn very strong management skills and great customer service skills. my enjoyable time with the company having great workers and hard workers."
good,"A typical day at dollar general would be busy almost every day, stocking merchandise and running cash registers. I learned how to deal with customers and how the store functions. Management staff is very nice to their employees and always make sure work is being dune onetime. most co-workers are loyal and help out when they are needed. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers, but i usually try to stay calm and handle the situation. i like working with good and hard working employees and helping costumes out when needed."
good,"It was an excellent experience. I managed to meet with diverse individuals in customer care and assistance , which allowed me to adapt to others very well."
good,everything at dollar general was very smooth everyone was down to earth came there to work and that's what we did a team.
good,"customers now a days are looking to stretch their dollar. I believe dollar general can fill those needs of the customer, we are located in a good location that the locals and those traveling between counties can stop and find exactly what they need for home, or while their on the road."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General I would say very steady but yet fun. I have learned from running the cash register to becoming a lead associate and everything that comes with being responsible, meeting new people and also interacting with my co-workers and the great customers. The hardest thing at Dollar General, I would say truck day. The heavy boxes and roll containers. I loved my job and ready to be apart of another job just like it. Customers are always right!"
good,I really enjoyed working at Dollar General for what time I did. I had a great management team. They worked around my school schedule at the time when I was going to college. Very Freindly. The pay just wasn't great but it helped some.
good,enjoyed working in health and beauty and stocking products
good,most enjoyable part of this job was the yr i became assistant manager i was mad responsible for shrink loss which i controlled well.
good,"I would go to work and work really hard. I have fun at work, when i do work. I am pleased with the customers and the customers are pleased about how I perform. The management is awesome. They help you out when you need it. There is no hard part in dollar general for anyone unless a person can not work because of some kind of illness. But overall it is worth the work."
good,"People you work with make the job more than the job itself. a lot of the same thing over and over again, but practice makes perfect. everybody does thier part and everything works smoothly"
good,"willingness to get the job done, not one to sit and watch more of a doer, staying busy , keeping things going, get along with co workers , i believe everyone should work together as a team"
good,it has its own challenges strong teamwork focused on proirities and in a timely fashion getting what needs to get done. also recognition for achieving goals
good,Hands were cold. There is all ways something you can learn. A awesome team management willing to work with you. Great morale.I think the coolest thing about it was your 2nd family.
good,"Enjoy the diversity of the clientel. New products all the time to sell. Prices are comparable to other stores. Organizing shelves,  to display products in an eye pleasing way."
good,"Dollar general was a good company to work. Being very close to town was great for customers who lived in town. My managers were very nice and encouraging, they always made sure everyone was taken care of. Flexible hours. Pay is not the best though."
good,"I had mixed feelings about working here. A co-worker wanted the job I was hired for and made any time I had to work with him, very unpleasant.  The manager wasn't able to do much about this because I could never prove how he was treating me. Needless to say the issue led to me leaving the job."
good,"Retail is the easiest job I have had since I started working. The customers are really nice and make you feel welcome when you first start. I don't get paid much but I also don't do a whole lot compared to the other jobs I have had in my life so it's pretty worth having a welcoming place to go to and get paid. All we do is stock shelves, ring customers up, and assist customers when they request assistance."
good,"Working at Dollar General was incredible! I loved the customers the most. My team was pretty great for the most part. We would sometimes come into disagreements and become irritated over how others would work. A problem I had was things never got resolved. Also the pay is absolute BS. Overall though, great place to work."
good,Working at dollar general was a great experience while dealing customers and making them satisfied. Also learning new skills while sticking and keeping the store organized as a worker was great
good,My work there is pretty straight forward. My manager and coworkers treat me fairly even though I m really only a weekend worker. I enjoy my job and seeing people who really never get to see me otherwise.
good,You need a second job. If you want more income.. Salary works for the managers n keyholders.. Dey get the hours and pay.. Meanwhile. Cahiers make the store. Stock. Invoice. Cashier n more. N we get under payed. More work less pay
good,"If you work for what you want you will always advance with DG. If it wasnt for my DM I would have never made it as far as I did within the company. Unfortunately I was persuaded to leave the company and deeply regret doing so. as long as you put forth the effort you will be rewarded appropriately. also, it is retail, you cannot expect it to be perfect 100% of the time."
good,"This is a great company. It has a nice working environment. It could be hot some days, but it’s nothing too much. The co-workers were nice. The company is very organized."
good,Not a bad place to at least as a manager. I did my job and at time's it was stressful but never an issue. I never had issues with Dollar general that wasn't addressed in a timely matter. I would work for them again.
good,Fast pace quick advancement great people customers are great the managers are very friendly and you can get alot of hours if you are willing too work I worked here for more then a year
good,i feel like my first day will be fun enjoyable with the company around helping me how to do things in the positions i do.  once i get the hang of how to do the things i do would be amazing with positive energy.
good,"The store manager is very nice and tried to be there for everybody. Best store manager I ever worked for ."
good,Working at dollar General is not easy or hard. I get to do different things but most consistently do the same thing but its enjoyable. And enjoy the employees.
good,Expected to work at a fast pace with multiple assignments.  Expectations can be more than the hours given. Must be able to leave the job when you leave the store and have a stress reliever.
good,Well we don't stop working we do take breaks obviously not to mention everyone is caring for each other even when I joined the navy they where all supportive for it.
good,Good company to start with to learn and grow. Meet a lot of ppl from different cultures fun place to work . I have been a assistant manager for the company for 3 yrs and I have learned a lot over the past 3 yrs
good,I achieved the knowledge of being an assistant store manager with this company they give you great one on one training to advance to the next level of management
good,I love working at Dollar General. The hardest part about working there is trying stock and having to continuously ring a customer. The environment is peaceful. I learned how to multitask with ringing a customer and helping another customer.
good,It was a very busy job but rewarding to see your work and to see the satisfaction with our customers. I loved it! The turnover was big because people didn’t want to work so our management team stayed busy! We were always hiring it seemed.
good,Busy but fun and the other employees are kind. The truck is mostly punctual so you never have nothing to do. breaks are fairly short but they have a microwave and a fridge.
good,"Becoming a manger is a great feeling. I felt I earn this position, I worked hard and stayed steady. Like any other job it had it’s up and down. Learning new things everyday is something I looked forward too. Interacting with 80 people new faces everyday. I was determined to keep most of my customers satisfied as best as I could."
good,"I was a part-time clerk/cashier. This was a second job for me, and met my need. The coworkers were easy to get along with, and the store manager was excellent. I learned a lot about stocking and maintaining the warehouse. I really enjoyed the customers. The pay wasn't exceptional, but it was fair and met the need."
good,I had so much fun in the month I was working at DG. The work family made it easy for me to adapt and the company was very helpful with any inconvenience that may have happened.
good,Oh yeah and it seems the best time in a long period I had the first two and one I think it will work with me but the way the other team would win but it wasn't really good enough
good,I really enjoy working with all my coworkers. Dollar General is over all a great place to work. Working for a company that really cares about your well being is one of the reasons I enjoy working for Dollar General.
good,Boss says I’m the best in the district with my grocery side of the store I love working. All I care about is my son & work. I love money and going to work
good,"Every day has specific tasks for you to complete, resets at weeks end. As long as you're capable of being on your feet, and utilizing your skills properly, you'll fit right in."
good,"Staff was friendly. There was never any drama. If an employee needed help, help was available. There were always a task that needed done. Whether it was recovering the aisles, or stocking the shelves. There were always customers to be waited on."
good,"I would run the store with one cashier. I would unload the truck pallets, do overstock, backup my cashier, make sure my store was clean and recovered, and i took pride in it. I always do."
good,"Buenas prestaciones, mala administracion, buen equipo de trabajo, manager voluble"
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General very much but over all for a single individual it is almost impossible to make a living. As long as your enthusiastic about your job and you do what is asked you advance s long as positions are available.
good,"overall i was in management getting $10hr and doing every task abailable myself as fast as i could, but for me i just wasnt making enough to get by on"
good,"busy, lots to learn, never a dull moment. good days and bad days. had a few fun and easy to get along with store managers, a constant changing schedule"
good,"I absolutely loved working there. "
good,I worked in a rev5 store with very little payroll. I often worked open to close 6 days a week and sometimes 7. I had two trucks which not all stores do. You cannot fire anyone without going through corporate. They make the final decision and the employees know it. You can advance quickly and make a good living as long as Dollar General is your primary focus. You will work most every Holiday and have floor plan changes about every two weeks.
good,"My day starts off an hour early every day.  I get the deposit ready and taken to the bank.  Then I get all the paperwork done from previous days.  About 7:45 am I get the registers ready and the front of the stores. I then open the doors at 8am and invite customers in.  I green all our customers with a friendly smile and a hello!  Thru the day I work register and truck, I set planograms to book and work to our 7 day work flow.  I delegate tasks to the employees so we can get every thing we need done in a timely fashion. "
good,It was a typical day at work everyday. I learned how to work as a team. Learned how to make my work a lot easier and faster. The hardest part of the job was when it was truck day it was always a very overwhelming day but always got thru the day with an awesome team. The most enjoyable part of the job was always knowing that i can always help a customer and they leave with a smile on their face.
good,"I had a great boss & great co-workers. We would help each other get tasks done even when we would get a shippment that had to be put together. Got to love those. The worst days i would say was truck day, yuk! All the vendors coming everyday, sometimes seemed like they all came at once but all were kind & understanding."
good,Always a pleasure working with Dollar General. Really the only thing that was remotely bad was the pay. My Dollar General was lenient and my store manager was an amazing woman before she left too. We always pushed ourselves to rebuild a failing store and it was working as I was leaving.
good,A typical day was a Maintenance meeting every morning going over what has been accomplished and what needed to be accomplished. I was more of a helper in maintenance. I helped with the workload when the others were to busy on other projects. I also operated two of the balers for cardboard and plastic recycling when needed..
good,"A typical day is stocking new product, going through last week's overstock product, recovering the store, keeping it clean, and of course cashier work. Management is in constant contact with higher ups, so there is always a line of communication. Time management is important."
good,"This is where I learned to be a cashier, how to stuck selfs and how to be a person I wasn't before I was the kind that didn't like talking to stranger or anything and I opened up when I work there it really helped me be sociable"
good,I learned how to multi-task and was able to put my team leader skills to work. Retail management is when i learned i wanted to get my degree in something related to what i have experienced as a manager.
good,"Enjoyed working at Dollar General and seeing our customers everyday...they became like family...flexible hours. If other stores in the company had hours available,  you could work to get more hours."
good,Love working with the people and interacting with customers. They really asked questions that I was able to help them with they needed it where looking for.
good,"Felt like I was doing the job of the store manager for a while. Like I was doing truck solo and still wasn't good enough. Couldnt take too much more of it, stressed me out too much and severely discouraged me. Most early mornings multiple tasks are given to accomplish by the end of your shift and it's hard to do by yourself during the morning rushes. Overall it's not a terrible place, the cashiers need a little more discipline."
good,Dollar General was the ideal place to work at while juggling two jobs. I enjoyed my time at Dollar General. There was a steady work pace but picked up during certain times of the year such as Christmas and Back to School.
good,"I have so much fun working at Dollar General they are very flexible with the hours are really helpful if you need to learn something new always there for you,Do you need something to bear the employees are wonderful to work with the management team is amazing if you ever need help with anything you’re always right there to help me with something if you make a mistake they always there to help you with this company has been amazing for the past three years I’ve been here"
good,"Very helpful at the time, understood my situation, coworkers were very helpful, manager and I formed a great friendship bond, she understood my personal situation beyond work, overall its a great job to have. Recommend anyone looking for a great job dollar general would be the place"
good,"The company is very productive, competitive, customer friendly. Most employees are laid back and some are cut throat. Some managers are kind and there mean."
good,A typical day at work was getting your employees to do there job. What I learn was how to talk and appreciate the people that I worked with. Management was awesome always helped me out in difficult situations. The hardest part of my job was doing stock over night. The enjoyable part of my job was pleasing the customers and making sure we had what they needed!
good,Dollar General has definitely helped me in the workforce and how it is run and established its a very organized company that puts its customers first by giving them savings most stores are not willing to offer it has been a honor to be among the many that keep the store and business running for many generations
good,"Love my customers and my store. Very hard work and not enough hours in a day to preform all tasks. Heavy lifting, lots of paper work. If you have a good team in your store your flow will be so much better."
good,"Dollar General made me feel right at home back in retail after i lost my previous job. training was quick, easy, and enjoyable. They put me right back on my feet in no time. Grateful for the experience and definitely would work their again."
good,Going to work was always nice to see/meet new people was always what I looked forward too. There are a lot of older people that I miss coming in and telling me stories about their families and such. Our team at Dollar General were always hard workers and would help everyone we could.
good,"The job was not really that hard, just maintain the ordered of the store. I also, was Security on the job, I kept my eyes on that were steal.  Take in different vendors for  different company"
good,Dollar General is a great place to work. Management is awesome and works with you with scheduling/days requested off. The job wasn't backbreaking. You see a lot of the same faces everyday and build a strong relationship with co-workers and customers. The hours are very easy to work with so you still have time for a personal life.. I think this is a great place for someone trying to build job experience or begin their career.
good,My manager kept a safe and comfortable work environment. He would teach when ever he could to make me a better employee. He recognized hard work and dedication.
good,Overall I would say it's a great place to start for people new to retail. The pay is alright and they are willing to work around your schedule to make sure you get you time
good,"Very challenging place to work, they have meny activities u can join and be apart of.. they have drawing where u can win things like tv and gift card etc..!"
good,I loved working there the managers were awesome the customers were friendly and kind every time someone called off i was the first person the managers called to cover the shift i had to move thats why im not working there now
good,"I enjoyed working for tis company, I would work reasonable hours and enjoyed helping my customers with things they needed help with in my store . I learned how to interact with the public a lot more and better customer service ."
good,The company was a great company to work for and gain more experience in the retail area. The job demanded retail experience in a fast pace enviroment. The job required motivated individuals that had goals as a team to improve the work atmosphere and manage the daily demands in the retail business.
good,Working for dollar general is really nice its a nice laid back job that's easy to do but the only problem is the hours there extremely short if you work part time.
good,I didn't work here for long just because I needed more hours and I would only work 2 or 3 days a week and only 6 hour days. The hours were inconsistent and were always changing daily.
good,"Its is a good place to work.  You did have long days at work.  Most of the time is 10 hours, but some days were over 14-15 hours in one day.  The manager was a wonderful person to work for."
good,As an assistant manager I was greeted with amazing friendly customers. But because of job requirements and pay for associates it was challenging to run a successful store.
good,"I overall enjoy working at Dollar General, my branch has great people, and great managers. It was perfect for me being a high school/college student, to be able to work and make the money I needed for rent and bills."
good,Job is great...fast paced so that is good for me...mutitasking which again that works for me. I did not want to leave Dollar general I am just having financial hardships right now that caused my decision.
good,"Working for the public can sometime be very hard.But I am a people "
good,"Great place to work and advancing with the company is not a problem. You just have to be willing to do the work which is not hard, come to work and do your job, be on time, etc."
good,Dollar General is a fun work place to be in you will love the people and it gets competitive around holidays but that also depend on what area you are working in but the overall experience was great!!!!!
good,"Dollar General is an overall nice company to work for. It does have its flaws just like every other business. Sometimes the expectations on how they want things done are a little unrealistic. For instance, the cashiers have to work the registers and do other activities all around the store. They can no see the registers at all times. So, if they were to get a customer, the customer may be standing there getting angry. If they were to only limit the cashier to the cash register, this would not be an issue."
good,"Enjiyed working with everyone and the customers where very polite.  The energy was always positive and I got help with everything. It was face past,  and very energetic,  all the employees where very polite and the job was very easy and manageable."
good,"Opening and closing stores"
good,"If you can keep up with stocking, recovering, watching for shop lifters, handling returns, voids, exchanges all while completing a whole slew of other tasks than this is a good job. Pay was decent as was the management team."
good,"If you're looking for an opportunity to advance in the cut-throat world of retail, then, Dollar General is the place to be--at least in my opinion, it is."
good,I  started out as a part time cashier and went to asst.manger in about a year and half .it is fast pace during the holidays with getting the season out.what I seen to be the worst part is getting people to work when you give them the job. Things have changes since I was their so I don't know how it is now.
good,"Working at Dollar General helped me learn and appreciate the time and effort put into a retail based job. While working in management  for 6 months I was able to build my skills in scheduling, organization and Budgeting. "
good,Working at this company is amazing my work skills are getting better my coworkers are amazing i have a outstanding manger and im happy aboit the benfits i get and im over all happy
good,"* Upon clocking in, I would write down the duties the managers assigned me, and get working on it. During and in-between tasks, I would watch for and attend to any customers at the registers. After closing, I would recover the aisles, sweep the floor, collect carts, and dispose of garbage. Most my shifts lasted between 4-6 hours, with the occasional 8."
good,"Enjoy meeting new people every day. It's a challenge,and the work makes your day go by quick. It's never a dull moment working for the company.I enjoyed working with then STAFF I HAD."
good,"typical day at work was cool , "
good,"It's easy to move up in this company. Dollar General wil prepare you for any other job you may get. Customer service/ satisfaction and multitasking is extremely important. The hardest part of the job is time management but once you get a rountine it becomes a breeze. How your store manager runs their store plays a major part in the workplace and its' environment. Some days are more quick paced and busier than others, it all depends on the time of day, month or year."
good,"Works well with school schedules. I am a theater student, when I work on plays I generally have no time for anything else, but Dollar General did a good job of working me in a couple hours a week."
good,The job is not stressful and they work with your hours if you are in school. The pay is decent and the workload isn't heavy at all. If you have people skills then you will like this.
good,I Enjoy working there. They don't give us enough hours for the amount of work we have to do. A lot of pressure and not enough money.WIsh I had more time to do my job.
good,"Dollar General is a good first job type of employment you learn good customer service skills. Must be able to stand for hours "
good,"I enjoyed working with the public. The company had good benefits."
good,Loved working for dollar general had the highest gross sales increase of any store would still be there if it hadn't  been for new district manager we had four in one year this man was just someone that I was not able to work for he had no respect for women was told if he told me to work hundred hours a week that's what I would have to do said embassies things in front of my customers undermining  my ability to do my job
good,"This was a great job and experience, I started as floor support and worked my way up to team lead. Advancement is not the norm, I worked with the company about a year before I actually got promoted. I was offered promotion within my 3rd month at the company but had to transfer locations due to school. Promotion considerations do not transfer. Once I got offered the position, did the training for the position, and started the position it took the company a month before they changed my pay. I had to fight for my back pay just to find out that the promotion was only at the store and not through the company. I was doing the work as an assistant store manger getting paid the same as floor support. Subsequently, I quit. I would work for the company again just not that specific district."
good,"I loved working with people, communicating with customers, and ensuring them a great shopping experience. The staff was great as well as my work experience I got from being there."
good,"consistent work days and scheduling"
good,"I worked here for several years and would still be there, but changes in my personal life caused me to resign. Management was great and very supportive."
good,"Love this job. It's like any where else. If you don't have responsibilities you won't last. First week in the plant. I told my supervisor that I'm going to retire here. I've seen a lot of people come and go, but if your here after two years then your doing something right"
good,It was a good place to work because there's great employees to work with. They have a good work ethic. The hours are good. They were well organized with benefits
good,"Awesome work atmosphere, lots of chances to further your career, perfect job for college students because job schedules are very flexible. It is a very fast paced job but you will get used to it fast."
good,everyday I go to work I learn something new which is very exciting for me because I like learning new things and getting a lot more knowledge and understanding of the place I work in. everyone I work with is very friendly and very helpful. it is a great environment I like and respect everyone that I work with and that goes for every customer that comes in the store as well a lot of them make my day!
good,"I started as 4th key and moved up to 3rd key with that transition, I learned how to open the store how to close the store, and also how to make the nightly deposit. I also learned how to train the new employees."
good,There is always something productive to do at dollar general.  It's usually fast paced and enjoyable.  There are great advancement opportunities.  I would work for the company again.
good,The best part of the job is meeting new people.  Co-workers are awesome and makes the shift go by quickly.
good,"The company is an over all alright place to work at, scheduals are always on time, fast paced enviroment with little down time."
good,Enjoyed the retail industry and loved fulfilling my duties for the time I was there. It was great to interact with with the numerous customers.
good,"I would come into work, clock in and immediately get started. I always greet the customers, help them, help them go through an easy checkout. The management is great. They always help out when I need them. My co-workers, too. The hardest part was trying to keep the store stocked, however. Our store gets so busy that we don't have time to stock."
good,"It's made my leadership skills stronger from training new cashiers. The store that I'm currently at, the team is very strong with one another."
good,This job gives anyone a chance as long as you show initiative. I worked part time and was offered a promotion just a month in.
good,"A typical day at work would include opening or closing the store, depending on your hours, and counting tills. As manager on duty I participated in all areas on the job from working register to going through applications and looking for new employees. I learned how to accept food vendors and stock shipments. My co-workers were great and very social people. The hardest part of the job was stocking new shipments in such little time. The best part was being able to interact with customers and help them get what they need."
good,"I loved absolutely everything about working here they let you display creativity on mothers day or special days by the displays you put up, they let you organize, the only thing i would say is bad is the health benefits are way too costly when they wont give you enough hours and the location i worked at really needed updated computers and software."
good,"Dollar General is a wonderful place to work for. They give you opportunities to grow, and you get to have fun while at work. Great place to be if you love working in customer service."
good,"Fast paced, always something to get done, i learned about paperwork and how to do books, made lots of connections through the customer service, good opportunities to advance"
good,"Dollar General Is A Good Place To Work For Hourly Positions. If You Have A Salary Position such as a store manager or a district manager you will not have much of a home or personal life which is fine for some people, It was just hard for me because I have a daughter growing up before my eyes and wasnt getting much time with her because I was working 60+ hours a week on my store as the store manager."
good,My boss was the best boss I could ever have at dollar general. he had the ability to balance friendship and professionalism in the workplace. I am still friends with him now. The employees also worked really well together.
good,No comments at the moment. Customer service can be a challenge but its easy to get promotion and get paid weekly. But security can be a lot better but the corporation does not want to pay for one.
good,"We picked orders for different stores everyday. You had to get the job done right, fast and safe. You would be wearing a headset that talks to you telling you what to pick and how many to pick of that product. Sometimes you would even have to pick a piece with using a RF gun. When you pick the right product and confirm it you will put it a tote until you get to be bottom of the line and close it up and push it on the line. You are finish with that task and start on another one."
good,the work was great and the people were amazing. The only complaint i could give is hours. you would have some rude costumers but thats always going to be around you. all in all it was a great place to work.
good,"I love the atmosphere its was relaxing I loved my coworkers and guest who came in there daily overall great place to work liked getting paid every week  and having set shifts        "
good,"I loved my job working for Dollar General.  I really enjoyed going to work everyday to do my job and see the customers. I did many things in a day, stock, clean, cash register.  I can't complain about anything. The management was great and so was the other co workers!"
good,"In a typical day I would be at that register most times but I would also be moving around the store stocking the shelves or recovering the shelves as well."
good,"Greeting customers and checking them out was a big part of the day.  Putting out merchandise and ordering items was very entertaining.  The hardest part of the job was receiving freight because we had to handle each box and we had a long run on rollers for it to make it to its destination.  I enjoyed getting to see the new merchandise, it was like opening Christmas presents."
good,Great Work experience with employer and customers. Good training and flexible work schedule.
good,"It was the same as experience in Arkansas, as it was here. It's the same work guidelines."
good,A day at dollar general is truck and totes. Making sure you are staying productive with your products in the back room. The co- workers at dollar general are truly amazing. The management time is amazing as well.
good,I have noticed that I see many loyal customers which helps build great business. The hardest part of my job is stocking shelves. You have to be very fast and accurate while lifting heavy items. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing all of the smiling faces that come into the store and hearing them say how much they enjoy shopping at Dollar General.
good,"I liked my job. I would arrive at the store and take my belongings to the back. Then i would clock in and begin counting my register to make sure i have the right amount of cash to begin my shift with. A typical day at work was fast. Time flies by when there's a lot of tasks to complete. I learned to be more responsible and to use every opportunity to get better at the job. My manager was cool and laid back for the most part. When it started getting hectic at the store my manager would get more involved and would get every employee performing at a faster rate than usual. My co-workers where nice and i got along with most of them. The hardest part of the job was when the store got really packed and a lot of customers are ready to check out. The most enjoyable part to the job to me, is closing up and knowing that you were successful for the night."
good,"it was fast paced the managment were all together, the hardest part was trying to meet the quota... the most enjoyable part was getting off n going home"
good,"I learned to have excellent customer service by greeting and helping customers daily. Learn to manage a store by receiving merchandise, collecting, counting, and depositing money, stocking and keeping a clean work and shopping environment.  The hardest part of the job was being short staffed and a lot of work to be done. I worked well with my co-workers and had a lot of fun doing so."
good,"My typical day at dg, was hard work,but also fun ,because I new my job,i knew what my superviser expected out of me. what I learned,working as a team ,gets a whole lot done, then working by yourself.managemt, I must say I worked with a great group of people. The hardest part of the job I must say is, getting behind, or having big orders.The most enjoyable part of my the job, is going home to my wife an kids."
good,"Overall, Dollar General is a great place to work. A typical day would be to unload a delivery truck, stock and help customers."
good,Fun job. Has many advancement opportunities. Hated to leave. Will explain if necessary
good,"I rather enjoyed working with the folks at Dollar General Stores because the people were friendly and it made the job go by faster.  "
good,A typical day at work would consist of making sure store is in appearence order and floors are nice kept. I learned how to make a schedule.
good,"Enjoyed my time there,People are fun and something new everyday"
good,"Whether I worked an opening shift or a closing shift I was always able to find something to do, which is a good thing because having nothing to do at work isn't an enjoyable experience for someone that likes to stay busy like myself. The management was straightforward with me and my co-workers were easy to work alongside. Most of the time the hardest part about the job was finding time off because at the particular store I worked at I got called in a lot since it was busy fairly often."
good,"Typical day would include putting out stock, working the cash register and assisting customers or supervisors. From me being there, I have learned leadership skills and it helped me gain confidence as a manager. The job is fairly easy as you go along the days, then you notice your regulars and how they can brighten up your day. I would probably say the hardest part is when there are difficult customers who challenge us."
good,"Management was great."
good,I am currently leading my district in store sales at 5% above my sales plan. I have reduced shrink. Constantly training and teaching employees and team.  Set my team up for success so we can all succeed together.
good,Dollar general provides great jobs to the working class. While there I have come to think of my co-workers as family. As you work at Dollar General you come to have a connection with the reoccurring customers and tend to make their experience less of a store and more like a place to talk and converse.
good,DG is a good place to work. Management was good at my store. I learned great customer skills. Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Worst part was having to stock and do 20 other things at once. Fast paced place. Could pay more for full time employees for ALL they do.
good,"My second favorite job because I was management and was able to do the harder, more complicated work. Management was great. I got to know my fellow employees good. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking, and opening and closing the store. The hardest part was my favorite part though, which was all the paperwork and cash balancing."
good,"open store,set up registers review the days tasks to be done an hand out work assignments, do plan-o-grams for end cap change outs, put out freight, help customers, run registers, report to closing MOD what has been done and what still (if any) needs to be done,"
good,I I learned how to work a cash register and stock that is appropriate with the work place. The hardest thing is working with employers because everyone has there ideas on how the store should be ran. I loved my coworkers because everyone had there on personalities. I enjoyed my customers because they made conversation and i always had an affect on individuals.
good,"A typical day at wor for me involves a little bit of everything as far as retail goes, stocking shelves doing planograms, money handling tending to customers and employees. i like pretty much everyone i work with there is a couple people i dont care for much but it doesnt affect my work or the way i treat them. The hardest part of my job is probly having to do 3-5 things at once or sometimes keeping the public that comes in happy. What i like most here is its definantly job security and im pretty much my own boss when i work."
good,A fast paced business office enviorment. Great place to work. Some departmental goals are not reasonable.
good,helping workers and customers enjoyable.unloading trucks with crew fun.
good,"Iv'e enjoyed ever minute that I workred for DollarGeneral the company has taught me alot, Iv'e enjoyed all of the people that I have hired and trainned ,I did not have a turn over in my store, those I have hired stayed, we became a family over time. There was no hardest part of the job, because we all worked hard when we needed to and we all worked together as a T E A M, which may it enjoyable."

good,There is always room for advancement at Dollar General.  I worked there for four years because they were very flexible with my school hours.  I could come in after school or before and work on weekends.
good,I loved my job here just felt like I didn't get paid enough to be an assistant manager pretty much being a store manager being she always called in. fun enviroment
good,My boss gives me great support. When I need anything she will go out her way to find it. The hardest part of the day is when you are by yourself for the whole and can not get anything done.
good,I worked at two different locations. The one in Denver was not as busy. The building was old and smelly. The other location in New Mexico was in a really dark location and has been robbed more than once. Did not always feel safe.
good,I enjoyed working there. I got in fast. I moved up to the manager position fast. I got to travel and do work for different dollar stores which I enjoyed and I learned alot while working there.
good,"A typical day at work involved me stocking, cashiering, janitorial work, using my customer service skills to dilute any problems and closing the store which included counting deposit, and making sure everything was good the the next day."
good,It's usually a day of taking care of merchandise that comes on truck. Making sure everything is neat and nice for customers. The managment is awesome.

good,"Good people, great service! Successful atmosphere, unfortunately I couldn't continue. Though, I'd definitely come back!"
good,Employees are friendly and helpful. Everyone works as a team. Manager notices and gives compliments when jobs are complete in a timely manner. Good place to work if going to school. Overall good place to work.
good,Management has a strong belief to see employees happy and willing to discuss possible ways to improve in employee satisfaction. Includes benefits such as school and relaxed dress code.
good,I loved working for this company most of the six years I was there. If you have the right boss it’s an amazing place to work. Things can get hectic like any other place but I enjoyed the challenges.
good,If you get a good team it's awesome place to work. I currently have a great team at my location and wouldn't trade them. My store manager is amazing and the best I ever worked with.

good,overall was a easy job i love working with people anyway. only hard part was climbing to the top of the selves cause im so short . as long as you stay busy the job want get boring because there always something to do stock or clean up.
good,"Open availability will always be your best option if trying to advance!! Training is always available, there’s is always room for growth if your willing to learn."

good,Need to allow more individual work hours per week. Definitely need to have more training for the assigned positions and need to know information overall.
good,"In a typical work day things went pretty smooth. Usually the first half was spent stocking and the second half was spent running the registers. management there was pretty good, very nice and the workplace was very professional. The hardest thing that I usually dealt with was a recalled item that didn't get taken off the shelves but otherwise customers and my coworkers where very nice."
good,I love my job and if you like being flexible and you like people you will love your job also. Long as you come to work and do your job you will climb the latter before u know
good,"My responsibility was to make sure  The store was clean make sure  when we leave, the store is in good shape for when the person in the morning opens the store."
good,This lead job was a very great experience it taught me to take control and get your job done on tim. it also taught me that no matter what you always have a job to do
good,"We was always busy, but that is the point of a job. The work was hard, but we would get it completed. Hardest part was  having a lot of overstocked goods."
good,Great for part time work. great for students great people to work with very fun environment. It's not the type of jobto manage a household unless you're in upper management.
good,super busy always something to do. some customers with coupons can get very demanding when not allowed to use them as they want.if you want the hours and do the job right they will give you them
good,"I loved working at Dollar General. If it weren't for my moving away, I would have stayed much longer. I genuinely liked my managers and the people I worked with."
good,Nice place to work. The hours were inconsistent though. It was okay because I wasn't married and didn't have kids. The management was okay. It wouldnt hurt to smile and tell your team thank you and that you appreciate them once in a while. Little things like this mean the world
good,The most enjoyable part about the job is training and developing employees and learning new strategies. The hardest part about the job is there is no work/life balance
good,I hate working here alot.. it was really boreding.the manger was not good at all.the hour are not great at all. The other worker are not nice's at all.
good,"Highly enjoyed working there, I took pride working at Dollar General had an excellent store manager,excellent teamwork,Enjoyable atmosphere,good people."
good,"Fun days on occasions,people try to frustrate you if u let them,all about customer courtesy.Operated smoothly.Nothing hard about the job as long as you get the job done."
good,"The manager is always on top of having everything completed on time and efficiently. They make the environment feel welcoming and always ensures that their employees feel safe working. We're not just a bunch of employees working together, we're a family."
good,I would do it again. They stayed busy and worked with my hours. We always finished the truck in two days which was fantastic. Loved how they ran the place
good,All the people that I worked with were pretty great. The management at my store was awesome that kept a good flow throughout the day of getting things done. They also expected it to stay that way which I liked. Our store was always clean and stocked which made it better to come to work.
good,"A typical day consisted of greeting and checking out customers. Stocking and cleaning while not busy. I truly enjoyed management. I felt like if there was anything I needed to make my job easier they were there to help. They answered all of mine and the customers questions. The workplace culture was easy going, as long as you did your job there was nothing to worry about. Sometimes it would get hectic, but the managers helped. The most enjoyable part of the day was being able to talk to the customers and help them."
good,"Work day consists of touring your store before opening and setting notes that need to be done throughout the day. "
good,It's a good good production job to work at . Everyone work there end up being like family . Everyone work together good working on stock . They really are team work
good,"The manager us very kind and has no issue working with you to make you job there as good a s possible. Breaks are not scheduled but manditory unpaid. Dollar general in augusta has their own family with the customers that arrive, the vendors, and your co workers."
good,Very easy simple job. Unless your dumb or lazy. Not hard to make production at all. Easy job to keep and hard job to loose. As long as you come to work.
good,"Hired and trained all sales staff for new store location. Created and directed sales team"
good,i liked working at the dollar store friendly staff nice breaks. The hardest part was probably stocking. It was fun socializing with the customers and nice staff.
good,"Dollar General is a good company to work for.  I advanced pretty quickly while there.  I learned a lot about merchandise and how to stock.  The pay isn't that great, but who really pays in retail."
good,"My overall experience while at dollar general was mostly all good. Some days were better then others, but there's always those kind of days in any job you have. Typical day at work was either really busy, dead, or spurts throughout the day."
good,"I loved the people I worked with, everyone pitched in and we all helped each other. I moved up quickly into management.  It was hard work keeping up the store but when you do all the hard work then look back with pride it was all worth it."
good,"Must have the ability to work long long hours. Good customer service, retail experience and transportation is a must. The ability to stand for th long hours and work days your suppose to be off."
good,"I started from the bottom with this company as a cashier and moved my way up to management. great company to grow with. I loved the fact it was a very active job and got to move around constantly. I like working with the public and with the job i had a lot of regular customers i would see everyday and liked that as well. we were a corporate store so we would have what they called visits from the ceo and other important people from corporate. which could be stressful but they were usually pleased, these visits would tend to cause longer and stressful days for every manager."
good,"It's a cool place too work at and everyone there is a team player ,everyone looks out for one another and it's always room for improvement too move up."
good,"I loved this job Because I love working in retail and with customers. My customers are what made the job for me. When I became a manager I loved it even more though, because my creative side was able to come out a little more with the different seasonal decors we got to experience with."
good,Good opportunity for advancement at this company. I started as start-up crew opening a new store and in less than three months was promoted to assistant manager. Would recommend if you are interested in advancement opportunities.
good,"Great  company to work for. Nice,clean and friendly customers and associates. Some times I had long day but they were still good days. Working in the public you learn the customer is always right and if not for they you would not get a pay check. Very Diverse company. I enjoyed managing people and keeping a safe and clean working environment."
good,Very balanced work place. Nice amount of minutes per break time. Very productive job. Nice friendly environment. Management is A+ 12 hour shifts are worth it.
good,"Surrounded by friendly employees who work together to reach corporate and store objectives. Work isn't strenuous! Must be able to clean, work cashier!"
good,"open and closed the store, cashier, manager at the store, inventory the store, bank deposit, customer service, schedule the employees, unload the morning truck."
good,The work day was tiring and hard yet satisfying. I was able to move up to management pretty quick; meaning hard work get noticed. the hardest part of my job were the customers wanting things for free or less then nothing. Also the toy department. I think more time could have been put into cleaning it and arranging it more. overall the place was fun and felt like family.
good,They were okay to work for not all employees pull their weight. Some managers do more than required but some don't do enough. I feel if everyone did their jobs it would be better.
good,"Everyone works hard, they are willing to help you when you need it. Received assistance on getting to and from work without having to ask most times. Co-workers challenge you to do better."
good,A typical day at work included stocking and cashiering. I learned to provide quality customer service and maintain conduct and manage multiple things at once. The hardest part of the job was my manager whom was less than ideal but subsequently the best part of my job was my co-workers.
good,"I absolutely loved this job. I liked the work, Stocking was my favorite. I loved my co-workers and my customers as well. Everyday was a learning experience. Always something new, I never knew what to expect. The hardest part of the job would be when I was there alone and had to do both the work of a casher plus management. On busy days it was tough but I pulled through. I loved interacting with the customers, making them smile and have a good experience made my day better."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Dollar General of Andrews because it was a small town and it was easy to get to know the regular customers. The managers were also easy to get along with as long as you worked hard and did what they asked. The managers that I worked under were understanding that school came first, and they were always willing to work with me so I can get plenty of hours but also that I could get my schoolwork completed as well."
good,My supervisor saw potential for growth and offered me the opportunity to do so. I like the staff and the store in itself. It did not offer enough hours.
good,Shifts are usually about seven hrs. a day and the manager set a good example of how he wanted his employees to work. My coworkers were all very friendly and helpful. The best and worst part about this job can be the customers.
good,"pleasant place to work and great opportunity to advance your education. With hard work and commitment, the potential to make money is in sight. And the benefits are also great."
good,"I enjoy the work, most days it's just doing a few rolltainers and helping people out. Working I learned on how to run a cash register, and how close down the store. there is only two people working a shift so the day can get quite busy. the only hardest part of the day to me is when there is a long line and I want not keeping them waiting. the Part that I enjoy the most is when the store is empty to where more merchandise can be put up. I enjoy the Management, they tell me what needs to be done. New people will always walk the store. I get to know more about people. Seeing people faces when they compliment the cashiers or on the store itself."
good,"I really enjoy working at dollar general, it has a very cool atmosphere. The people are really fun to hang around and i look forward to going to work everyday"
good,"The job consisted of stocking the store, working the cash register, unloading truck once a week, and maintaining the upkeep and outlook of the store I worked in. A typical day was usually between a 5 and 8 hour shift. I learned how to properly work a cash register and how to create and maintain customer satisfaction. My manager and co-workers were all upstanding professionals and, to this day, are all close friends of mine. "
good,Great location < the area is next to the town pool. The park in behind the building. The best part is the baseball field next to the building. A lot of great things happening around that place.
good,"Most positions are part time, but you can get up to 36 hiurs. Fair pay. Lots of recognition for your work. "
good,"The co-workers at the store I worked at became very much like family, it was a fun, if work intense, atmosphere.  Many of my co-workers were willing to trade shifts if I needed the day off for personal reasons."
good,I enjoyed working at the Dollar General warehouse. I worked as a temporary employee. If given the opportunity I would work here if I was available. Great working environment.
good,it was a very nice and easy job and I stayed on top of my cleaning and kept all my customers happy and satisfied. I learned a lot of things from working in the enviroment
good,"A typical day at work...hmmm, Busy but enjoyable. I love all of my customers. We know each other like family. My coworkers are my extended family. The stocking is tiring when I run and lift nonstop but working out at the gym helps the physical part of the job. Being in management has helped me learn to use my brain. Paper work, counting money, using the computer more. Working with the public and helping people makes me smile."
good,Dollar General is a great place for people to start in retail especially with most of their stores being small and easy to remember product locations.
good,"Dollar General is a great beginning to a person's potential career in retail, whether it be with the company or beyond at other places due to their ability to effectively and thoroughly train each new hire in both cash register, cash handling, and customer relations. Depending on the day, the Sales Associate and Key Holder are required to complete certain tasks unique to that day so that the work follow from day-to-day can remain on schedule. Whether it be Zoning the store (cleaning, straightening merchandise), or Stocking shelves, there is always something to be tended to."
good,It was a typical part time job. The first management was horrible but this new manager is great. I've learned a lot mostly with how a team should actually work.The most enjoyable part about my job at DG was making friends for life.
good,very enjoyable job.everyone worked together to assure all projects were done in a timely manner. Everyone that worked there was always ready to give help if necessary. it was just well organized and run with guidelines to follow.
good,It was a great experience all around.  I moved up very easily and was asked to take a management position which I declined due to an offer from Frito Lay.  I enjoyed the people and the work always kept me busy.
good,A typical day in any retail environment. The management here was amazing. They gave coaching where it was needed. The hardest part of the job was not to go off on the lazy people.The most enjoyable part of the job was being asked to work extra hours when needed.
good,i was still a buyer to customers to find the cheapest cost possible
good,"Retailer of consumable goods including home cleaning supplies and chemicals, HBA , foods/ snacks, pet food/ supplies, housewares etc.."
good,when working with customers always have a good attitude. Show respect to customers. If you have a rude customer just greet them like you would do with any other and continue smiling. respect all customers. talk to supervisor about anything.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of running the cash register while getting ready for the store to close. I always worked evening shift. All of my coworkers were great people, and we always had a great time.. Making it easier to get the job done."
good,As a cashier i had fun with the customers and the staff. As a manager i learned to balance the everyday aspect of running a store and still able to enjoy the customers. The hardest part  of the job were trying to keep the shoplifters out.
good,Again meeting new people and learning new skills.The hardest part was not having reliable people show up for there shift. 
good,Opened and closed store as a lead store clerk.  Pay was competitive with available overtime.  Bonus's were frequent and of course were based on the sales and shrinkage each year so each employee was responsible for their own varying amount.  hardest part would be dealing with irate customers and rude people from time to time.  Most enjoyable was scheduling flexibility and the latest closing were 9pm so always home before 10pm.  And regular paid vacations and time and half on holidays which is hard to find these days.  And they had health insurance if you were part time or full time.
good,"Work on a normal day is very fast paced. Having to set end-caps according to Dollar General's standards, checking out customers, assisting customers with anything that they may need help with, answering telephone calls, and having to check in vendors with our products. I have learned to be a lot more patient, and learned how to manage my time more wisely in order to get all things asked of me done for the day. I have been through some co-workers, but they have all been wonderful. All have been and still are a great asset to our team. My manager has been the most understanding manager I have ever worked for. He is very caring and professional when it comes to handling major things. If anyone were to do something wrong he will let you know nicely how to fix it and will not upset you in any way. The hardest part of my job is trying to get everything done for the day. At first it seems overwhelming, but since I have been employed with Dollar General for almost a year I know how to manage my time and get it all done. With that being said there are a lot of great things about my work day, such as getting to meet such nice customers. We are in a small town and have a lot of returning customers who always bring a smile to my face when they come in and have a new story to tell me. I look forward to seeing my returning customers as well as new customers who eventually keep coming back.  "
good,Fast paced company
good,Its a really nice job. I have worked here for almost one and a half years and it requires alot of physical lifting.
good,Dollar General was a great place to work. The job itself was very easy and the staff worked well together ensuring we had a safe clean store.
good,At Dollar General you learn Alot about customers services and how to deal with different types of people .
good,"Great people to work with and great management. Easy place to fit in. The work environment can get a little hectic on certain days, but overall fine place to work."
good,Great days working with the company great customers. I've learned you can do anything if you put you mind into it. Its a great company to move up in the world.
good,The store was very friendly and professional and maintained a healthy environment for the employees. While making sure to always put the customers first.
good,I learned to multitask and deal with different situations. Customers were friendly. Management was friendly hardworking. Most enjoyable about the job was that the customers came in and made my day.
good,"Learned a lot about Retail. Also learned planograms, resets and display."
good,Normal customer experience and helping others to find what they need and when they need it. It is a fun job but sometimes I would have to work by myself and not knowing what to do at times until someone else got there to help me.
good,Its a giid place to work and learn and meet new people and advance in store or on to another store opportunitys to go to other stores and meet new people
good,daily it was great and fast-paced.  I feel that in the time of turmoil that the management team criticized more than anything. There is a such thing as constructive criticizing. Leadership is to build leaders.
good,I learned alot about sales and merchandise. stocking and customer service. management was excellent. they had flexible hours. workplace was fun and friendly. they had everything you could need.
good,the people all around are fun and its a great place to work at free lunches bar b ques the whole nine yards we are a team and there is nothing like it at all i always wanted to work for a place like this
good,I learned a lot from Dollar General they taught me how to manage a crew and run a store. I loved the work and enjoyed the customers. I really enjoy having a lot on my plate and multi tasking.
good,"Dollar General was a nice cool , relaxed job as long as you had great costumer service you would love that job . Work time was great from my schedule be cause the close at a good time."
good,"flexible hours, satisfying, rewarding, plenty of opportunities to advance, very fun and friendly work environment, competitive, can be laid back but can be fast paced"
good,loved my customers great work day come in with great work day loved coming into work with my customers daily routine money handling and working with people and unloading truck and helping customers and my employees
good,I enjoy working at any of the tasks I was assigned and made them go by quickly and in an enjoyable way. I was assigned decent hours and paid on time. I had no problems with working here.
good,Fast paced environment with great benefits as well as great pay. Always opportunities to be trained in other areas of the warehouse.
good,"It was a very good job, work was easy and,injoyable . You can work alot of hours, if your available . Management are very interested in your work and help as much as they can"
good,I enjoyed working with the company and the co-workers.Me and the co-workers and managers worked well with each other and got along with each other. I never had any problems working there and didn't have any problems with the co-workers or managers.
good,"A typical day working at Dollar General starts the minute you arrive for your shift. Constant work. Management co-workers were fun to work with, never a dull moment. The hardest part of the job was handling the store for the first couple of hours it opened by myself; checking in vendors as well as handling customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the crew."
good,"easy going, fast paced work day. co-workers were laid back and down to earth but also worked hard. weekly pay came in very useful"
good,This is an amazing place to work for they treat you with respect and very well rounded people. also clean store. and prices are great
good,"Mostly ran the register. No one really trained me. Management was all backwards. For example, too many chiefs and not enough Indians. So many people telling you what to do is confusing."
good,"I would consider a typical day at work as being safe, no accidents, and completin all assignments given during the shift. While working here I learned to operate different types of warehouse equipment. The hardest part of the job was keep production percentage at %100. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people."
good,My typical days at work are pretty much the same because I get along with just about everyone I come to get the job done and done accordingly.
good,I love working a dollar general. things can become a bit overwhelming but at the end of the day we all act like a big happy family.
good,The typical day was not exhilarating of course but there was no time for resting either. The most important lesson I learned is unfortunately customers are not your friends. There was not hard part of the job everything was fair when it came to difficulty.
good,This was an excellent job until they started cutting hours. I was promoted an promised 35+ hours a week but ended up only receiving 20 hours or less a week.
good,"Typical day is cashiering every wednesday is truck day "
good,Dollar General is a fun place to work for if you can handle a fast pace environment. You not only have to take care of customers but you also have to stock the store at the same time which I thought was fun because it made the time fly. They do not give good benefits for part-time employees but there is always room for advancement within the company. The start pay was decent in Wisconsin where I was employed and I would get anywhere between 20-32 hrs a week. I was skeptical about apply here because of the negative reviews of the company but I did and I was glad that I had a chance to work for this company and would recommend anyone that likes a fast pace work environment to apply. Be prepared to wait a little after the initial interview since they do take time processing your background check.
good,"I would make runs to the plumbing supply stores, then take the supplies to job sites. I learned some plumbing, such as hooking sinks up. I was the management, I handled all office work, phone calls, all banking (deposits and payments). I wasn't around the other employees much other than to issue their paychecks or drop supplies off to them at job sites. The hardest part of my job, was loading up two small children to make the runs to supply house. Most enjoyable part was that I was able to take my children with me so I didn't miss out on their early youth."
good,"I found the ability to move up to are exponentially wide open. They also offer great training after you've been in the job for a month so that your able to go into their corporate training class with experienced questions so that you can learn how to do your job efficiently."
good,I enjoyed with my co-workers and management team. I learned if you show initiative and follow company policy you can receive a promotion.
good,"A typical day at work made me in such a better mood because I love all my co-workers, we all knew how to work as a team to get the job done and to have the store as neat and clean as possible. The manager always stayed on top of things and if she needed anything such come to worker for someone I was there. My manger could even count on me on my off days. Doing this job taught me how to communicate properly and how to smile more. I also learned that the customer matter the most. My hardest day at work was when a customer would be in such a bad mood as give attitude toward me for no reason but I know it was my job to satisfy that customer. Most of all I enjoyed my job because it was something I loved to do."
good,"I loved going to work everyday. I enoyed working with the public, placing new product on the shelves, and helping the cashiers. Working with the public could be quite difficult at times, but still mostly enloyable."
good,"On a typical day at Dollar General, I usually will go from ringing up customers to helping out with customer service. I've learned everything from returns and exchanges, to running my reports at the end of the evening. I have also been trained for a management position and have acted as the manager on duty on numerous occasions. I was a temporary key holder while there because I was in school full time. My manager was a very understanding person whom helped guide me along the way and taught me everything she knew about management. My co-workers ware always friendly and easy to get along with and were always there if I had a question. The hardest part would have to be dealing with the constant theft in the store. We constantly had to keep an eye out for shop lifters and if we saw anyone try and shoplift then we had to stop them. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet and greet all of the customers. I loved being able to help them find things within the store and taking care of them. I was always able to help them find what they need and I was really good at taking care of the children that would come in there."
good,"Working at the Dollar General call center is very fast paced. The phones are constantly ringing with customers calling in to make complaints, or give compliments."
good,We would take down shelves and build more. We would also check on shippig and how much products we had left and needed.
good,All the way from my interview down to my last day I felt like I was happy to go to work. They know that positive reinforcement goes a long way. They are a very company to work for.
good,I love and miss my position there as an dollar General employee because every time I would come into work it never felt like work thanks to my Friendly employee's and my great and hard working manager.
good,Most of the time when I went to work I had a good day and my life and work life was balanced I still where able to live life and take care of my daughter
good,"Some days are slow some aren’t."
good,My experience working at dollar general was simple and easy and it’s a good place to work and it had great working arrangements ... customers were always satisfied
good,job was fair not much training busy alits of customers bank deposit unloading truck open and close store customer assistance stock shelves count registers and do daily paperwork
good,Good work ethics that I was willing to push every way to the fullest to accomplish any company goal that was given to me. I’m a leader who has to lead our association to the correct way to work with no mistakes
good,I learned alot of thing that i didn't know like under loading tuckes making money drops at the banks.helping people that i was over and showing them how they can grow in the business
good,"It was a cool place to work , the managers were nice . Great first job . Very easy place to work . Not hard at all & it pays well for full time workers ."
good,Store is quite busy. You get your regular customers. Work load isn't much. Saturday's we get a truck and we have until Tuesday to have all of the totes unloaded. Management is understanding of employees changing schedules
good,Just fill out the application and got hired their Works a month to 4 months and I had to leave State of Ohio have family issues said I was rehireable that's all
good,Working at Dollar general was great. They were very flexible with your schedule. The customer service was great and managers were always helpful. The work load is very easily trainable
good,Overall a fun uplifting environment.    Manager was always fair.  No discrimination in this company equal opportunity.   Would definitely work here again
good,"Fast pace work place cashiering and stocking alternately as customer flow allowed.Truly grateful for my experience here! Very good place to work with a good environment. Not too great on management, but no store is perfect, of course."
good,Its a great place 2 work i love working here it has put me in a great position to climb up the ladder with the company to advance my career it also has great benefits
good,I ran the store did displays did resets scheduling.  Did inventory. Threw the truck. Did the hiring. Worked when employees didn't show up. Really enjoyed working with my coworkers. And the company
good,"flexible, greeting customers, stocking, cashier, handling money, easy, only pays $8 and some change for regular associate...overall nice flexible job..."
good,"Customers can be rude, management is strict but is a very fun place to work especially when you have awesome coworkers. store is very busy, a good job to start off with giving the employee a great experience of customer service and how to assit customers."
good,"Provide customer service while stocking shelves. Keeping the store organized by restocking areas of heavy travel. Compiling end of day deposit and end of day reports. Assuring that the weekly ad is set and resetting certain areas that company has changed. When an associate calls in, make arrangements for another sales associate to come in for that shift."
good,Good and stable company to work with. The management is very excellent. They good career opportunities if you stick with it.
good,"Great place to work fun, safe and honest. Good opportunities for advancement.  Good employee management engagement. Leader follow rules as well as hourly employees."
good,This job was very hands on. The store manager and assistant manager was very helpful when u didn't understand a problem. The coworkers were very welcoming and friendly and also helpful. there's room for advancement
good,"My typical work day would be running the cashier and making sure the store stayed clean at all times. The job is really easy, and you get to meet a lot of nice customers."
good,I loved working for Dollar Generl was a grate place to work got along with all my co-workers and mangaement staff . The Manger of the store I worked was a good teacher and helped me a grate deal to move up in the company .If I had the chance I would go back to work at this store location .
good,"at work I stock and recover, I learn you will move up fast in the computey  management was ok , co-workers was ok the did what I ask them to do .  get off at 11 and then comeing back in at 5am to stock"
good,I like Dollar General because they were very organized and had the ability to hire good and dependable people to their staff. They also had a lot of teamwork as well..
good,there was never a slow day at work. I learned how to load trucks properly. Management was supportive and informative. Some Co-workers were welcoming and helpful. Nothing was overly difficult about the job. Enjoyable part was the long hours and great pay.
good,A typical  day at work... Dollar General is a very great company but you  have to be able and willing to provide the best store clerk service there is...
good,"great learning experience coworkers were cooperative,great teamwork"
good,"It was a greta job where everyone got along and jump in to do a great job,i just had to go do to my husband getting sick with cancer"
good,"Great prices and clean environment, friendly place to go, workers will help anyone who is looking for a certain thing in t he store."
good,A good job to gain experience. I learned how to manage money and deal with customers on the daily. I liked the management and enjoyed communicating with customers.
good,"All they did was talk at the dollar general I worked at, I was on task to get it done but they mainly hired teenagers to boss them around when they felt like it."
good,All I wanted was daytime hours. The lady mgr understood. But she walked out. Then he came. District mgr didn't put me on the schedule at all that week. I know he saw my name on the schedule last week. 1 month. Dec to Jan. How long I was there. Now I can't get a job at the store by my house because I have been deemed unrehirable.... And I just wanted daytime hours....
good,The job was ok to start over with. Eventually it became unprofessional and not enough benefits. Less hours! The manager never had an accurate schedule.
good,I had duties as a cashier that had nothing to do with my job. Such as cleaning bathrooms when we had a janitor to do that as well as take out the trash. I was also 4 months pregnant while i worked there and was told by my doctor that i was not to lift over 20 lbs and Dollar General made me lift anywhere from 35-40 lbs at a time.
good,"Great learning oppurtunity...poor managment...also poor pay..recieved full time MOD status, have to do my managers work, only making 7.75$ and hour. she is rude and racist...and very very lazy"
good,This job was very inconvenient for my life style in regards to school and work. the manager did not care about your personal life you either come to work or you don't. It was a get by job
good,"Good cashier job. Pays weekly. Friendly coworkers. Plenty of hours. Management was nice. Comfortable atmosphere. "
good,it's a normal day at work. I learn to always follow procedure always it is important. the hardest part of the job was to keep stock of everything and to make sure nothing was short or out of place to add up.
good,"i was satisfied with the job that i had to do, it was a very easy job and did not take me long to pick up and be trained. however, the hours i recieved were not that of which i applied for. i had to drive between two stores, one being on one side of town and one being on the complete opposite. i was hired on for fulltime, and was only given one day at one store, and one day at the other store. as far as the people i worked for and the training process, i throughly enjoyed it, and looked forward to the days when i would work. the companies computer system, or checkout system was fairly easy to learn, and i feel that i was an outstanding employee for this job."
good,This Job Was OK it was a need for a job at the time why i stay so long management was horrible and hours were horrible
good,I mostly worked by myself during the week but on the weekend other workers would come in. The job was not that hard just during with one co-worker. The job was very enjoyable.
good,I worked after school it was always busy management was good always working hard when we would get busy keeping the store cleaned and stocked was the hardest thing to do being with the employees friends were great the customer's were awesome
good,"I was responsible for restocking items, and cashiering. "
good,learned working with the public is a good way to communicate
good,I needed to takeoff a day for being sick and my daughter being in the hospital and my manager pretty much told me to go get screwed and not get my daughter is more important than my job then I could go ahead and quit so I did
good,Being optimistic is one of the characteristics you will need if you plan on working at dollar general. And in my experience a second job as well. The pay is weekly and you barely get any hours.
good,"Dollar general needs too much of my time i have no work / home balance ! I work every weekend faithfully &"
good,"RAther not say,I loved working there when i firsr started In Joplin Missouri But I was transferred an I ended up in a harsh work eviorment that I quit"
good,"I enjoyed working at dollar general, because of the constant interaction with people. I always enjoyed the small environment."
good,the store I worked at in edinburg tx was awesome. I learned new things that made me one of their best employee. the store in Weslaco the management needs help.
good,When i worked for them i was still in high school. So they wouldnt let me work week day only week ends. When volleyball season started I barely worked any and couldnt afford to work there anymore
good,I've learned how to deal with customers when they're angry  helping the employee to understand the customer why they angry  I learn how to be a manager count money down close the store make schedules do payroll run my own store just didn't like not being able to catch the shoplifting and getting yelled at for no reason
good,I just wish that there was advancement opportunities. The customers are ok sometimes. The dress code is really easy. The job isn't really hard it is just that you don't get enough hours and the pay rate isn't the best
good,"ive learned that the key to being a good sales associate is to make sure that you listen to all directions. the better way to be a good customer service associate is to listen more then you should talk or until information is needed to be given, being a good listener goes a long way. the most enjoyable part of my jobs is to be able to interact with other people and to make sure that they leave happy with their purchases and knowing that they will want to return again."
good,Dollar General is a great way to learn more job skills. I learned stocking and the value of hard work from Dollar General. The lessons I learned at Dollar General I can carry it with me for the rest of my life.
good,"Easy   job   but   should   pay   way   more   for   what   you   do . A lot of problems with the old technology ,  they have very  flexible   hours ."
good,It was a really great place to work at just had to many people with their hands in the cookie jar. People where calling out to much and I didn’t get many hours.
good,"Love working here would continue here but the manger makes the job difficult, and a key holder is difficult to tolerate. She refused to work evenings so she complains about everything. I'm the ASM and she puts down everything I do . I work hard and love my job, but they make it miserable."
good,It was an okay job management was horrible she didn’t care what went on in the store hired too many people so we wasn’t getting any hours the store was a disaster it wasn’t organized at all unless I worked that day and stocked everything neatly
good,Been here off and on since 2005 and was told at 12.55 an hr that my pay was at it's cap...and if specific higher ups don't like you they find reasons to get rid of you...or do things to make you quit
good,"went from a hefty 32-(+) hrs to, ""We'll call you when needed."" which was always another location & I don't own, or have a vehicle & didn't agree upon employment to those conditions."
good,Loved working with some of the employees.but if you don't suck up you don't get anywhere. You can do your job and still people say you don't. You can come in on your days off cuase people don't come in and still don't get a thanks
good,"I don’t believe that Dollar General is a bad company and for the most part I am accepting of company policy and understand the need to do things a certain way. It wasn’t the company I had an issue with it was my manager, who in all is a pretty cool guy but doesn’t take his job seriously at all and refuses to listen to employees."
good,"Really kept busy, always something to do, with customers and stocking inventory. Would enjoy working there again with the right team..................."
good,"wasn't the best place to work, management issues and no respect for there employees. This is a company that really needs so work on how to train there Manager's with better people skills."
good,management is poor other workers attitudes are poor rush rush rush no breaks and when u get a break the boss gets angry with u if your a stocker b prepaired to sit on the regester all day while the boss disapeares calling corparete the will never call u back so dont exepect help if u have a problam with a manager
good,"Id never advise anyone to work there. Poor upper mgmt., relocation at any given time, 7 day work week, no balance in family and work, not worth your health"
good,"Job was cool I really enjoyed my job, was time for my raise, so ask my Manger and she said, you have to, because she just came to this store, so I did ask , that was my job"
good,"talking to customers"
good,"Working here was my first cashiering experienceI learned alot my only problem was the management was horrible, he was not a good boss, he was horrible"
good,a typical day at work with dollar general was like not even being at work. when you think of work you think of a productive steady forward moving establishment.
good,the job was great but the manager was not he is still not he is rude to his employers as well as his customers.the store would be great with another manager.
good,"A typical day depends on the night before. Checking the status of the registers, safe fund, and running to the bank. Handling various vendors who bring product to be sold in the store daily. Management currently very new, needs more training. Hardest part of the job is I feel more like a babysitter then a part of a team. Wishing that the district managers cared more."
good,The broke alot of their own rules and when you reported misconduct to managers they would not do anything to fix it. They where just really unenforced.
good,"a good day at work is when I worked with 3 of my employees we know how to work with each other and got are work done. the only problem was when the manager was trying to hard to be apart of are crew. The manager was good with paperwork but was not a very good worker when it came to truck or stocking, she want to talk more then do the job"
good,"Enjoyed meeting new customers daily, and some of the repeating customers."
good,great experience. my first job in management position and it was awesome to be able to stand by my team and assist them with completing our work load.
good,"typical day at work came in and clocked in went and counted my money and checked people out."
good,I would go in and they would not have the truck done and wanted me to do all of it and do my facing and sweep the whole store and count the reg and do the safe
good,Unloading truck by hand
good,Was a good job till couldn't ever move up like management cause I have kids and the hours didn't work for me for the management position so I had to leave what's the point to stay if will never get raise or move up
good,The job is what you make of it. Don't let people bring you out of character. There are people ( managers) who will feel like because they have this position they can disrespect you. Stand your ground and use protocol ( chain of command).
good,"A typical day at work was clocking in, count my register. I actually learned how to use a professional register and how to manage money in my drawer and the most enjoyable part of my job was being friendly and helping customers when they came into the store."
good,They are good store to shop at but when it comes to work there its bad the pay was suck but doing the job was fun. There was nice people  working there
good,Nice place to work if you don't need but 10 hours a week. No moving up here the pay sucks and so do the hours unless your a key holder or management there is no moving up at all
good,"I was in charge of the cashier's and maintaining the store stocked as well as cleaned. Very stressful environment, but fun. I learned how to open and close a store, and the cash register's."
good,Management is hit or miss. Some are great and some are very inexperienced. The company as a whole has great values and great motto that focuses on serving others through customer service.
good,"I'm not Employed yet at Dollar General but I know on the Harvard & Tecumseh location that I shop at need night Stockers as wel and would like to fulfill the position as well because it's close to Home and just a few blocks away as well,Hire me and see what Happens when I fulfill your Shelves neatly and updated products to be sold at this fine location as well."
good,"Stocking in the morning, register in the afternoon, unless someone was already running the register, good people to work around, positive and constructive criticism well taken, instead of getting angry, they would try to show you what you've done wrong in a positive uplifting manner."
good,i am just a part time key holder we work out butts off working mainley nights ! we have no family time .we have to schedule time off and lose money.my boss is a great mgr
good,when i worked here i got to meet all the great people of rogers all over again and they were soo nice and my co workers were fantastic and super nice to me.
good,"I loved the Company, loved the customers. Have worked on and off for them for 7 years, been a store associate up to an Assistant Manager. This most recent time however, the Manager wasn't so good and left a lot to be desired. The lack of knowledge for a store manager is unreal to me. I knew stuff he didn't, he had to come to me to learn things. He needed more training."
good,"Very fast paced environment, must have the ability to multi task. The hardest part of the job is the constant changing of the products. The customers are a variety of all walks of life."
good,They give you the least amount of hours . I learned how to deal with rude and disrespectful customers without losing my cool . I learned about stuff that is in stores that I never knew were there
good,"the manager never gives me hours and call me when she wants but i need money for my family i have a step son ,my boyfriend, and my mom but she doesnt want to help me and me sitting home all day doesnt do anything for me i need a job asap"
good,"A typical day at work requires you to greet customers, operate the cash register, and stock and restock shelves. What I didn't like is when we would get busy it was hard to do all that and manage the store."
good,Understaffed and with very low budget it is hard to accomplish what upper management want accomplished. Expect little social life as most stores require you to work 6 days a week.
good,"Love shopping at Dollar General Stores, would of love working there if different circumstances. The Dollar General Store I worked at for a month, nobody wanted to work as a team."
good,Working here you have to be quick on your feet customers love shopping here long lines difficult but it's always good to leave your customers with a smile on their face great staff good benefits
good,Working at Dollar general was fun being a cashier ment u did alittle bit of everything not just ringing out customers we also stocked organized and cleaned
good,"if your looking for customer service experience ,apply here. I enjoyed my time here. Management can be somewhat irresponsible placing front line workers in bad situations. No job security."
good,The company was too demanding with productions. Also the only way to perform most job duties is to ride the equipment.
good,"My co-workers are wonderful my manager is easy to get along with. A typical day at work would be going in clock in and either start running truck or start recover the store, cleaning bathrooms and counting cigs at the end of the night along with getting the money ready. The hardest part of my job would be trying to get everything down before the night ended. The most enjoyable part would be how me and my co-workers get along so well and work together great."
good,You clock in then go count you money in the Cash register make sure that it is right then you clean or stock the shevles or you helping out customers in between time you ringing sales.At the en ight you cleaning up and counting money. Enjoyed my co-workers and the managers that I had. There isn't anything hard about the job.
good,The job was really easy. The people I worked with were great. The pay just was not worth it.
good,"The experience at Dollar General was great to become a manager "
good,The company only hires a few full-time employees.  So i only worked 8 hours a week as a part-time employee.  In order to get full -time hours I needed to go and work at other stores.
good,"Dollar General is a great company to work for, but in my opinion I feel as if the district managers need to be there for the managers more than what they are. I know that they have a lot of work to do themselves. But not enough compassion in what they do. Not enough team encouragement. Not enough feed back from them. And not a lot of help when it comes to being under staffed."
good,My review was excellent because I had a great manager who respected me and I was willing to work. I was trained in one day . The co-workers were nice.
good,The environment working here was extremely fast paced but at this particular location the employees care more about drama and rumors than actually working
good,It's a good company I just felt like the pay wasn't worth the stress. I got moved into a management position within a week of working there. And then ended up training the person that was supposed to be above me. Which wasn't fair at all.
good,"I loved the quick paced business. I loved my customers. I loved being part of such a hard working team. "
good,Dollar general is a nice place to work with many hours to give and lots of options for advancement. They also do a training period in which allows for the worker to better understand there responsibilities
good,"This is a work place that is very  challenging on a daily bases , competitive environment and fun to work for . the most enjoyable part is the customer satisfaction."
good,"how to be a stocker and move at a fast pace, always on the move and it has to less of hours, they were constantly cutting hours, and the manager didn't like the pace I had to keep myself from getting hurt"
good,"Nice company to work for ,nice people ,nice managers"
good,I don't like the way my boss give new employees more hours then me also I was given a position that she never gave me. I've been there longer then the assistant manger who don't have no experience. I feel unappreciative
good,"Dollar general is a great business, if you find a store manager that is about the store and not about they feelings. I love working there, my customer service was one of the best. The customers loved me and I loved them"
good,Not enough hours and management was terrible. I liked working for the company just had a bad store manager who would stay on phone instead of doing his job.
good,Follar general is a good starter job to have it helps u learn the techniques and skills needed to work in many functional jobs but is not something i wanted long term id advise this job to anyone just starting out
good,"A typical day at Dollar General is busy, there are vendors at least three days a week with shipments that you as a manager must verify then there is always a re-set or a new endcap that needs to be done. I loved working with my customers, most were friendly and understanding."
good,The job itself is very nice and fulfilling but the manager abuses his power and does not great people equally. Hours are given and taken away at his whim.
good,Dollar General is a fast paced environment. You have to be quick and vigilant. You have to be willing to lift a certain amount of weight and be able to stock shelves properly.
good,They exspect for you to work a lot and not get paid enough just work like crazy with no thank you or anything as I should say no appreciation and work like a dog
good,Just needs better management was a good place to work manger an people who are there before you just try and make it hard because your new.Need to be more patient with employees when your in training. Need better pay any management opportunity for you to advance and get raises
good,It wasn't a horrible place to work. The customers were great. I had a decent time there. I worked while I went to college and took care of my husband who broke his back at the time.
good,I took pride in trying to have happy customers at all times.  I never saw an undesirable customer coming into the store.  The store I worked in was in a small town and everybody knew everybody's name. I enjoyed the customers that came in and also enjoyed the people I worked with.  I guess I have a little OCD and it was fun trying to keep the store straight (i couldn't help myself to stop and straighten) and it was a challenge to receive a truckload of products and then slowly getting the back room emptied.  Making sure if there was an empty spot on the shelf and checking to see if more in back room so as not to be an empty spot.  Doing planograms was a fun challenge because we had old shelving and had to make it work and look good but maybe not quite like the picture but the customers never new any better they would just notice new product or set up.  I enjoyed this job.  The only complaint would be upper management.  very cut throat and two faced. I wouldn't or could't work with folks of that nature again.  I believe in being honest and if it needs to be said out loud then say it outloud because communication is key to everything. Without communication nothing ever comes together and it definitely makes teamwork hard on a team.
good,the other emploees are great the manager was rude. all in all it is a good work place. the customers was very nice an understanding. but they put way to much on one person running the register.
good,Great job ... I loved the atmosphere and the employees ... I loved the team work we had and the constant work load ... Wonderful time ... Great experience in all aspects of working at a store ...
good,it was alright I suppose they will write u up for any little thing the managers at my location were clicked up and the best of friends so there was no opportunity for advancement and they would write me up over the littlest thing like forgetting to clock out.
good,"Did have any hard part on the job,but some co-workers didn't like to work in teams. Only one manger was power crazy. Most of the time I work using cash register and stocking item on shelves."
good,"As a lead sales associate, I've dealt with customers, and their needs."
good,"I enjoyed working at my store, my store was in a bad neighborhood so often times things were left destroyed and my coworkers often didn't work as hard as I did, and basically did what they had to do just to get by and not get fired. not a good place to work. only a stepping stone for me."
good,"Family orientated working enviroment, loved the managers and the customers that came in the store, the products were all high quality products, at a good price."
good,"Hired and trained over 60 personnel to become proficient in the retail industry.  Performed opening and closing operations at the store with no supervision.  Accounted for over $3,000 daily while running various shifts."
good,"although there is a promise of work life balance, I did not find that here. the hours are long and no help to support business needs. although my talents utilized kept operations afloat, the hours were brutal..."
good,"could not understand concept of reaching truck, was thrown into work and closed on my own two days after being hired in, worked there for two months and never received full training....i was a manager."
good,"While I've only worked at this job for 2 months, I do like the place. It's a different experience under my belt. I do appreciate the care my General Manager puts into the company and employees. She is a Strict but, nice boss.  "
good,"I check out customers throughout the day put stuff up as customers do not want at the cash register. Help with whatever the manager needs done such as organizing shelves, cleaning bathrooms, and assisting customers. I honestly do not think there is a hard part to my job. If I could work there while pregnant and perform all of my responsibilities, then it is pretty easy. The most enjoyable part of my job in dealing with the public such as customers I know most of them by first name and provide them with a friendly environment while they are at dollar general."
good,"I would start my day off by putting away stock that needed to be put back from the night before , runing the cash register"
good,"I open the store by disarming the security alarm. Booting up, put starting cash in draw. work over stock, P.O.G plan-o-grams. count OUTS. Count Ciggaretts. Recover when needed. check emails for DM advice and discontinued items, mark downs ect... i run register till my cashier get to work at 12 pm, then i spend the next 4 hours completing tasks and listing the night shift tasks to complete."
good,a typical day at work is fast paced and you learn something new from co workers and customers each and every day management is great co workers are for the most part friendly the hardest part of the job is truck day but nothing I cant handle the best part of my job was interacting with customers every day
good,learned cash register/ loss prevention / most enjoyable working with people
good,A typical day at work for me would be me taking care of customers needs and stocking at the same time. I have learned how to better myself as and individual at the company. The managers there a really great I love my managers. The co-workers have their days some have attitudes and some I can make smile. The harderst part of this job would be for me to try and stop a person from stealing the merchandise. The most enjoyable part of this job is me coming to work knowing my customers will make my day.
good,I got fired by my store manager because of a family emergency and called her boss on her and he hired me back and she told me I couldn’t come back to work unless I had a dr excuse for missing two weeks before.
good,"Working at dollar general was a good experience for me I learned how to communicate with strangers and learned more about respect once I met my coworkers. Everybody there was cool, did there job so it wasn’t necessarily a problem for the next worker."
good,"work place was alright if you know how to manage being a cashier, customer service, and be a janitor all at the same time aside from that management could use some improvements and the organzizations of the store.Dont get me wrong about the employee every sigle one of them do what they are expected by the end of the day i can definetly feel the comoderey in this environment"
good,Blah blah yadda yadda I miss working there it was great boss wasn’t worth the time but over all that was the happiest I’ve ever been at a job if I could I would do it all again
good,Great place to work if store is managed properly. If store is not caught up in getting inventory to the shelves it makes it hard .  Love to put ideas of improving the stores in action. Clean store and merchandise on shelves equal happy customers.
good,Iliked my manager alot and my co workers the job was very flexible with the hours and flexible with the shifts also I enjoyed the customers I enjoyed it alot
good,No comment ... i would still be working for dollar geneal if it wasn't for bad management . I love the store itself and the customers.  My opinion about what was going on wasn't acknowledged i was just thrown to the curb.
good,Management team became incompetent and unable to remain collaborative in maintaining appropriate daily operations of the store and staff. Customer satisfaction could no longer be meet.
good,"I was a full time employee. Basically I did the work of a manager but got paid as at normal pay.  I learned how to close and open the store. I took a leadership role which I wasn't used to. But I did well at it. I think the hardest part of my job was rude customers and haveing to maintain a positive attitude and be act of of character. However when I admitted myself into the hospital for personal reasons and was told that I abandoned my job. I had doctors notes and I wasn't even on the schedule to work that week, ( schedule wasn't made out yet) So they fired me. What was most aggravating was I was just eligible for employee benefits."
good,Could be very annoying at times. Especially when you're trying to stock and constantly have to stop to assist other cashier. Working there was fine until it wasn't. Management did not stick up for me after asking me to come in earlier than scheduled and to bring my child with me. I was on the chopping block by myself.
good,At first I got told I was awesome I was great then when other ones came hours got cut got told lies about getting to move closer to home cause the manager was leaving the store to go to another one and taking me with her cause she know i has her back and yes I did. And still would if she didn't make me feel unwanted and used. Besides that i really liked my job and most of the other workers
good,This was my third job - ever - and the manager expected perfection when she herself could not live up to it. What I mean by this: she expected certain things to be done but then would perform the task poorly herself or would make bigger mistakes that cost the workplace money. She also chose favorites and would allow those people to basically do whatever they wanted on the job while I had to adhere to extremely rigid standards. Either have the standards for everybody or don't bother trying to call yourself a manager.
good,Dollar General is not a family friendly company to work for.    The store will always come before your sick kids.  There is a lot of favoritism with in the company.
good,It was okay to work there depending on the management and the team that I was given. The management made the team and it sucked big time. If the management was different I would go back
good,"I learned not to include anything with my work, whether friends, family or etc. The management team weren't that reliable nor much understanding, but I pretty knew where I stood from day 1 within the company!"
good,great place to work i love the environment and the people that was a great customer service job i love interacting with my customers and making them smile
good,"I learned alot working for Dollar General. More about the ins and outs of a retail store. How to receive product,stock product and merchandise product."
good,Working for dollar general has been a great experience. It is only with the inconsistancy of hours and poor store management that I have decided to move on
good,"I truly loved my job,  after 3 years,  new management  started pushing everyone out if she didn't like them or she hired a new person she seemed to like better that week I watched 32 employees leave in my 3 years most all due to her"
good,"My upper management was extremely rude and bias"
good,"It is overall a good company, just don't pay enough and don't offer a lot of hours. It is easy to move up into higher positions.  Typically stocked the store, handled customers meaning I checked them out or helped them with a return, I would count down drawers and handle the deposit. I liked the people that I worked with a lot. The hardest part about this job was one not having enough people to help lessen the load basically just two people who pushed stock out onto the floor, also another hard part was not being able to do much about the people that would take from our store."
good,I learned great management skills and while working there sharpen my skills on multi tasking. A great fun place to work. Was able to use my past experience with this job.
good,"You meet new people, and make friends with customers, but management sucks. You basically have no life outside of work."
good,One of the easiest jobs I ever had. Fun staff. Management cares about you. Not much advancement but nice job. Low pay unfortunately
good,There is so much work that you will never have any free time. You also will never finish. There is a reason that you have never been inside a Dollar General that did not have boxes all over the floor. You will never get all the boxes on the truck out before the next truck comes in.
good,"This was a very  productive place to work. I have really learned alot from this company being that this was my first job. it taught me patience, and hard work."
good,open store clean before customers enter greet and make sure lanes are clean product in right place run register learned management duty's worked as a team with co-workers the hardest thing was theft in store but i enjoyed the customers
good,"Day opening or closing store, run register, received stock, put up stock, daily paperwork bank deposits, counted all monies from day to day"
good,"I would receive in new grocery trucks, and stock groceries. I would also work at cash registers when needed. I later became lead stocker. I've learned that speed is an advantage! Management was good at helping when needed. The harderst part of that job was working a manager that has a lack of concern for employer, employees, and customers. The most enjoyable part was training new employees."
good,A typical day at dollar general would intail running the store properly
good,Meeting new people and coworkers make it fun to come to work.
good,"my work day started going to the bank to make deposit"
good,I’m fresh out of high school with little skills at this time. I’m looking for a company/ someone who is willing to teach me a skill as I am excited and willing to work and learn
good,Enjoy my job  Love working with the public  Very clean store  Manager is flexible on our schedule  Only pay rate is not good  Dollar General Market is one of the best
good,I enjoy working with customers  and working with others I was a stocker and sales person at dollar general  I was a assistant  manager  and I just love to work I am hyper to most customers  likes how I treat them
good,I totally love my job at Dollar general because I love working with people . I do feel Alot of times very understaffed so I'm not able to complete all my tasks because I'm having to cashier I believe in the dollar general mission but very understaffed
good,was very fun and easy to pick up on with friendly coworkers and thirty min break. Learned customer service skills and register operation. Hardest part was keeping the place neat and clean. Felt like a family away from family.
good,"You were expected to show up for your shift, and work if someone called you were asked to work a second shift. You had the right to say no though. "
good,"I was the assistant manager for 2 years. It was a wonderful place to work. The manager helped a lot. He was a friend. All the people I worked with were great, we were like a family."
good,"I worked there in 2008 and loved it. always busy, good co workers, respectful customers. Pleasant clean place. Minimum wage for that time.  There were not many  summer hrs. I was part time so I did not have benefits."
good,dollar general is a very busy company you will always on your feet people coming and going out of the store. The hardest thing there is you have to stop what your doing if your the cashier or when the lines get full you have to make sure your on a fast pace
good,"I loved working at dollar general. I enjoy helping customers, store maintenance, stocking product on a weekly basis. Retail store, working with coworkers to making customers feel welcome and understanding coupons, digital coupons, dollar store discounts."
good,"Deals with many customers a day, you have to work the register and do whatever has to be done that day (totes, recover, overstock, sky shelves). If you know your way around the store, working there is a breeze. "
good,I helped customers find their items. I have learned to deal with different attitudes with grace. Th most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know the regulars.
good,I would have stayed if there were more hours. 5 hours a week isnt enough for anyone to even make a career advancement if they wanted. With these hours no wonder there is employee turn over.
good,It was a great experience.  One that i wouldnt mind trying again. The people i worked with were very helpful and energetic. The customers were the main focus once we stepped foot into the store.
good,You have to stock and greet customers and put away stuff that people decide to return known as go-backs and clean store at end of the day. I loved it.
good,It really hard to work there and ive been doing it for 10 years they dont care about their employees  i just really needed a job and hate looking for one but i cant take the stress of this job anymore they pick and choose which policies they want to abide by and they put to much work on their employees
good,Dollar General is a good company to work for if you are looking for a part time job. Getting to full time at my store is not possible due to the lack of hours allocated to our store. its hard to survive off the wages and hours they give.
good,It was fun working with everyone here that had goon skills and we kept the place looking pretty decent everything was pretty good until the last couple weeks
good,"The hours were always cut, low pay, for all hard work great management just needs some changes. I loved being apart of the team just some days I felt not as important to the team"
good,I loved working at Dollar General overall but I also couldn't deal with the pay and hours. They don't worked you enough and if you need more hours you must go to another store... Which someone who does not drive cannot do so...
good,Employees don't help the other employees working there. You are basically on your own. And it's very unorganized. It was a stressful environment but the customers were amazing.
good,It is fast paced. You have to be on your toes at all times. It can be very stressful when working with the public. You must always keep the customer happy.
good,good pay every week the only thing that i  did not like was the mangment they were completlry unfair at times and were not fair with scheduleing but pay was good
good,"By far one of the best jobs I have had. Environment was amazing, managers were great. It was steady paced and relaxed. I have an amazing time working there."
good,it was temp to hire so i really dont know the ins and outs but we worked long hours getting the store ready for opening and they did want it done within a certain amount of time
good,Been employed for 4 years depends on area and people . You can expand depending on skills. Hours vary and it a fast pace working environment.  Need lots team work.
good,"It was a great job the customers were always nice. I counted my draw before and after my shift, unload the truck when it would come in and still be at the counter to ring out people, clean up at night sweep the floors and fix the product."
good,I enjoyed the time that I worked there but my schedule wasn't the best and I couldn't spend time with my family. My hours went from mornings to all nights and every weekend and no time off to spend with my family.
good,"At Dollar General, you work extremely hard for minimum compensation. If you show a commitment and work hard for them, they will work you harder without giving a pay raise."
good,Would work for the company again.. People friendly. I enjoyed my time previously employed and was always there for my shift and was always willing to come in on my days off.
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General. Fairly easy job, great place to earn ""management skills"" due to lack of micromanagement. Hardest part about the job would be unloading the truck. Most enjoyable aspect  would be interacting with the people in your community."
good,I learned that not everyone is your friend in this job. People like to use you as their crutch no matter how long you have been there compared to them. There is not alot of team work with this company.
good,"Loved my co-workers. At the time, everyone worked together to get their jobs done. They were sweet and understanding. Not judgmental."
good,"A typical work day involved cleaning, stocking and recovering the shelves. I have learned a lot working for this company. I love to help people. I loved everyone I worked with. Management needed some work. They need to learn how to train the proper way. I would stand and watch and ask questions when I didn't know how to do something or I wanted to learn more. Most of the time no one in management wanted to take the tie to show us how to do it. The hardest part of the job was inventory. The most enjoyable part was the customers. They made the day worthwhile."
good,We stocked shelves and waited on customers. The hardest part I disliked the most was the holidays. The closer it was to a holiday the nastier people were.
good,My co-workers are wonderful as well as the management team. It is a great learning environment for me. The most enjoyable part of the job is working together as a team to get specific projects done. The hardest part of my job is letting down customers due to policies put in place by the company.
good,Typically I would cut the grass once a week.  On the occasion of a tenant moving out I would repaint the walls and clean up the inside. I have also replaced the parts of several porches with new boards.
good,"Willing to help others, pointing directions isn't recommended so I take the customers to the product, to hear a customer say thank you is the best reward to receive."
good,"a typical work day was busy."
good,"Clock in, sing-in to the register, help out customers, stock the shelves if need be, make sure the store is clean, then at then end of the day, I left."
good,"A normal day consists of placing smiles on the customer face, and following the orders handed down from my superiors. What i enjoy the most is the customer, and assuring they are happy during their visit."
good,"I waited on my customer's, I have come to love my co-workers and some of my customer's. I learned if you want something out of life you got to take it. You can not sit and wait on the manager to do it for you! To me there was not a hard part, just some frustrating time's! My whole day would be enjoyable, I liked my co-worker's and my manager's. I think it was the best job. It just wasn't enough hours to make any money."
good,"The culture of the people you came in contact with was wonderful, like a small town feel of everybody knows everybody. However, the lack of management was stressful. You could not find a manager, and they had no way of communicating besides yelling through the entire store."
good,"Dollar General has changed lots since last working there but pay is still low, not enough of inventory, no benefits or discounts."
good,You have to restock inventory everyday while checking people out and it gets repetitive but is also a different experience with new people and new stories.
good,Hours are very inconsistent and they only offer part time. Pay is only minimum wage . Do not offer any benefits to part time workers. Only managers get full time hours
good,This job was okay. It was great at first but when i went on maternity leave i felt as those when returning my job was already given away and didnt feel a real sense of security in my job.
good,I like the job and helping customers making sure the store was in order. Keeping a smile on my face and greeting the customers. Coming to work on time to make sure I did my part as a team member.
good,Dollar general can be a great company to work for and you can also Excel really fast if you show you are determined and show that you know what your doing.
good,Working for dg is great ... U meet great cutomers and advance quick . Of course with the right manager u can go very far for Dollar general. There is alot u have to learn but it's worth it .
good,"Amazing job to have, they're very picky about the law though & will let an amazing worker go for a misunderstanding. "
good,It was a great job I loved my coworker just wanted a career. It has great hours they tried to work around kids schedules of you had them.you could move up if you worked hard. Opportunities to work at other stores to help out
good,Not enough hours and pay for the time spent there. The responsibilities of the job are not a problem. Dealing with the employers and customers are not the hard part. The worst part is over worked and under paid.
good,"I loved my job, just didn't like how my manager would change the schedule without telling anyone. It's a lot of multitasking but a great job! The hardest part of the job facing all the customers when I had to call management to void something out for me after a customer told me they didn't want the item after all."
good,"I worked closing at our local Dollar General. I would come in an hour before rush at 6, and would close up at 10. Normally the days were great, coworkers were nice to be around but did like to forget to take our phone so I would have to walk around the store to find them if I needed help up front. Management was very nice about me having to call in sometimes due to having to finish a project for school."
good,Overall Dollar General is a  relaxing environment you’re in your own space you have your own space you get to meet new customers and meet see different faces
good,Dollar General is a good place to work if you're in management and you don't want to do anything on weekends. Very hard to learn where everything goes in the store when the manager leaves you with 16 totes to put away and you have to deal with customers. Also hard to fully help customers when I can't tell them where things are because I don't know. I cant void items off the computer or basically do anything to help them because I don't have a key. Terrible when I have to hold up people in line because I'm out looking for my manager to help me when she's off hiding.
good,Hardest part is the rude customers and having to take it. Most people that worked there was really good to get along with so that made the days way better
good,My review of dollar general is that it's amazing work opportunity to better learn and hone my customer service skills and the chance to work alone and train to be a manager they train you on every aspect of running the store
good,"cleaning before store is about to close"
good,"I learned how to manage the cash register, I learned how to handle negative customers. A typical work day would be checking customers out and restocking shelves. The management was good."
good,When u worked there my manager would have me doing hers and the assistants jobs so they could so whatever they wanted I wouldn't of minded if I was being paid what they are to do so.
good,"The town I worked in was very small, and where the store was located you could not see it, and you did not know that Solomon had a dollar general unless you lived in that town. It was very slow and you usually had nothing to do but walk the isles and adjust product over and over again. Not a place for me to work, I like to be in a fast paced environment and this certainly was not."
good,I worked at dollar general for about 3 months the job wasn't hard. I had a great team at dollar general too bad it didn't last long. One thing i do have to say is that as much as we would clean the store up and make it look as clean and neat as possible it never worked.
good,"Cashier, stock,  closing store, help customers find products that they needed, and at the end of the day I will mop the floors, wipe shelves down, and restock the refrigerator,and the freezes."
good,Dollar General started off good for me because I had a lot of hours but weeks and months after starting my hours went down and I was not getting paid enough for me to live off of.
good,"I had a wonderful experience at Dollar General, I loved to come to work. It became a problem when my boss was scheduling me to close the store to much."
good,This job was my first job and it was great . I loved working here the staff was awesome and very helpful. Working here taught me a lot and the customers were very nice at times
good,"Working for the Dollar General that I worked for there was always something to do. I was either running the register, stocking shelves, facing, dealing with customers, it was a good experience learning all the different fields within the store."
good,Dollar General as a cooperation isn't a bad place. It was a fast past and multi tasking environment. And you had to be on top of your game at all time.. I learned how to stock and run a store.
good,"On a daily basis showed my positive upbeat personality while assisting customers as a cashier , sales associate , or stockperson and gladly assisting the store manager with any additional store projects or additional tasks that were challenging like putting up displays or window advertisements ."
good,"Easy job, relaxed, flexible if you have another job or are in school. good management, lack of career advancement, run register, stock foods, pretty laid back job"
good,"work at this company is quick and you have to be on your p's and q's"
good,I loved working at Dollar General. It was a nice slow paced fun place to work. Loved talking with customers and my coworkers made the day go by a lot faster.
good,"My experience with working for Dollar General was'nt all that bad, but it was'nt all that good. Some days were better than others. Most of the time you get great customers and somethimes you get the really picky ones. As long as you are people friendly this is the job for you."
good,Not really enough benefits .. Work place was okay pay was awful. I hated how much work I had to do for a small pay per hours. Basically made about 200 every week.
good,"It's a great place to work at. The managers are nice, and will be patient if you don't understand a certain subject. The hardest part of the job is not snapping on customers who won't listen to company policy."
good,very poor management and no body cares about one another.  job security is bad due to poor upper management   no one carried about each other as a district manager
good,I like but I had job at Woodridge and didn't fit my schedule so I had to leave dollar General all for me to be at work on time for my other job but if I had to go back I would
good,"The manager that I worked for made working for Dollar General fun and the day go by quickly.  The hardest past of the job would have been that I was the only person who really stocked the store, but it was great!"
good,"Great Company to grow with, social skills and popularity within company play big role in advancement. company wants full job availability and does not work well with you to balance job and life. overall great experience, good company, Highly recommended to work there!"
good,Co workers were amazing but upper management sucked. Over worked and under paid. Customers wasnt so friendly. Had to deal with attitudes from customers and employees.
good,Decent environment needs more security though and needs a better pay per hour for amount of work asked of you. I effectively was doing a assistant manager/ manager position for 7.50 which is outrageous. I worked a week straight from 7-9 because we were so short and our manager was needed elsewhere.
good,"Productive and fun work place,i learned that some people don't care if their employees are going through loss whether its death or financial. Mainly the store manager. My other co-workers were really helpful. The hardest part of my was taking a break  i really loved what i di and it was hard to stop. I had to remind myself i got to take a break. I think the most enjoyable part was seeing all the friendly faces and knowing that i helped them with part of their day ."
good,I learned a lot it was my first job how to help people  always be on your toes even working on a store you never know what will happen the customers where the best always made your day!
good,"I didn't like that they left me alone to take in a truck by myself. They left me alone pregnant and hardly a had help. was complain when I could make it cause I was sick due to being pregnant,"
good,the only problem with working for this company is that they do not work you enough hours to be able to get any health benefits. Helping people is a plus to the job.
good,"Pay is great but hard to advance.They always tell me how great an employee I am, but I feel like I'm never given the opportunity to go further. If you are looking for great pay and benefits, dollar general is definitely a great choice."
good,"Was a friendly work environment. The customers were also friendly. Other employees taught me well. I got the hang of it fairly fast. Wanted to stay busy, so when I was not busy, I was always asking what I can do unless I already knew what other things to do. Don't like standing around. Manager worked with me on my schedule, because I have children and had school."
good,"worked hard stocking shelves, carrying out the best customer service, online and phone meetings, travel. I learned to put my people skills to work while maintaining a professional work place. My co-workers were the best-they were dedicated to working for the company the same way I was. The hardest part of this job was the long hours. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers. they were fun and some made challenges of my day but in the end they were great."
good,"My typical day included training new hire employees, managing the checkout counter and balancing cash registers.  I enjoyed interacting with customers everyday.  My district manager was absolutely awesome.  Even though the pay was extremely low, she made me feel the work I performed was important.  Advancement opportunities are rare which is the main reason I left the company."
good,"I liked working at dollar general. The people were great and it was a fun environment to work in. I enjoyed talking to the customers, and getting hear how their day has been. reorganizing the shelves and stocking was always fun for me and I was good at it."
good,"Even on a slow day, there was always something to do at Dollar General. When there were no customers in the store, we as employees always had something to keep us busy - whether that be cleaning or stocking. I received my general retail knowledge from this company: cashiering, stocking, and general cleaning and maintenance. My co-workers, I didn't see much of. There were so few of us, and one of us would work the register and the front half of the store while the other stocked and worked in the back half. Management was easy to get along with and very understanding. The hardest part of the job were minimum breaks and no where to sit if needed. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet all sorts of people and make new acquaintances."
good,"respectful, friendly, and loving customers.  I loved working there to help get the customers food to them in a fast and mannerable way"
good,"not a bad company to work for the people were all great. the company has problems communicating among its various branch's though, left hand just doesn't talk to the right one."
good,I would come in count money hand out the cashier drawer look at my emails for the day and start cleaning up the store or moving things around putting up sales on sales day then i would pull things back into the store and start doing nightly duties. we would close store count money down and then go home.
good,"Coming inside the store early in the morning, to then re-stock the shelves of its merchandise. I learned how to do something you might not enjoy but still get the job done. The hardest part was being under staffed almost everyday."
good,loved helping others find what they needed to start their day or get things needed for their families
good,A typical  day at work for me would be a very busy day. What ive learned at dollar general is that its very important to interact with your customers to met there needs and keep your customers happy. Management was wonderful very understanding mangers. My co-workers were great team players. There wasn't really any hard part working at dollar general. The most enjoyable part was working with the customers and getting to know them.
good,"Open/close of store, keeping store clean, run register, unload truck, stock merchandise, watch for shoplifters, give customer service, refunds and exchanges, bank deposits, get change at bank for day, going to post office, lead cashier. I learned how to open and close store, management, how to deal with unhappy customers. I liked most of my co-workers. The hardest part is being in charge. The most enjoyable part is working with most of the customers."
good," Say Goodmorning! punch in count the cash drawer confer with manager about extra duries for the day,  Operate cash register have one on one contact with cusromers,put away stock, one manager and one employee work each day.I learn new ways to help the customers by locating the merchandise they need or make suggestions.Im always finding new stock almost every day.  The hardest part of my job is mopping the floor and closing the store ,getting it ready for the next day of bussiness.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working at the cash register and interacting with the customers and helping any way that I can"
good,counted down drow stocked the front ran cashregester went on break locked up cleaned and we all left together
good,I realy loved my job at dollar general I worked hard and did what had to be done..
good,"Forklift operators are responsible for operating and managing industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities."
good,"I loved working there. It was a really great and enjoy the people. "
good,"Great staff, lovely environment. Would love to go back if I could. But I live too far away from Elmer, NJ. Maybe I can find another store closer to where I live."
good,This is a great place to work it doesn't pay alot but it's a great environment. You can meet all kinds of people everyday and it gets you out of your comfort zone.
good,"I loved working at Dollar General. It was a very fast paced job that kept me on my toes. I loved the customers and my fellow employees, I loved being a key holder and being able to be promoted quickly."
good,"s. I am going on three years of doing customer service and with my time doing"
good,Being a key holder was the best part about working for dollar general . I enjoyed stocking shelves and end of the light paperwork. had an outstanding crew
good,Nice employees very helpful with hands on training they sure job was done correctly before leaving you alone and if you had any questions they never hesitated to provide the answers

good,It’s was a great store to work at just I had to move away Nd go some else were with better pay but the job it’s self is  a great experience of learning for a next position somewhere else
good,Im a patient person..i will take my time and answer any concerns or questions ..that a customer may have..im a pretty quick learner..if i don't understand something..i will ask questions..i won't leave until my job is done...
good,"dolla general was a good environment to work in , great coworkers,  very friendly with all customers that came in the store and tried best to thier ability to meet all needs with everyone in the store ."
good,"It is a fine environment and a upstanding place. Good customer service,fine stock,friendly employees, and a overall fine establishment to not only work at but, to also shop at."
good,the work culture was very diverse and family and customer friend. I loved going to work but had to leave due to family issue. But it great to meet new people
good,I had to keep up with money per day and give a deposit per day. Also customer service and over see two employees a day. I helped the manger per day as well.
good,Loved working here and the people I worked with were so sweet. It was an easy yet challenging at the same time work flow. Dollar general genuially cares about their customers and workers
good,Ppl were nice and everyone understanding they didn't get in the way and helped when needed no no complantes wouldn't mind working there again if need be.
good,"Overall I loved my job, I was used to a more set schedule and longer hours.The job and the people where great , I’d go back if I absolutely need to until then I’ll look further in my retail experience."

good,Pay is nowhere near what it should be for what they expect for you to accomplish. I loved working with the customers and keeping the store looking nice.
good,The store manager had great customer service although the communication through the store could use some improvements right along with the safety of the store. Other than that great store.

good,DG is a growing company that is actually a pretty big player in the discount retail field. I don’t see growth slowing at all and if you’re a valued employee it offers flexibility whether you’re relocating or climbing the pay ladder. The pay is not supportive of families with dependent children unless it is a supplemental gig. I’m close to retirement age and I’ll keep my position until standing becomes difficult.

good,"I opened the store, put out stock, arranged seasonal and various other daily tasks. It allowed me to grow into management. The hardest part of the job was ensuring we were properly staffed at all times. The turnover at all locations was a constant problem.

good,Easy enough job and I loved my bosses. However it's hard to keep employees or find good ones so we usually end up shorthanded. Great for those who can handle customers and have good time management skills.
good,Working here was okay. I enjoyed my co-workers but just did not get enough hours to provide. I managed on this pay but ended up leaving for a better paying job.
good,my health stopped me from working but I can work if I'm relaxed I did not have a good time a work at no time and I stayed sick and manager was not helpful
good,"I liked working here, it was very relaxed and fun environment. My manager was just not a very nice person. They were verbally abusive towards me, and me being a nieve 18 year old, I didnt do anything about it."
good,"When I started working at Dollar General in October 2017, the current manager barely gave me any training on the register. She left me to figure out how to operate it on my own. I had no clue what I was doing my first day. Mind you, this was my first ever job & I had ZERO experience as to working a cash register."

good,"learned a great deal, enjoyed the office work, enjoyed learning the receiving of products, vendors were self sufficient, a peppy work environment, enjoyed pushing freight"

good,This job was definitely fast paced the atmosphere was very hectic we worked till the job was done which sometimes would be the next day. If you aren't used to working long hours and standing on your feet this job isn't for you.

good,"Setting up register for sales. greeting customers and providing assistance with their purchases. completing purchases with cash, credit or debit payment methods. Liked working there. Job was part-time. I needed more hours."
good,This was excellent until a new store manager took over. She was strict on the scheduling. You had to work the days and shifts she scheduled you even though you had a set shift for old manager. I was let go because I refused to work scheduled shifts. At that time I was working another job.
good,"nice employees"
good,"At Dollar General you dont have just one role. You run register, stock, check in vendors, all in a normal days work. As a store manager you have to keep up with payroll hours and budget, store appearance and making sure your employees are doing what is expected.

She was later let go after I resigned. Overall, working here was great. I really enjoyed the rest of my team and doing my job."
good,"Dollar General in Brookfield, Ma is a great place to work. The managers are friendly and welcoming, as are the people you work with.

I made less than a dollar more an hour than the sales associates. Truck day was a nightmare, when I was a manager in the mall, I would get a 50 or 60 box truck and have 5 or 6 people to help me get it out quickly. Every truck at Dollar General was over 1,000 boxes and most often it was just me, one other person if I was really lucky, to get it out."
good,"fast pasted fun work environment, very helpful employees that are willing to show the new people the ropes& nice work atmosphere"
good,My time as a sales associate in Dollar General was great because I had hardworking coworkers. The manager and assistant managers helped me out on how to work  the cash register after I learned it was easy from there on. I would handled money and greet the customers and since I was the only one who spoke Spanish I would translate for them sometimes. The hardest part was that since I wasn't a manager or assistant manager I couldn't void off some products the customer didn't want. So each time a customer didn't want a product I had to call in one of the managers to void it off. Other than not being able to void off some merchandises I didn't find anything else hard in working there. The thing I enjoyed most in Dollar General   was the part where you interacted with the customers. You would get regulars and they would always be friendly such as saying hello and smiling.

good,"I have been with this company for 7 yrs. I loved working with the other employees, had no problems. The manager was very good at what she done. The manager needed to make better choices of the people that she would hire. The hardest part of the job was learning to stock items in the right place and learning how to read the label on the item it would tell you exactly where the product went. Anytime you work in retail expect the customers to make a mess but it does get old. Everybody worked hard to get the job done and tried to get it done on time. Not always was it done on time. I loved it when we got to know when product went on sale before anyone else."

On truck days I would have to put away totes which are the small things that go in the front of the store generally. My biggest responsibility was running the register when ever there was a customer up there. If a customer needed help I would walk them to the item. Management was good, my manager was a very nice person and I went to school with her daughter. I loved working with all my co-workers, if I needed anything I knew I could go to them. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry/rude customers, but I learned how to deal with them in a respectful manner.

good,"I had to stock shelves and work register and clean store. I learned how to multitask. My manager was the selfish type who wanted everything done to her expectations but was ugly when you asked for help. She also changed the schedule whenever she wanted so you always had to call on days off in order to make sure you did not have to work for that day. The Assistant Manager is great she will work right there with you and help without saying a word she is a very hard worker.  All of the other workers are hard workers as well. Its not a bad job, it just don't pay that much."

The atmosphere in the store was great simply because everyone was different so everyone had something to bring to the table. To me the hardest thing of the job was dealing with thieves, because most of the time we would realize something was missing after the fact and we had to go through the security tapes to see if we could locate the person but it was gratifying to find out who did it so we could take proper action. The most enjoyable part of the job was simply helping out customers finding what they needed or helping little kids pick out school supplies for a new school year."

good,"To have the knowledge and responsibilities of a Store Manager without the pay.  I loved my job because I loved my customers, however, the job entailed entirely too much responsibility to the Assistant Manager.  Very high volume in inventory/receivables, and stock.  Too many tasks for one individual, and too many requirements for the cashiers to meet and to be able to provide optimum customer support simultaneously.  Very high stress, but will definitely make you a professional in multitasking.  "

Co-workers for easy to get along with, one of my challenges working there was customers stealing from the store; however I've managed to shut down that process completely as long as I was working there I had no more experiences like that.

I wouldn't mind going back to work at dollar general. All around it was a decent place to work I just wish the hours were more but its a mandatory 20hrs a week."
good,Great company... Truly believes in promoting and developing from within.  Very fast paced environment and can often be a challenge; but if you put your mind to it; everyday is worth it.
good,The only reason I am looking for alternative work is due to the lack of further advancement. I work very hard and I want to keep moving up however at this point it feels like I am at a stand still even though I push myself above and beyond every day to the point now it feels like I’m being taken advantage of.
good,"Assist all customers' with all questions',insure order accuracy, run cash register, balance registers' at the end of each shift, complete store deposits' and change fund at the end of each shift, deliver deposits' to bank, pick up change for store from bank, count inventory, stock all different types of merchandise, organize and recover store merchandise, clear out of date merchandise, build planograms', close and open store and clean inside and outside of the store."
good,"Always on your feet working, but very fun environment. I left because the manager was not doing her job and would throw her responsibilities onto everyone else."
good,"This is a great starter job where you learn everything from people skills, cash register and stocking.  Unfortunately all the employees are hired as part time so no benefits."
good,It was a very nice experience for me to be working with customer's was able to help them out on the floor and cash them out as well the manager was awesome she worked around my schedule for me to be able to work my morning job and then dollar store at night fun place to work
good,"This job was just like any other retail job. It wasn't super hard but it wasn't really a breeze. I had some really good coworkers and an awesome manager! Overall, this is a great entry level place to work and was a great experience."
good,It was fun working there. Customers were the best. Work attitude was fun. Always something to do. Employees were always a handful but great to work with
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General , I loved stocking the shelves and doing plan o grams for new products coming in , the people I worked with became like family"
good,It was an ok job. I got the hours i wanted but the manager didn't know what she was doing. I didn't get paid my first check until 3 week later. That was  one of the reason why  I left.
good,well a  typical work day to me would be clocking in doing my job as best as i can with the best attitude i can bring making sure i stay on top of my duties out though the day and making  people smile
good,"Working at Dollar General gave me the chance to experience what it's be a working adult in today's society. While also being a Full-time college student, it was nice to have a job that was easy to get back and forth to, and also took my busy class schedule into consideration. The work is tedious but bearable. The job is what you make it."
good,"Great enivoroment,fast opportunity to much up ,manager was very flexible in try to help with my employment, consistent on keeping a good place very open with employees,evenly distrubs opportunities to all employees not judgement ,everyone treated equally very enjoyable work enivoroment"
good,when i first started there it was a very bright place and very close to home for me. the manager bob is an amazing manager. he has been the best i have ever had.
good,when I was the assistant manager for Dollar general I enjoyed it very much but I was the lowest paid asm in this area and was refused a raise on several occasions but I would still recommend this job to anyone because it really is a great company to work for.
good,I didn’t have very good managers at my location but it was a relaxed atmosphere . You get written up for any little thing and the turnover rate is extremely high as you can probably imagine that any retail establishment.
good,"It was a great place to work,  airways stayed busy but the pay wasn't that great. Definitely a good job for a student or a side job...................."
good,"I learned how to use the cash register Handle and treat customer with care and respect hardest part of job was was moving U-Boats and Rotainers, It was a very calm work environment most enjoyable part of the job was I learned new things almost everyday there and solving problems by my Manager and coworkers. Very Friendly."
good,Very fun and good place to work. The manger is very laid back and he is very flexible with your hours. The customers are great and makes you enjoy working there.
good,I was a Key Holder. I would open in the morning which i would have to bring the deposit to the bank> Go back to the store and open up when the associcate showed up i gave them their till to open their register. If i closed at night i would have to count all the money tills and get the deposit ready for the morning. I would haave to make sure everything had been done before leaving and locking up the store and setting the alarm.
good,there was great people there a little hard at times depended on what you had to do and who was working if anyone was working at all the manager was awesome worked with anything i need to a point but i was missing to much time with my kids and i couldnt have that
good,The only reason I stayed as long as I did because of the customers and my manager. The co-workers were mean and they hated how I excelled at pretty much all my duties. Very CUT THROAT environment.
good,I would have stayed on if I had been treated fairly by management. The assistant and store manager worked the hours they wanted instead of what they were required.
good,"I didn't get to work there long, there was miscommunication with another employee, the manager didn't take the time to do the schedule well. "
good,"I absolutely loved this job."
good,The store always clean & neat. All the employees nice & helpful every time i go in the store. The prices are reasonable and the manager is awesome . I will definitely be returning.
good,The best part was the customers. Worst part was finding a place for all the extra merchandise. Very high pace and stressful. I learned to be patient and work with you have.
good,I truly enjoyed working for this company. The only downfall was that my hours began to get cut and with the distance to drive to and from work it became somewhat of a financial issue.
good,"Like every job you work, there were some good and some bad managers.  Some managers will promote you some will make an excuse not to promote if they want you in their store because you are good."
good,"Loved what I did, manager was unfair on how he treated employees,if he wanted someone to come in early and they couldn't he cut their hours, would text to let people know they needed to work different hours then scheduled"
good,"I've read a few reviews about how management don't care or whatever, but I guess it depends on who you're under. My store manager is sweet and so are the employees. Even the DM is nice. We all get alone and there is no favoritism. It is a lot to do under so much time.. All will be well if everyone worked together. I have also transferred from another store which the manager did NOTHING. All he would do is sit in the office and eat or walk around talking about employees. "
good,Horrible. 6 days a week required. Associates make minimum wage so impossible to get any quality help. Good employees you do find leave after a month when they find something that pays more. Management  gets stuck doing all the work.
good,My coworkers and supervisor were always easy to get along with. Dealing with customers every day was rewarding. I was responsible for restocking merchandise.
good,Have to have an open availability. Move up fast if you show them you can do the job. Great pay and benefits. Great place to work if you have a great team!
good,"Giving Customer service throughout the day, money handling, stocking the store throughout the day/night, handling customer issues, cleaning the store.."
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General and would have loved to stay but its very hard to live on 13 hours a week. My bosses are amazing and willing to work around my school work when i was at school and family events.
good,The company was very different with the way of doing things. The turnover rate is very high within the company and they expect the employees to do a lot during their shift which sometimes takes away from the customer service part of the job.
good,Dollar general staff are friendly and out going. They treat you as family. Whether you're a co-worker or just a customer. When you need help finding something within the store someone will help you find it.
good,My days working at Dollar General was well relaxed and calm.All the customers that came into the store told me they loved the energry I had. I learned plenty of things while working at Dollar General. The store manager was very rude to her workers and customers.
good,I loved my job and the customers made my job much more enjoyable.   You get paid weekly and if your available to work other store they will offer you more hours of work.
good,"Dollar General  is a good  place to work. You start off part time and you earn your way up. Their lovely people you meet on the way. you have you up and downs working for the company. You learn how to run the store. Run the cashier , stock, recovery, you are always on your toes. Best PART IS THE HOILDAYS."
good,It is a high paced work environment.  The pace is very fast and the work life home balance is very hard to balance as a store manager.  I enjoy my job but looking for more of a balance.
good,Enjoyed my coworkers and the customers that came in to shop. That's all I got. And this stupid thing is making me type more then what I had to say about this job.
good,"I was very happy at dollar general. The job was very slow paced and relaxing for those cold winter days, the key holders, treated the cashiers with respect."
good,"MY manager at my store is very good and flexible with hours. Would recommend as a first job or building experience in retail. It was something for me to get used to, but it wasn't hard to get used to the fast paced and busy environment."
good,This job is the kind of job where just want extra money . They dont give you enough hours to pay anything . My checks were $83 or less every week ....
good,i liked working at this place and my boss was a very nice lady. They worked around my scheduling with my first job and had no problem with the ask off days
good,What i learned from working at Dollar General was how to talk to people and customers in a well behave manner. Ialso learned self control which i thought would be hard
good,the most enloyable part of the job is seeing the regulars. the managment is not very good at setting up a good schedule that gives everyone a fair amount  of hours.
good,Day to day work is like everywhere. You have a set time to get things done and done right. The managers are not so bad but could be better. Love the people I worked with. They were amazing.
good,I liked waiting on the customers.  Didn't mind stocking the shelves during down time at cash register.  Don't train people well and don't give u great opportunities to advance within the store.  Will hire people in over you before giving you the chance to advance.
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar General Enterprises. They are fair about work hours and pay. My favorite part about working with this company was being able to help the public and meet new people.
good,"overall easy job, does require a lot of physical activities. There is opportunity for upward mobility in management, the routines are easy to learn, the operating system is ancient."
good,"I love working at dollar general, fun to associate with customers and help them find what they need in a timely manor. I learned communication skills and how to work in a faster pace environment."
good,"Dollar General can be an excellent company to work for. However, lack of competent management in my current situation has lead me to seek employment elsewhere. The training received will be just enough for you to not be able to advance beyond your superiors. By default lower management and sales associates take the brunt of the willful neglect by upper management."
good,Short days. Pay ok. Benefits not great. Hardest thing was customers being rude even when your trying to make them happy.
good,"At the time of my employment, I had issues with scheduling. Other than that it was a great place to work. Friendly co-workers and management, as well as customers."
good,I loved working there. You just have to be ready for a non set schedule. Typical day at work is stocking shelves and recovering. Everyone always had a smile on their faces whether they were having a bad day or not.
good,Dealing with friendly customers on a daily basis. The manager is very friendly and pleasant to work with. Assistant manager complains more than works.
good,"I loved working for this company, however I worked for a manager who was nice at first but all in all she was hard to work with. I did my job and more but she was very belittling in front of customers and had no respect who worked for her but I do appreciate everything she taught me so I can use that positively in any other job I go for and also coming back to work for Dollar General."
good,I love my job because I'm a people person and I loved my boss but over all it hard and they want one person to do the job of three. You will have to sale your soul just to get on top I knw some people they don't get a day off cuz they don't get enough hours
good,My coworkers make every day a good day. I enjoy working at Dollar General but the pay is small for the responsibilities of a key holder. I learned how to do some management duties such as open and a close the store properly.
good,"i loved working there, but they didn't give me enough hours to work. so i'm hoping to find something better. it was a very easy job. i learned a lot.."
good,some structures and ways of doing things are outdated but other than that the benefits are great if you are in management the hours however are severe
good,"this job was very relaxing and fun, management was AMAZING. i loved working with my co workers. all customers were polite"
good,It was a very functional establishment.  Everyone did their job and didn't put work off on anyone else.  My co-workers were nice enough.
good,"Working the cash register, cash handling, Customer service and ringing up the customer's items. Stocking the selves, putting away items away in the totes. Make sure the store is nice and neat. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers."
good,"assisting customers, operating the cash register, stocking shelves."
good,the company is a good company and they hire a diverse group of employee's but some of the district managers need to be trained on how to work with others
good,Current employee..very fast paced but you have 12 weeks to get up to standard which is a weekly goal of 95% very easy to make goal once your body gets used to it bc it is very physical... Bunch of dramafide coworkers so best to keep to your self... Work no more than 11 hrs a day get 3 days off thurs-sat...awesome pay...awesome bonuses...catered meals for jobs well done...all holidays paid...a lot of vacation time...just an awesome place to work is repetitive tho
good,I didn't use the compensation or benefits or get advanced quickly but the staff I was with was nice and I enjoyed working with the people.
good,"I really enjoyed working at dollar general, management gave me hour's I preferred and was always helpful when I didn't understand something. Being able to see so many people a day and hear how they were doing always kept the day interesting and surprisingly enjoyable."
good,I learned how to manage a shift by myself and help keep a store running. Every day I came in and ran our stock and kept a count on it while also counting our registers and closing the store and making the daily deposit. Management was constant but co-workers kept changing and making my job always changing and adapting. My hardest part of the job was learning how to run a shift but it was also my most enjoyable part.
good,"To me the customers in a small town made the store that much more fun to work at. Not only was I a cashier, but I also stocked and rotated items on shelves, so there was always something to be done, even if no customers were around."
good,THe job is very good if this is your first job it will very much show you what to expect when youre learning to be on your own but don't like to give you many hours
good,"Worked full-time, okay benefits. The turnover rate for District Managers was high. The surrounding area was not a safe place."
good,"Enjoyed  learning new things like management, office work, training, opening and closing the store, running to the bank"
good,It was a nice place to work when the new manager came and took over the store.  Typical retail store that provided good customer service to the general public. Co-workers were nice and got along with everyone. Hardest part of the job was the lack of help on the register. Most enjoyable was learning how to be the third key holder of the store.
good,"good room for advancement dueto high turnover,constant pain from some employees and customers"
good,A typical day started with me coming in at 9 a.m. and prepping food for lunch and every so often prepping food for off-site caterings.
good,"Dollar General offers many chances to advance.  However, they do offer the greatest of benefits."
good,"Helping the dollar genernal from one spot to another it about a week and a temp job but all in and it was good i learned how to stock the shelves with the w the right product reading labels assisting customers the harders part of the job was learning how to read the lables at first it was confusing but once u got the hang of it, it became easier, the most enoyable part was the employees were so helpful and nice, the mangerment was ok, a typical day included coming in clocking in and depending on if u was at the new store or old u either unpack and stocked or packed items"
good,"Cashier"
good,"I started as  a cashier. Then in a year and half I went to different store around the county. As a cashier, then i got my assistant manager. I loved it. Opening the store and closing the store. Unloading the truck. "
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers. the co workers were good, Management was good as well.  The part I enjoyed about my job was the customers."
good,the place was good i loved goin to work everyday. i did everything i was told to do and more..
good,i loved working there has alot to offer friendly enviornment
good,helping customers and being able to move around the store and learn new departments
good,Great place to work.  Hours are good and the people that shop here are usually very nice and friendly. They just want to get what they need and get somewhere they need to be quickly.  Customer service was outstanding in this store.
good,"Working with customers, meeting new people all the time, building relationships with people who come in the store on a constant bases. Dealing with money, and stocking shelves, etc."
good,I learned how to handle money fast and accurately. My manager worked well whit me to train me and help me with any questions I may have.  Co-workers were OK they did not always come in on time or would call in the day of which made for a stressful and difficult shift change. I really liked how many people i got to see day to day.
good,I loved the constant movement and multi-tasking. The hours were not that great. But over all I like dealing with the public.
good,"When I was working for Dollar General, a normal day was interacting with customers and cashing them out at the registers. There was not a lot of employees but they were all easy going and friendly. Our manager was usually on top of things and handled any problems, though there were very few. The hardest part of the job was maintaining cleanliness of the store, though that was not a real chore either. The customers were regulars, who were always friendly and a joy to interact with."
good,"I worked part time while going to college. My co-works were fun to be around, we all worked hard together. I had a great manager. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the floor at closing time."
good,"This job will be easy advancement, but it's not worth the drama between the managers. The cashier lists are too long and will be hard to complete unless the store is never busy."
good,love cashiering just wasnt enough hours always had something to do made the time at work go by very fast
good,I was a clerk and enjoyed speaking and getting to know my customers I developed alot of friendships from this job. My co workers were very nice and so were management.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General would either be me stocking the shelves or being a cashier. I learned how to work the cash register, how to put the merchandise in the right spot at a decent speed and how to work as a team. My mangement was great, we got along great and they helped me with the things I didn't understand. My coworkers and I got along great. They also helped me when I needed it and didn't get all fussy over it. The hardest part of the job was keeping a reasonable speed so I could get everything done on time. But after a week it wasn't a problem for me and I loved the speed and the work. The most enjoyable part about working there was helping and meeting new people."
good,"Learned management duties here, enjoyed being around the customers."
good,This job was challenge and i enjoy every minute of it. I wish i still work that but i was not getting enough hours.
good,dollar general is a good place to work for someone just starting out or just graduated high school its not an easy job it may look easy but its not there is more to do than just running the cash register...i loved my job but i wasn't getting along with some of the people that i worked with so it was time for me to leave...i didn't get along with my manager at all she was trying to be a friend instead of trying to be a manager she only wanted to do that when the district manager came in the store but my overall experience it was a good job and i do miss it
good,I loved working with the people and the customers. it was a great experience working with them. I wish i still could but it went out of business.
good,Running registers and stocking shelves for overtime. Its was very easy and exciting.
good,"I basically ran the store and checked in regularly with my manager, who was in another store."
good,"easy to learn and easy to do, not enough hours because you have to share hours with employees and sometimes your hours get cut back. one of the scanning programs we not benificial to me i wasnt scanning enough items according to the hours. which we live in a small town so every one of my co-workers had a hard time with that program"
good,"Family atmosphere, wide variety of product, Youll establish a great working relationship with employees and customers."
good,Love seeing the Customer's come in the store knowing your name and knowing that the customer will be help in Anyway. It just bring a great feeling to your heart knowing that the customer's feels welcome when they come inside Our store.
good,"I had a good experience working at Dollar General, I kept the store clean and took really good care of the customers. We needed more employees at the location I was at, but with just 3 workers, we kept the store nice and in tip top shape."
good,I feel like they wasnt professional with a lot of things there and that's why they had a lot of issues and was having trouble with the store with the customers and all.
good,Customer based. Constantly evolving expectations that keep you engaged. Distribution leadership. Great place for internal growth and training. Relocation to new facilities as they become available.
good,Be ready to meet and greet customers every day. Always expect the unexpected. Know your surrounding and help people with whatever they need . Work together as a team to keep the store up and running day to day.
good,"The store is stocked, the store stays clean. The prices are great. It's a local store. The staff are great, but the thief problem is out of control. All in all a great store."
good,Worked there for a lil over 2 yrs first manager made the job very stressful but as soon as the assistant manager moved up to manager position it became a great place to work all depends on the manger and how they treat ya
good,You get 5 - 9 hours a week sometimes 14...but not enough to live on...or pay any major bills. This place does not give the security  to live on your own without some other type of income.
good,I was the assistant manger of the dollar general in Toccoa GA. It was a good place to work. The other employees made you fell very welcome and like you were a part of there family.
good,Great job. Wasn’t to far from my house I like the drive. Amazing customers. Show so much support when something need to be done. Sometimes came in a 6 to push produce
good,I really enjoyed working at Dollar General even if the Store manager wasn’t so great. I enjoyed the costumers and interactiving with each and everyone of them.
good,"Not enough money to work so many hours , the people I worked with were nice never had issues there. Mainly just swiping items , then telling them the total . Accept there money and give them there change and recepiet with a smile on my face"
good,Fast learner can work standing for more than 8 hours at a time lifting more than 50 plds ...reliable and well organize  always on time .i know how to use all the warehouse tools properly
good,Personally everyone was on their best behavior they all worked together as a team. While others stood at the side. Dollar general certainly helped me hone my people skills
good,"The pay really sucked, but I enjoyed my job. All if my co workers were extremely friendly and the store manager was very kind, fair, and understanding with all employees which made the job so much easier to tolerate given I wasn't paid that much for the job."
good,I learned how to manage customers needs and floorplans for sales taking inventory  counting tills how to balance the register at the end of the day. Most of all I got to do something different daily
good,Dollar General was a great store to work for I had no complaints about it I was only let go due to my weight limit restriction being lowered. It was a fun business to work for the pay was really low though for my job title.
good,"It's an amazing place to shop and work!!! The environment is very friendly and welcoming. It's always clean in there, stocked efficiently and organized! Employees are sweet and very loving. Very helpful."
good,I opened and closed store which consists of opening and closing safe. Counting tils to get them ready for the work day . Make deposit for store. Do stocking to fill shelves.
good,making people sure people talking care of make sure people not sick i get mad some time i just work i be nice if they if took it to far so it dont make me mad

good,"It’s was Great Company, It was a professional atomspere and Great Place to work.. Benefits and Pay were excellent along with the hours.. I really enjoyed it there.."
good,"I loved working at Dollar General. It is a very fast paced job and you must be a very good multitasker and a fast learner, therefore It worked out great for me."
good,"I personally like working at Dollar General. It’s a good environment to work in, when you have questions people never hesitate on helping you, and everyone on the staff is very nice."
good,Loved working with people every day. Task were simple but time consuming. Loved working with the community and in a team setting.The hardest part of the job was mopping at night time and doing the money count. I loved the fact that they were very flexible as long as I had good communication with my manager.
good,Working at family dollar in the middle of the hood was stressful sometimes  but in all I think the experience was worth it dealing with different types of individuals is always a good experience.
good,"This is one of the best jobs I’ve had. It’s really the only one I’ve had. I was able to be promoted twice in two years. I do not think the pay is fair for what we do and what is dealt with however. They say their a family company, but that’s hard to believe too as the only day we are closed is Christmas. I’m ready for something different and new."
good,"It was an amazing experience working at dollar general, I loved greeting the customers and keeping smiles on there faces. Cleaning bathrooms, mopping and unboxing things and putting them where needed"
good,"Dollar General is a nice job for someone without many responsibilities. Especially if you’re working as only an Sales Associate for several reasons. However, it isn’t the ideal job for someone with many responsibilities and dependable factors."
good,Good starter job. Holiday part time job or career builder ! Many positions all fun to be apart of if your a fast worker and like the do strenuous work. Its not as easy as ppl think. Good place to work over all
good,I really loved the job so much I loved the customs everyone always got along with me they always asked for me they always wanted to talk to me and walk up to me a lot to find stuff cause they knew I remember where everything was and took it right to them my boss was really nice and wonderful in there I loved the work environment we were really busy a lot but I loved it cause I hate not being able to do anything but I had to leave the job because when I became key holder for 5 months or 6 they started making me a lot in the morning and also they would do back to back shifts like second then first second then first and I over slept one time and opened the store late 10 mins so I finally put a 2 weeks notice in since I got word I was getting fired for it cause you don’t open the store late
good,"Customer service,  handling money,  taking care of truck and cleaning up the floor and returns.  Handling all returns and the hand held. Cleaning the restrooms and area."
good,I worked here for about 2 months. I really enjoyed it. Liked the people I worked with. The only reason I left is because my hours got cut and I couldn't afford gas in my car just to drive there for 4 hours a week.
good,"What i learned at Dollar General was to be constant because your always busy, the only hard part was helping customers and always stocking shelves at the same time."
good,Fun place to work great management that was there for my tome there very friendly environment with management that cared about the worker an much as ygey did about the customer an the product sold
good,"I am the ASM at my store and I really love my job and the people I work with, but my manager doesn't listen to any of my ideas, she puts me on the register everyday, and very rarely let's me stock. She spends most of her shifts outside on the phone smoking for 45 min- 1 hr. She doesn't let us recover, so the store looks terrible, and I get complaints from customers about it daily. She is always saying that she doesn't want to be there and has applied for several other jobs. I actually care about my store, my customers, and my fellow employees. She needs to just leave and then maybe I can take over the store and make it great like it was before she cane. Even my customers wish I could be the Store Manager."
good,Great job to work with flexibility and time play. This is a great job for growth and development.  When I come to work they allow me to work at my own pace.
good,"I was the store manager, i loved my job and my team. However i took over a store that was years behind in work including paper work and freight as well as under staffed. In the amount of time i was store manager i rehired the team and caught the store up. To be a new store take over and also a forgotten store away from all the other sister stores in the district, i would spend days at a time at work with just 2 hours of sleep. The company is great company to work for"
good,I worked at the one right by my house and my manager was amazing! He cares about his employees just like they are family. I had to quit as conflict with home life. He was kind and understanding and still asks me how things are in my life and is genuinely interested. The other employees he has hired are all amazing as well and most lifers. He seems to have that one position that he can’t keep filled but the rest have been employed there since I moved to this town like 6 yrs ago.
good,"Generally pretty fast-paced, between customers and cleaning/stocking. Flexible hours to work with my student schedule, so that was nice. Other employees were friendly and easy to work with. Got some small management experience and complied that with my previous retail experience. Overall a fine place to work while in school."
good,"Ringing out customers and helping them find items in the store."
good,"It was a fun  laid back environment, however, you cannot advance.. Other than that, it was a great place to work, getting paid weekly is a plus as well."
good,Even though  I  didn't  stay for too long at this job its was a great experience  I like the work environment the job would sometimes get busy but it was something I could  handle as a team and a leader.
good,"Flexible hours, great employees. One on one with problems with the manager,  fun environment to work in. Amazing customers that are still my friends. Loved the atmosphere of the work place."
good,For a first job it’s great. You work with the same 5 to 6 people everyday and they become like family. A lot of hands on training and the people are always willing to help.
good,"I hated to leave ! had a great bond with my co workers! Very clean , GREAT team work, good atmosphere ! customers were wonderful . Flexible schedule & great management ."
good,Great advancement opportunities great associates all round great smiles and attitudes.good location.easy to get along with but you know not everyone gets along all the time.no one is perfect.pay is fair....
good,"Interesting job.  Fast paced, and can be stressful at times.  But overall it was livable.  Wish they paid better and would have given me a full-time position."
good,You have to be able to multi task rather efficiently and be very patient. The customers are not always friendly. The management doesn't always know what they need to do or how to do it. Almost every task is a team effort. Although you do have the ability to advance rather quickly. I was able to receive overtime when I was offered the opportunity to assist in remodels of other stores.
good,"dollar general is a great place to start out at as a young kid "
good,I Loved My Job At dg Loved the People I worked with And my schedule. I Got To Meet new People And Out smiles on faces every day of me being there. I would tell others Apply there you’ll love it.
good,Houston i like it i got into it with a person tgere got mad i hate that. The pay was alright the hrs was horrible. Very safe made sure it was lock at all times when closing time
good,"Need more hands on training"
good,"If you just need a little extra cash or time out of the house, this job is for you!!! They have very flexible hours and are very understanding about needing time off or needing extra hours."
good,Dollar general is a Fast pace at work and stocking it’s a great job but less pay and I learned how to deal with customers and there attitudes the hardest part is going back and forth stocking and cashier and the most enjoyable part of working is my co workers but most of all i love my job
good,"This was a nice place to work. Steady pace job and friendly people. My management team was awesome! I learned quite a bit working there,especially customer service."
good,"Great in all areas except Management. all benefits are great, policy are easy to follow same as the procedures easy to learn advancement oppurtunities"
good,"Always stayed busy and enjoyed the customers, as well as being creative on making the store how I wanted too. I made a lot of changes in the store for the best and took awhile to get it all cleaned and  organized."
good,"This was my first job and at first I was so shy and quiet- but once I got to know my coworkers and my store manager I relaxed quite a bit. Sure, there was a relatively high turn around (lot of people came and went in the 2 1/2 years I worked there) but I got to befriend most of them. "
good,I enjoyed working there. Everyone was nice a friendly. The cashiers work well with others and the managers worked just as hard. It's a great part-time job to have.
good,This is a great company to work for. Yet the pay really sucks. Traveling to set up other stores isn't bad and if you enjoy it then you can always volunteer. They promote from within. They have no maternity leave and will fire you if you aren't able to work until the Dr releases you to go back after having a baby.
good,"good job hard to find good employees management sucks"
good,I was very pleased with the fast pace and client based relations. Clients became very friendly with the location and enjoyed being among workers who appreciated them. My reasons for leaving were solely based upon lack of advancement;
good,"Work was fast paced, your constantly moving.  Being able to work as a Sales Associate gives me the opportunity and experience I need to move forward. I love people and being able to meet new people everyday."
good,Everyday challenged me to improve my skills within myself to become the best employee i could be. I learned and took from my experience there to better my experience and grow as a professional to succeed in the professional work environment. I took what i learned with me and used it for further employment opportunities to exceed above and beyond what was expected of me daily to do the best job I could myself.
good,great experience friendly people and staff enjoy working at Dollar General hopefully i'll get more hours great place to work Manager s are nice and seem to help when I'm at their store.
good,"stocking"
good,This job was a temporary position for me but it was a great environment and I enjoyed the people that I worked with. The only reason I left was better career opportunities.
good,"Even though its stressfull at times this job will keep you busy. And thats one thing i like. "
good,At first a great place to work but once your there for awhile the hours are long and hard on the body and not great for people with family when your working 60 hours or more.
good,I absolutely loved working there.  The managers were very nice and they treated me like family.  The employees are absolutely amazing to work with.  I enjoyed going to work everyday.
good,"A great place to start your retail career, plenty of opportunities to move up if you’re a hard worker and a great way to gain experience. Very competitive with other store in the district"
good,The hiring process was slow but once I started I absolutely loved it! Working for the company it was relatable cut and dry and it had a wonderful training program
good,"The company is growing in an exciting way and there are tremendous opportunities.  Expectations for supervisors are very very high, but so is the pay.  Days are long and work/life balance is a real issue."
good,I liked working at Dollar General the staff were all like family and everyone got along. Typical day at work going in clocking in and going up to register and they aren't really that busy except around the holidays. So on my down time I would clean and stock the shelves and anything else that may be on the agenda for the day.
good,"If you're looking for a job in New Ipswich, look elsewhere than the New Ipswich Dollar General. The manager is unbearable and has reprimanded employees (myself included, in front of a store with customers in it no less) for following company policy since it made a customer mad. There are other Dollar Generals and the one in New Ipswich is one to definitely skip past."
good,"Working with the public, meeting people everyday, Making sure employees did what was expected on my shift. made sure they greeted every body that entered the store."
good,"Learned alot fast pace place to work"
good,"I will-never work the manager that was there ever again. She was very rude, not understanding to my condition even though she said she understood and her daughter went there the same thing."
good,Being a cashier and a stock organizer was definitely worth while for which customers were gladly walking in to find their day's worth met. Long lines of shoppers really provided a sense of inclusion for the company than it would have been for larger retail stores.
good,"work as hard as i can to help people to find things they need for they need and wants, the people i work with was very nice we became a family and help each other with everything we was a team"
good,Working as an employee for Dollar General became a benefit to me to learn. I enjoyed working with the public and helping customers have a great experience shopping at Dollar General.
good,"It;'s good job to have but not for temparary. its relaxed nice pace, friendly. it's an easy job, i really liked it even though management sucked. the hardest part was learning recovery."
good,A typical day at work we would get everything stocked and make sure the customers were taking care of. If it was not to busy and everything was done for the day we would talk for a bit about things coming up. My boss at the time was a really great guy. He always made work a little easier by making it seem fun. The place just felt like another home. We were all a work family and I enjoyed working with them all. The hardest part was having to leave.
good,Temporary/Seasonal position. Enjoyed the time I was employed there. The manager was great and the other staff was nice to work with. I would work for this company again.
good,Doller general gave me a good experience. It taught me how to be a sales person. It also taught me how to multitask. It's a good job for someone in school.
good,Great  place to start off as a first job if you have never  been behind a register. Its tottaly  a good place to build skill and  a good work ethic along woth working with peers and  witnessing  unusual but   all round good things  can happen from this store/workplace  i would tottaly advise  some one to work here.
good,Great company to work for.  Team works together to get job done. Cleanliness of store .  Great customers regular customers you get to know by name and them you.  Just for me not enough hours per week.
good,If they had offered me a job after setup I may have still been there. I don't know about their benefits now but the company as a whole is ok to work for.
good,"I learned the proper way to stock shelves,unload u-boats and recovery of shelves. I enjoyed my co-workers and my supervisor and their willingness to help."
good,if by any chance you have seen my last review about trad I'm laughing. what are the odds that you would click on both of my reviews xD sometimes I wonder oh wait I'm done. sweet.
good,It had its days some were good some were bad but the good days out ways the bad days.  The employees were ok on most days as well.   But i loved my job and felt great being at work
good,"A typical work day at Dollar General is at the start of each shift we count our drawer to make sure it is right for the work day. I have learned to lead the shift, check in the vendors, and work the truck. Management is good. The culture is unique and to the point. They follow each procedure and guideline strictly by the book. The hardest part is seeing a customer leave without making a purchase because they couldn't find what they were looking for due to it being out of stock or it has been discontinued. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting the customers and getting to know them each visit."
good,"A typical work day would consist of cleaning cash register area, stocking HB&A,team meetings, working the front end cash register and greeting as well as helping customers have the most enjoyable shopping experience and walk out extremely happy. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new customers and making them smile. also, assisting them in anyway i could. the hardest part of my job was dealing with theft. management was very friendly and respectable. woking here i learned how to push sales, work with different personalities and solving conflict. As well as recovery and stocking."
good,I love my job but i don't have a good team to support me there and that make your job hard because your there pulling doubles like crazy other then that its great
good,"I worked at dollar general for a year and a month . I was giving a management position but it took me a while to get that all straight. Then right before I left I asked for a higher management poation and was told I was that kind of employees and that I would probably get it , but came to work and found out she had hired someone off the street for that job. That's when I had had enough of the lies and b.s. . so I left"
good,"I usually get there at closing time but the customers are what make the job so fun and relaxed. The employees there are friendly, hardworking and motivated.."
good,"This is a good first job. Its small and easy to manage, if you work hard there is a good chance you will be promoted quickly. I enjoyed working here very much."
good,co workers were fine to be around some of the things the management would tell us to do wouldn't make sense i learned how to  use different equipment and programs its is very fast pace in which i didn't mind best part of the job was the interaction with my co workers
good,I worked with friendly people who were easy to talk to and I enjoyed making conversation with and helping customers. The work was really easy and I had little to no questions about it all.
good,"bad management , doesn't work well with employees needs. Loved working for the company and getting paid every week but management was horrible. Not and equal opportunity place to work big turnover rate."
good,As long as your a hard worker. It's a easy place to work. It has high expectations but easily met. They expect you to follow schedules and do all assigned tasks. If you get a good manager you will have a good team to complete all tasks in a timely manner.
good,"Great company to work for!  Great benefits and more, co-workers are nice and also great environment, great hours and lots of overtime whenever wanted."
good,"I enjoyed working here as a sales associate. I got along with everyone I worked with even management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers because we had some who threatened us and some who would just cause a big scene over nothing, just for being ID'd or thinking an item was on sale but never was because they read the coupon wrong."
good,"not a bad to work for younger kids, of, if you're planning to go up the ladder, into management. there was always something to do, which made the days go by quickly"
good,"The managers are helpful if there is a situation that you yourself can't handle. Give employee the empowerment to make decisions. As long as you take care of the customers don't steal, clean, and recover the job is easy as cake."
good,Moving up the ladder is awesome at this company. Everyone is very nice and will train you very well. All of the customers are really nice and is very understanding when you do get busy and have a small line going never had a problem loved working there.
good,it was an okay place to work. my day basically consisted of running the register and stocking. it was an okay but sometimes unstable work environment and we could never keep a steady manager
good,"took care of customers, counted down drawers at the end of day and made bank statements for deposits, did returns , stocked the store, damages, and reported every item"
good,Some of the store does not have enough help so its too little help not enough time to do the work. if work is slow they send you home before time you get off.
good,I worked there at the dollar store for a bought  couple months I got paid every Friday not much but it was something to get me an d m y kids threw the week
good,".Great Managers"
good,I am a people person I strive hard to develope a good patient and customer relationship meeting their needs is my priority. I love to make others feel comfortable in my presence and I always give a smile
good,"I was unfortunate to be assigned to a location that was highly corrupt. The overall concept of expected operations is good, but it is impossible to find good people to work in some of these stores."
good,I enjoyed my job. I moved and it was getting to expensive to travel to work. It's a great company to work for. The pay it not so great but it have a high chance of advancement
good,"Working at dollar general is a laid back job really. being a keyholder when you start your midday shift you count drawers. Then you make the midday deposit. After all the money work is done, you know exactly what to do. for example some nights you had to recover shelves or just continue any stocking that wasnt finished on truck day. the coworkers are easy to get along with. the hardest part of the job was truck day having to be at the job at 4am."
good,My  biggest tip is security safe in front of store I don't think this is safe frei g t is good  are stay organized because management isn't all on one page an the turn around an theft is big why is it because it's hard to watch a whole store when it's only two people working
good,"I liked doing this job. It was a variety of things I had to do.  It kept me busy. I scanned items, cleaned store, unloaded trucks, stocked shelves, ran the cash register. I really liked the assistant manager she was very nice and pleasant to work for. The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks. It was very cold."
good,"I really like working there, we have great employees, we try to get as many things done as possible. we also try to help the customers find everything they need quickly and efficiently."
good,This job will keep you on your toes. There are bad days where customers make your job hard but other than them. You only have to worry about if your getting an equal share of work hours or not.
good,A fast passed very hungry company that I enjoyed being a part of and was giving the chance to grow to better myself and my family. Offered great benefits could have paid a little better and hired better district managers but nun the least its a good place to be
good,A typical work day included running the register. Always something to do but sometimes they would expect the impossible how much they want you to do while still tending to your customers in a timely fashion.The management was very good there. The other employees were very nice only 1 slacker out of the group of us that other employees picked up the slack for. The hardest part of the job was having to so many totes stocked an hour while still running a register and tending to customers questions.The most enjoyable part for me was the customers and knowing I could make them smile.
good,Be better managed if the boss was doing her job and not playing favoritism and not having her key holder and assistant manger do all the work but other than that its very good place to work for and have fun doing it
good,The pay for the amount of work that has to be done is not worth the headache. I basically loved the job because it was close to my home. Due to medical problems I had to let the job go.
good,"I thought this was an easy job, the task that were shown to me were very much that of common sense, and our location provided us with many local regulars which made it nice to go in and meet people everyday."
good,A typical day a wok is going in and getting on a register and waiting on customers and putting stock away. Some of the co-workers are easy to work with some are lazy.
good,"Typical day at work was crazy busy. I learned how to open and close the store. Management was good. Some of my co-workers were nice. The hardest park was truck day, and the most enjoyable part was when I closed the store."
good,"You always have something to do, you don't stand around with nothing to do, wasting time. I love being productive and being able to do and try new things. I am always learning something new."
good,I really enjoyed working at Dollar General. My co-workers were wonderful. I also enjoyed getting to know my customers. I learned how to be team player.
good,A friendly environment and a place that works as a team.  Schedules are flexible for the most part.  The management team is friendly as a re co-workers.  I love being around all the customers!
good,"A typical day at Dollar General was walking in and counting down my till to start my day, the usual swiping of bar codes across the laser scanner. I would work cash register and sometimes employee's would flip tasks and I would be the one putting merchandise on the shelves. After performing these tasks for so long I learned to pick up the pace and I learned all the key parts to putting away merchandise on shelves correctly and i learned to do it much more faster. "
good,"MY MANAGER MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS WANTED AT THIS JOB, Enjoyed the experience!"
good,Was able to move up in positions fairly quickly. Was trained to the best of their ability and was taught how to deal with a rude customer. I enjoyed helping customers.

good,Liked working there there could be more to the pay but its ok they need to have more benefits for their employees and better pay for their management team
good,"Dollar General was a great leaning opportunity. I had a lot of responsibilities and had a chance to do a little of everything, except manage. This was the first job that made me feel as if management could be for me."
good,"The best part of this job was the leadership role I got to play. I made key holder pretty fast. The worst part was the fact that because it was a small town store, the managers did not care much about the store or the workers."
good,"Structured work environment."
good,In a typical day at work I greet customers and cash them out when needed. Overall the place is in good standing with me. I learned that great customer service is everything at a retail store.
good,Dollar General is a wonderful place to work.  I enjoyed my time but there was a lack of employee appreciation when I was working there.  It is a great company to grow in and it was fairly easy to get a promotion.
good,It was different learning experience but it was good meeting and interacting with different people on a day to day basis i wish they would have kept me employed
good,Manager needed better people skills. Store was always cleaned I always came in on my days off when needed. I enjoyed my customers and my co workers

good,"While working in Memphis, I was blessed to have met a guy who I knew while in college.  He reassured me that if I listen and take heed to his management approach in retail, I could apply to any industry."
good,This was a great job with great management. I was the Assistant Manager. I loved working with the employees that also worked there. It was a very interesting job that kept me busy everyday. There was always stuff to do which made the day go by fast. I had a lot of responsibility which I loved.
good,"•	Support one or more managers, supervise cashiers and store merchandise while working in medium to high-level complex environments. "
good,"On a typical day at Dollar General, I would be providing customer service as the lead cashier to consumers on the daily basis. During my time with this company, I learned how to multi-task, deal with all types of attitudes, and the value of hard work.  The hardest part of the job was getting called in on your day off and the most enjoyable part was seeing familiar faces that you haven't seen in awhile that comes to Dollar General to shop."

I learned how to do deposites, how to use the hand held device, how to follow plan-o-grams and do my best as a floor attendant. My manager was good to and very helpful person with employees and customers. The hardest part of my job was calling the police on the handful of kids a caught shop lifting, only because the were really young for them to start having a record. =I enjoyed my job here because, my co-workers and i worked together to number 2 store in our district."

good,Come to work and count my drawer. Then i would greet customers and put up stock. Ive learned how to be more patient with people and that the customer is always right. I had amazing co-workers.

I made sure that what I was working on, was done before my shift was over. When I worked at other stores things were different than my store I was hired at but I still worked hard!"
good,"It was alright, easy enough work just doeant pay alot in the begininng. Customers are customers. Managers can be really good depending on who it is. Coworkers are easy to get along with. And the hours can be draining cause youll work a few hours but almoat everyday depending if you're full time or part time. Schedules change every week sometimes more."
good,Its a great workplace. The employees work great together. I learned how to get over my fear of working with people. It would be awesome if the employees could have better working equipment (computers ect.)
good,"Could always get more hours if needed. Possible travel pay if they need you to work at a store that isnt your usual store. Job is fairly easy. Hardest part is learning the stores' item locations so you can stock quickly and efficiently."

good,Loved my manager. But the upper management was terrible ... I enjoyed my work and was advanced to a management position within 3 months of working there.
good,Always seen to have staffing issues and pay was low. The environment was pleasent. Upper management was willing to work with you when they had time. I did like it it was stressful at times though.
good,My job at Dollar General stores was to make sure all employees were trained properly. Make sure the safe was ready for the shifts for the day. Go to the bank and deposit our money into the bank and pick up extra money in case because we got busy a lot
good,Working at Dollar general had been a chill experience. No complaints come to mind. Just not much hrs of work and could use a p/a system. Coworkers are cool and customers are tollarable.

good,"Working at dollar general allowed me to learn my own potential in a work environment. Working there allowed me to grow in my career, and there was potential for growth."
good,I loved working there I was Just never given the chance to move up in the company because supposedly didn’t have “Open Availability” which untrue I either had to work days or nights cause I have two toddlers at home. So out of almost 2 years would never promote me to a key holder but that’s okay just wasn’t meant to be but enjoyed working there other than that
good,"It is a fast paced place to work. Especially on Thursdays time flew by, I helped unload and stocked the shelves from the truck until my shift was over."
good,The store I worked at was very organized and awesome.  The people who worked with me was relaxed and cool. We all worked as a time and made sure everything was done. We all helped in every which way. The manager was the best she stayed on us but the store was always in tip top condition

good,"The store I have Is an older one. Hours are long and the pay could be better, but I love being there. Hard, fast paced work. My DM could be much better."
good,When working you always have something to do no matter what. Everyone works together as a team I think that’s what makes me like dollar general so much.

good,"The Good : great customer's , amazing coworkers, shift s go by fast"

good,Loved working here. I had great employees and we were like a family. Welcomed any new customers and employees. Very understanding and patient. There was never a problem I couldn't go to my managers about. Store was always kept clean and tidy. Customers were nice. We were very patient and honest with the impatient or rude customers. Dollar General will be missed.
good,"hardest job I ever did, a lot of work and only get pay 7.50 hour. i learned that this job is for teenage  who need a job. the most enjoy part of the job is nice manger"
good,"Fast paced, productive, good customer and co-worker relations, constantly busy which makes time go by fast, get to know regular customers who are very caring."
good,Overall dollar General is a great place to work if you like working hard. Very fast paced and great for learning customer service skills. Dollar General is all about the customers.
good,"pretty good job, laid back and loved the work environment, manger was a good guy, but sometimes had a bad attitude, and seem a bit of anger issues, but it was nothing too bad."
good,Love the customers and people I worked with. The job was very easy each and everyday you knew what needed to be done. Everyone was dedicated and made sure the objective was met everyday.
good,"the job is easy enough, just unload boxes and run the cash register. The biggest complaint with this job is lack of pay and hours. But the management more than makes up for that."
good,"Dollar General is a great store to work at because it never gets too busy so you don't have to worry about being too stressed out, and it is normally just you and the manager on duty so you don't have too many people to worry about getting along with."
good,A typical day at work would be that we have a lot of busy days with many people waiting to be checked out at the register and have other employees stocking.
good,"I liked working at Dollar General because I love to see my customers and employees satisfied. A typical working day would be getting customers in and out with the ability that they will be shopping here again. I have learned that not all customers will be satisfied no matter how hard you help them. I love my management team since I am apart of the team, I love my co workers since we all make each other day and work as a team and when we walk away to go home, we are eager to come back the next day to work."
good,Working at Dollar General was a good work environment but I never got my hours and I waited for a year to get the hours she promised me before I put in my two weeks notice
good,"Dollar general is a good place to work at, It’s a steady work place. When you have free time or not working with any customers you can stock things until somebody come to the cashier to check out then go back to stocking."
good,"Definitely a down to earth place to work, it’s local and you know everyone that comes in. you build relationships with customers and it’s more a relaxed environment."
good,"stocking sales floor cashiering, helping customers out,i learned how to open and close the store and payroll, managment was ok but some didnt follow the rules,the hardest part of the job was stocking the sales floor,"
good,"I loved all of the staff i worked with, and my store manager was so nice and understanding. Overall, it was such a great working environment where everyone supported each other!"
good,"It a awesome job i love it i wouldnt mind working there again , i love the money the customer were nice , it was a nice experienced , i love that we got paid weekly its awesome"
good,DG is a good company to promote in. Pay could be more competetive. Work schedule is only 1 day off a week. Would be better for home life at 2. Bigger payroll would be nice.
good,it was a good place to work had smiling faces when shopped there they seem to work well with manager. store was clean and restrooms were clean. i shop there at least 2 times a week
good,I only worked a few hours a week. I left because I moved out of state but now returned to area. The store was a newer store so nice setting.  The store was a busy store.
good,"Dollar General is a great place to work, work is hard but manageable, meet great ppl and work great hours. You able to move up and excel in the business."
good,I truly enjoyed my days of work at dollar general because we worked together we greeted each and every customer with a smile we helped them with whatever the need was if it was something we didn't have at our store we would call the next closest store to help that customer the store manager was very professional at all times and we got many great reviews on our store.
good,I work in the distribution center & my pay is great! I just hate the long hours and being away from my kids a lot. The benefits are great as well also. We also work crazy hours so you know what time you go in but never know what time you are getting off.
good,To be honest wonderful work in my opinion. I enjoyed the pace as it can be different jobs per day but on average the day is very much about the customers sales and keeping the shelfs stocked.
good,A day at Dollar General is relaxing. You will get used to the same customers coming by to say hello and purchase there normal items. This is a good enviroment
good,"It was very productive and it allowed me work on my communication skills. A typical day at work how be like stocking items on shelf's, talking to different, and even helping someone that was elderly."
good,"It’s a good job if your just starting out , but it’s not a job you should get if you are to maintain certain lifestyles . Only way you can is if your on salary also it’s good cause you get paid every week"
good,"The place was awesome. Friendly coworkers. Whenever there was a problem, the manager solved it fairly quick. You get to know the customers as time goes by"
good,I love working here.  I meet all kinds of nice people and I get to carry on conversations with some of them about different things.  I love helping them find products or help them carry their bags out to their vehicles.  This is a challenging job. I love the people that I work with and hope to find more of the same on my next job.
good,"It was a learning experience working for Dollar General because of the miscellaneous items that are throughout the store. From medicine, clothing, to house supplies. You find that working there you will find a lot of things that you didn't know that were in the store."
good,"The Dollar General I worked for was relaxed, but not boring. The whole staff did their job well and efficiently. We all got along since there we're 9 max that worked in the store and only two or three of us working at a time for day and night shifts."
good,I love working at dollar general only  bad thing its the benefits but other than that its a good place to work flexible hours specially of you're in school respectful and understandable in difficult times.
good,"My typical day at work was restocking and customer services."
good,"it is a really stressful place. but once you get used to it, it becomes fun . The people that work there re fun and become like your family. It is really easy to move up in the company."
good,"My manager was amazing, my co-workers were amazing. The environment was laid back yet fast paced. The day mainly consisted of making sure your customers are happy, and want to come back. Maintaining a clean and safe store."
good,"I loved working at Dollar General my Store Manager was awesome and he actually cared about his staff. A typical day was to come in and to count a til, greeted guests, assisted guest with finding items, handling monetary transactions, placed items on shelves in correct place. Management was awesome always working as a team. The culture was good. Hardest part is trying to place items on the floor and get a certain amount of work complete and ringing customers as well. The most enjoyable part is working, I loved to work the customers also made it quite enjoyable as well."
good,"there really wasn't a hard part, only when you stocking the shelves and cant reach certain shelves because your to short. Sometimes I would mix the candy and put them in the wrong spot but there is someone that comes by and check behind you."
good,"Loved working at DG. Great company and great culture, great management, company drives a culture of creating an inclusive work environment. They promote from within."
good,It  was  an  okay  job.  I  would  have  liked  to  have  been  able  to  stay  but  was  unable  for  personal  reasons. The  manger  at the time  was great.
good,Loved my job but my circumstances changed and had to go another way but would recommend to anyone.My 11 years there went fast.I gained a lot of knowledge and made lifelong friends as well as getting to watch children grow and get to know my community.
good,"Dollar General was a great place to work for. "
good,"A typical day would consist of stocking shelves, waiting on customers, working with planagrams. The management was good they would listen to what the associates had to say. There really wasn't a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public."
good,Great place to work foe beggining in retail. very easy and paid wekly with premotion availiblity. the type of business were you could grow and really learn new things.
good,Would of stayed but found something else closer to home when at a different address. Manager was very nice to work for. I would work there again it is a friendly place.
good,"You just treat dollar general like you would your house, all youre doing is making sure labels are showing, keeping the aisles clean, sweeping and mopping."
good,It was very cool when I started . I like it still it's very smooth but you have to be fast paced because a lot of customers come and they get angry fast if they are there to long.
good,It was a comfortable place to work. Nice people/co-workers. The managers were great people. You always stayed busy but not too busy. It wasn't a stressful type of job at all. They have us fun ways to get customers to donate money to charities.
good,"Dollar General is obviously not a job to work if you're looking to support a family, it's not full time, hours arent guarenteed. But it was fun and I will always remember it that way."
good,overall company great however in the area I lived and worked didn't have enough hours and pay was less than minimum wage increase pay and create more advancement opportunities over management and co-workers were awesome
good,"I would love to have this job back, but they chose to not rehire me when I tried to apply.  I will reapply again and hope I get picked!  The money is really good here, but the benefits are expensive.  I really felt the management here go above and beyond to make the workplace as good as possible.  At the end of the day it's a warehouse, and so it has some drawbacks to it that cannot be worked around.  It's hard, dirty, heavy work, but the management staff know the employees work hard.  They feed you a lot of free lunches and things, and just try to make the environment as pleasant as possible.  I remember when they set up a section of the warehouse to just have games there.  We had a basketball hoop, beenbag toss, etc.  Man.  I wish they would hire me back.  They really focus on safety, too."
good,While working for Dollar General. They will work you for little pay  and you will do every little task that is required of you. They cut hours with no warning ! It will be great if they can appreciate their workers because they do all the work and they make it so complicated.
good,i loved working at the store. so many friendly people my co workers were the best i had a great working experience until i got fired while i was in the hospital
good,"Great work environment, to teach young people the value of a job . Management team is very good at doing there job on daily work week .  Provides  great  assistance in training there employees"
good,It was an overall good experience. Would recommend to people willing to work face paced. It's a good job for high school students during the summer. Also people who are friendly and able to multitask.
good,"I liked this company, first retail company i work for. Good first experience. The hardest part of the job was dealing with coupons or couponers, they were always difficult because the computer system was old, like from the 90s. And customers who stole. Counting the money and closing having that sense of responsibility was the most enjoyable part, as well as meeting nice, new customers."
good,"The hours were very long, There was times when I would work off the clock.  The customers were amazing and Most of the people that I worked with were great"
good,"Dollar General is a highly competitive company and has mind set of being #1 in the ""small box"" perspective and they where. The training was intense but through. The benefits were getting better, I've learned more about running a store than any where else that I have been. It was more hands on and had upper level help."
good,The management was great were very willing to train and work out any difficulties. Very good crew that I led loved working here. Had to leave because of family emergency but this place will definitely have you feeling accomplished at the end of the day.
good,"Working at Dollar General was pretty straight forward. I go and Count my Register Till, and then tend to the Customers until the Manager on duty brings out some truck for me to stock when I have available time."
good,It was great the only problem was the manager. You learn a lot about working with others and different customers. I would love to work for this company again.
good,Dollar General is a great place to work if you never wanna be home. The management could have been a lot better and the staff was poorly chosen. My manager was really sweet and considerate
good,"For the right person who enjoys retail this job would be a great fit. You always have something to do, so there is very little ""down time"". Be ready to be quick on your feet and quick with your reactions to customer complaints."
good,I enjoyed working here. I learned a lot about handling money and interacting with customers. The management was awesome. She was very nice and understanding to her employees. The hardest part of the job was the truck. The most enjoyable was helping the customers.
good,"Being at dollar general I learned that making the job fun counts. Smiling and keeping the customers smiling is a plus. When you are a happy worker it tends to make the customer happy, and they always come first. The managers are very understanding and they  get their work done. They do their best at working around your time schedule. I must say it was a great experiences working in the environments with different cultures, who play different roles. The hardest part of my job was leaving when my shift was over. I enjoyed everything about the dollar general experience from managing my register to stocking shelves."
good,You stay busy with new resets and making sure everyone is happy and all money paperwork is filed and accounted for customer service is a must if you as a person dont give your customer the best at home one on one feeling i can bet they wont return.
good,Love to work for the company but I think the pay was very poor so that's why I decided to move forward for a better paying job.
good,I absolutely love working for dollar general. I only think it is time for a change to where I can be home more with my son since I am a single mother. At the moment I work almost every weekend. If I could be promised 40+ hrs a week and only work 8-5 I wouldn't leave my position.
good,The work place is awesome I get along with majority of every one who works with me. But I have to agree with others it's hard to move up unless store manger want you to. Most DM's don't pay attention to no one unless you are a assistant or store manager for months I been trying to move up to Assistant an still I been getting the run around. I'm currently trying to take a job in another state just to be able to move up
good,A good working establishment with a comfortable working environment with determining team staff.that I would refer any one to this establishment.
good,Dollar General is a nice place to work.  Store is organized and employees and management are great to work with.  This particular store is close to my home and the hours are convenient for my family.
good,The bad part about working for dollar General is there mangment team is not good at all other the the mangers everthing and everone else way ok
good,"Lacking when it comes to respect for employees"
good,"Dollar gneral is a great place to work if you are just looking for a descent paying job. It is very physical and I am exhausted at the end of the day but i have weekends off and paid holidays. My only issue is it seems very difficult to move up and make it a career. There is opportunitys because of there expansion to the west coast, but an average of 5 years to make your first move up to supervisor, doesnt sound too promising to me."
good,Overall great job love the weekly pay. Day would go by fast always had something to do. Management was iffy had 3 managers. One good manager. Like my co workers usually.
good,"it""s a great place to work. my co-workers are fun, hard working, and friendly. We work as a team. The customers are usually all friendly and kind! I recommend this job!"
good,"A typical day involved ringing up customers and stocking the shelves, not too difficult. I learned alot when it comes to management skills and communication. My manager was the nicest person. He always tried his best and really listened to what you had to say about anything. My co-workers were the same. We were one big family at the store. everyone looked after one another and had so much fun working together. You couldn't come into the store without leaving with a smile on your face. They were so funny and loving. The hardest part of the job was really just dealing with some of the ruder customers, which didnt happen very often. Management was always on top of it and haandled it very well. The most enjoyable part of working at DG was pretty much everything else. I LOVED working for this company. Every day I was excited to go to work. I loved all my coworkers and the customers. Although, there really wasn't much security, which is my main reason for leaving. Overall, I loved this job and I miss it greatly. I made many good friends and I actually became best friends with the assistant manager! We became instant friends when i started working there and now we hang out all the time. Working at DG was my favorite job ever!!!!"
good,"Its an organized job,that require social skills and responsibilities such as customer service and stocking cleaning and so forth"
good,"Dollar General was a good company that offered a decent pay rate, and a chance to advance after a few months. The most enjoyable part was the people that shopped there. I felt that i was in their lives sometime when I would help them find what they needed and they left the store happy."
good,It is a priviledge to work at Dollar General. I learn new things about being a manager on a day to day basis. Most of the co workers are nice and i love to work with and we have a few that i just speak to and go on and do my work. other than that i am proud to be a Dollar General employee
good,Its been a great experience. continuously learning alot and gaining experience and getting to know people at new stores. the working environment is cool and the people are cool! its just not as I was expected as in the beginning.
good,i learned that its a job weather your safe or not its your job all they expect is for you to go in even if your store has been robbed
good,"As a cashier, you deal with people one on one. You solve problems, complete requests, clarify issues and work with other employees. As a result, your communication and social skills develop. Later, you can put those improved skills to work in a new job or for personal projects.Cashiers often have to handle more than one task simultaneously. For instance, they might complete a transaction or check inventory on the computer while answering the store phone. The ability to multitask translates to greater efficiency in virtually any job you might take in the future, as well as in your personal life. In the business world, this ability and the resultant efficiency sometimes means promotions or pay raises."
good,Fast paced environment. You will never find a time when there is not something that needs to be taken care of. Freight is never ending.
good,"When you get there you hit the ground running.  You must be able to mutli-task between cashiering, cleaning and stocking. You must also be able to provide excellent customer service."
good,"Enjoyed being a key holder for this company! However when the store manager runs off for days on end while you're in the middle of a promotion, and the district manager then promotes someone else who has no idea how the company runs makes you want to run for the hills! I would love to work for them again, but the district manager would have to be different."
good,Love the benefits of working at the store support center. There is an on site cafeteria and work out facility. I would recommend working for Dollar General.
good,"Great people, great experience, all HR duties. "
good,I have had several jobs since leaving the school system but none have been as enjoyable and rewarding.  When a person can learn and much as he or she teaches you can not ask for a better career.
good,I absolutely loved working for Dollar General. I would go back in a heartbeat if I could. There were occasional disputes between the manager and other co-workers because there was a lot of trash talk. They are really good about working with you on your schedule and the environment is all around great.
good,Great work place loved the manager would still be there if i could've worked around the scheduling. Wish the pay was higher though
good,This good was a great learning experience. It was great working with the public to learn how to deal with different situations.
good,Its a place that definitely keeps you busy. Fast paced environment. Good place to work. Room for advancement and relocation
good,I absolutely love the co workers i work with.  The hardest part of my job is working almost every single weekend.  My typical work day is stocking shelves doing recovery and checking customers out.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of pleasing the customers, I learned a lot with this being my first job. The management wasn't the greatest but they helped as much as they could. My co-workers were awesome, when you needed help with something all you had to do was ask for help and they were right there helping. The hardest part of the job was in between shifts, having to run three different positions at one time was rough while the person taking over your spot was counting their drawer. The most enjoyable part of my job was that no matter if anyone one was in a bad mood, they were always easy to cheer up."
good,I love working for Dollar General. I love people and always having something to do. Being a single mother I love the flexible work hours.
good,"A typical day at work was fun and productive, I love my co-workers at DG. The most important thing I learned would be how to deal with and react to very negative customers and prevention loss. Management was great at first but we then lost our manager and never really gained back a manager that could fill his shoes. My co-workers were the best in town. The hardest part of my job was the negative and rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was recovery because it was a quick and easy task."
good,The People are nice and the job is easy going. I stock boxes and load trucks. The hardest part is gathering everything together.
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday, and as long as you were willing to show that you were there to work there were no issues.  It may not be a good job for a single parent, but for a high school or college student I think it would be perfect."
good,"I truly enjoy the atmosphere at this job. A typical day would include cashier duties, cleaning the store, socializing with the customers, and having a manager that I can trust and communicate with around at all times."
good,"I loved this job here, great people great work place. I loved this job and my managers mad me job easier"
good,The Management are competent. I have seen people advance past me though. I have noticed about this company. At least the area I'am in the management are all female and mostly in in the early to mid 20's.
good,"A typical day at work was Very fun. I loved making people laugh and it was just amazing. I learned at this job that it is ok to be yourself, most people will love who you are if you are a positive person. The original managing team that hired me was very down to earth and was such a great team. Unfortionally once a new manager is hired, she or he has to hire a whole new team. There honestly was nothing hard about the job. It can be fast paced, of course you have to do several things at once, but this job is very easy. The most enjoyable experience was the original managers making you feel like they really wanted to help. They didnt care if you joke a little. They wanted to make sure that you had fun while working."
good,"Great company to work for I enjoyed store operation, staffing, training."
good,"typical day: rushing to complete our current delivery truck"
good,This is a great place to work if your in school or not ready to get a full time job. employees are great.
good,"customer service"
good,"- A typical day at work for me would be bringing great joy to ALL of our customers. Going above and beyond to make sure that we meet their needs and requirements."
good,loved my job and the people I worked with and the community. There was nothing really hard about the job. Sometimes it would get very busy but it was all a part of the job. The most enjoyable part was that everyone there and the people that shopped there was like seeing old family and friends again.
good,"Lead Sales Manager. Responsibilities include vendor check in/out, inventory control, and making and counting deposits. Also supervising a team of 4-6 associates in completing scheduled takes. Customer service. Maintaining general cleanliness of store also."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Dollar General , Managment was great and staff  / Co workers were exellent & friendly."
good,a productive and enjoyable place to work until new management took over.  Enjoyed my customers and fellow coworkers
good,A typical day at work consisted of customer service stocking inventory making sure store was presentable at at all times running cash register as needed. I learned the value of attention to detail. Manangement was ok being I had the same management at another job prior. I enjoyed my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was nothing. The most enjoyable part of my job I can't really say but I did enjoy the customers.
good,"Great employees and customers. Always having  fun, sucked working holidays"
good,"open store, put out merchandise, set plannagrams, hire, do schedules, customer service, coaching employee."
good,I would recommend Dollar General to anyone that is working to advance in the workplace.
good,"A typical day for a manager is about 10 hours doing everything needed to take care of your customers.  The hardest part of the job is when you are short staffed.  The most enjoyable is when everyone is working as a team.  That's when your store looks great, the customers and employees are happy."
good,"A typical day working at the Dollar General is never the same.  I would run a cash register and check customer's product's out for them bag the customer's product's.  Then some day's I would run Truck, and what i mean by running truck is restocking the shelves and making sure that the product's were in their proper place's through out the store. I loved working with my co-worker's we would have contest's to see who could put the stock up fastest and correctly.  The most enjoyable part about the job was working with the public"
good,"I would go in and clock in, I would then count in my drawer, I was a key holder which is a manager on duty when the manager is not there. I would work on cleaning the store and giving the other associates breaks while handling the returns and cash register. The manager was pretty cool, she would try to help as much as she could. My coworkers were fantastic we were like a family always trying to better each other. There really wasn't a hard part to my job and I enjoyed every single part of it, even the mopping and sweeping."
good,"from dollar general to dollar market I went from cashier to key-holder to assistant manager.open/close of store,counting tills.closing and opening of registers.payroll,ordering,counts,stock and truck unloading.co-workers were great.down fall of job were managers quitting or being transfer.the most enjoyable days were when we had a good day or after inventory we received a bonus."
good,"Good bunch of people, however scheduling is very difficult"
good,"I typically unload the trucks, stock the shelves, straighten the shelves. Customer service, customer carryouts."
good,"typically I run the register "
good,You do have to work hard however to maintain stores. You are only allowed so much payroll according to sales which the sales are always good but the manager has to not be lazy but to stay on top of the merchandising.
good,A typical day at work would be fun I waas working with mostly guys. Most of my co workers were easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part of the job was working.
good,"I loved working there. Great compay! I stared when i was 5 months pregnant and left when i was 9 months, 1 week before the baby was due. They were very understanding and gsve me great hours and also worded with my needs as far as breaks."
good,Helping customer check in rooms. Sales or reservations i enjoy meeting new.
good,"Most of the time spent at work was fast paced.Not alot of time for idle chit chat.Most of our customers were nice garden variety kind of people.Most of them were fun to be around.I did enjoy being around my co-workers.Most were good people.I'm usually the one you come to when you have a problem or question at work or personal.Working in customer service related jobs all my life has taught me to handle each person or situation individually as needed. Having a military background has tought me to show leadership, but show compassion when needed."
good,"Executed daily operations of managing cash sales, stocking shelves, cleaning store."
good,It was one of the best jobs I ever have had I enjoyed the constant work Loved the employees and the customers Time flew by when I was at work because I was busy doing something at all times Learning how 2 be a Assistance Manager
good,I enjoyed working at the dollar general...There was a lot of things that I really Liked such as Most of the people that I worked with the jobs that actually had to be done such as planograms. I love customers even the ones that have had a bad day those are usually the ones that I went out of my way with to be really nice to. I always had a smile even when I was in a bad mood.. The hardest part was when my manager was gone all the time because It felt as thought everyone else wanted to be the boss and They had that chip on their shoulder...
good,A very busy workplace. I manage 7 employees and deligate my tasks to comply with the companies store operations.
good,"a typical day at work included me stocking shelves, and doing my daily cashier routine, i learned money handling skills, and stocking skills, management was easy going, my co workers were friendly and down to earth, the hardest part of my job, was being in the store the day it got robbed, the most enjoyable part was the whole experience"
good,"The typical day at work I would count the money in the register help customers with shopping and issues with store prices, stock the shelves with products, monitor suspicous looking customers, and counting the draw down at the end of a shift. I learned how to be part of a small team and be flexable when people call in. The management is like part of the employees and works in the same areas as the employees under them. Most of the co-workers are excellent hard workers with one or two that do not pull their weight. Working with the one or two employees not doing their job was a struggle but I found ways to still be productive. The hardest part of my job was looking at some tasks asked to do and knowing that it would take longer than a shift and having to leave before I was finished with the project. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping older people gather the items on their list and help them put their bags in their cars, and seeing the sincere thankfullness these people had for my help."
good,I enjoyed working for the dollar general I would like to get a job working at the one in Georgia where I had to move.
good,It was a good working environment. I enjoyed working and greeting people.
good,If I opened the store I would gather information and reports from the previous day and make sure the cash registers had the correct amount of money. I would make sure the store was ready for shoppers use. I learned at this job how to manage employees and pay attention to their needs. I also learned how to deal with irrate customers and thieves. The management was great because they made everyone feel as though they mattered. The co-workers was great because everyone knew what was expected of them. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with theives. The most enjoyable part was meeting and helping people.
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to work with such warm and friendly people. The time I spent working there I had such a wonderful learning experience getting to know my customers and the committment I made to give them the best possible customer service I could provide with a smile.
good,"provides customer service and operates the cash register. Customer service duties include greeting guests, directing guests to products, and providing product knowledge. When running the cash register, a Dollar General cashier scans items, processes payments, provides change, and bags items."
good,"This was easily my favorite job, good co-works, great management, easy work life and great customers. the only reason why i left was to seek higher paying work"
good,A mi me gusta trabajar para los clientes  y mis compañeros Me ayudan y los ayudo yo
good,"Easy to climb the ladder if you really apply yourself. If you have no intentions of advancing yourself within the company i would steer clear, the base pay isn't worth it tbh."
good,"It got me out of my comfort zone for the better. I enjoyed working there very much, my associates were amazing. I feel like I became a better person working there."
good,I feel as though Dollar general showed me how to be a stand up employee and what it is to have excellent customer service. I've learned many things since I've started all the way until now as a key carrier
good,A typical day was clocking in county my drawer and then going back pulling rolltainers out and stocking the shelves and helping the customers as much as I could
good,"This was my first retail job and I absolutely loved it. Working with customers/public was fun. I learned to be a leader, and was given a promotion of assistant manager. My favorite part of the job was running the cashier, working directly with the customers."
good,it is great place to work  for . the  people are very nice  to work with  its not a very hard job and its a decent atmosphere  i have fun working  their
good,Good work place kinda hectic during the holidays very easy and flexible with hours but not guaranteed 40+ a week very friendly and good work environment
good,"I learned being an assistant can be hard work and sometimes you need to work alone cuz of not having enough help, also not enough training to learn everything.. They had benefits but manager didn't take time to help apply or to explain my options."
good,I love everything'about it it was a very big learning experience for me and I have grown because of it it is worthwhile to get a job with this company
good,Ran cashier and cleaned up front  and stocked up goods the whole night. On a typical closing shift I always vacummed and or swept then counted my drawer
good,It was professional busy and everyone worked sufficiently and by the book. Personally i enjoyed working there because the people were nice the workers were always motivated and it was just a good place to work
good,Decent but have to be great w/ customer service and stressful work environment. Overall is decent place if the management is fair and not underhanded.
good,My managers were accommodating and aware of all our backgrounds. I learned how to stay aware of the customers and how to help them if needed. They trained me on how to work the P.O.S systems and close each night. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who were rude or passing unwanted advances.
good,Maternity leave and never went back! Need a job asap love to work!  Manage manage store employees and open and close store  clean bathroom organizations the store
good,It was a great place to work for and was nice to meet the people I got to work with management was fair and could be your boss and ur friend at the same time only bad thing was benefits
good,Fast paced and crazy at times. Co-workers are really nice and help answer any questions that you have. The manager is pretty flexible from what i remember
good,"I learned how to communicate with coworkers to make work easier and how to communicate with costumers if I ran into any problems. "
good,Everyone was so nice to work with  loved working there. My manager was very nice. Good schedule. Loved seeing familiar faces everyday. Would highly recommend
good,"Things ran much smoother once our Manager was replaced. We worked as a team and always helped each other out when needed. We worked at keeping the store clean, free of clutter, shelves being presentable and easy for customers to reach items. We were constantly getting compliments on how clean and well stocked our store was from travelers. This helped keep us motivated and proud of our store."
good,"Working here for the last 5 years has been a great experience, looking to expand my experience. I loved learning everything new and being involved with a group."
good,"It was a decent starting off pay. They offered flexible shifts. Good management. I didn’t get too much hours , as I was part time.. that was the only thing I can complain about. Overall a good job."
good,When I worked at Dollar General I was fresh out of High School and didn't know what to expect. But honestly i was the easiest job I've ever had. If i were to get paid more I wouldn't have left.
good,"One of the better companies to work for in the area. Good schedule, benefits, decent pay, steady work. Its hard work but keeps you in good shape. Management treats you well too."
good,"Turnover rate with DM’s way to high, lack of communication with corporate. Time management, and not enough labor hours. Good plan as far as the 7 day work flow."
good,The day is usually busy. Coworkers and management work together to provide quality customer service in an efficient manner. The pace is upbeat. Personal communication skills are useful.
good,"I loved working at dollar general. It was a secondary job for me, and I was able to go to it once I got off at my first job. I loved the fast pace and the work."
good,"My manager was absolutely amazing and extremely kind and my coworkers were all friendly and would talk to me and try to get to know me. I only left here because I had a different job opportunity available with better pay that I needed. Nothing crazy ever happened with customers, people usually just grab what they need and go on their way but it could get frustrating at how limited employees are on the registers."
good,"My days at work there was very long, but enjoyed them.  Time would fly by when we stayed busy."
good,It's ok place to work for just a lot is expected of you. You have all of your tasks given online. You have a lot of training to do that you don't get paid for. Kinda sucks.
good,"Great working environment, A lot of opportunity to advance and learn many new skills, full time hours provided as well as overtime if needed and flexible shifts"
good,"Have a good team and you will be fantastic at DG.   There is always a lot of work to do so you should have planning and time management experience.  Unfortunately, they hire more externally than internal.   I have personally struggled with turnover in Regional position in order to get any advancement.   But that doesn’t make me love DG any less."
good,Their rules are very strict and the system takes you out of the system after 30 days without work.It was an awkward environment. There was not enough people to work at night.
good,I’ve learned a lot about dealing with money and being over someone. I love the workplace culture because of my customers they keep me going . The hardest part of my job is working rolltainers that have have to be done in a certain amount of days . The most enjoyable part of my job is working with different people and also meeting all different kinds of people.
good,I love the company but the store I work at is rough.  It makes going to work very taxing . Local police don't assist leaving you vulnerable to anything
good,It was a very nice safe work place people were easy to get  along withvery fast work invoilerment  really clean  employers were so nice always treated with respect
good,"Come in at the time you are scheduled to come in. Look over things such as see if the schedule changes, what is written down that we have to do etc. Clock in at the time you are supposed to then start your day/night if you work night shift."
good,enjoy the customers and working with the other employees and i liked the weekly pay and i enjoyed the job we was just always needing more help than we had
good,Dollar General Was My First Job That I Had Until I Started Working There. It Was A Great Job They Just Wasn’t Paying Me Enough And I Have a Child And Trying To Get Stable. Overall Dollar General Was A Great Job But They Didn’t Give Me Enough Hrs Or The Pay Wasn’t Enough
good,"I loved working there. Customers were awesome, management needed some work though. Love stocking shelfs and working register  Loved interacting with the customers"
good,"Management was out for themselves, coworkers became family so we stuck together. Was there for a paycheck and not for employees. Stock room was always a mess and the displays were late."
good,The way the company is run is efficient and creates an environment most people wouldn't mind working in. Typically the teams in this specific location get along very well.
good,"You’ll work with good coworkers and a generous manager. It’s slower paced. Regulars are very common so a bond with them will most likely happen, which is good for reviews."
good,It was the first time working as a shelf stocker and you get trained fast and it is easy but fast paced job and you work with others as a team member.
good,"enjoyed the job, my store manager is a wonderful person.my co workers are all nice people, we all get along well . The  work environment  is steady and the customers are the best part of my day. a nice store to work in."
good,I enjoy working there even though we really have a problem with theft and also. Customers moving products where they Don't belong and you have to keep moving them back all day long takes out of what your expected to get done for you shift staff works together well would recommend dollar general  if you are. Looking for a job
good,I went to work every day excited about my job. More fun than I had ever had before at work. I would recommend it to anyone. Would love to one day feel that way again
good,"Working for Dollar General was an experience as an manager and having all control of the store with stocking shelves and greeting customers, and checking vendors into the store. Which I love learning knew things and having an challenge. All my customers liked me very well and they always come back to the store. Its always how you treat people and give good service to your customers, that's a great deal of to company."
good,When I obtained the job I was in the middle of a crew change and the store was a bit run down but with in the few months that I was employed there we (all of the employees) that hired into the place did work together until advancements were on the table.
good,I miss dollar general. Your store is your business and its up to you if it fails or not. The headache for me was putting the sales out. I would grind my teeth everytime. But in all seriousness its a great place to learn and to grow.
good,Dollar General was a good company to be with.  The management was good to work for.  The amount of hours given to the employees was adequate.  The customers were fun to work with.  And the amount of work given to the employees was good.
good,Out of all my jobs i have had dollar general has been my favorite i really enjoyed doing a key holders job i learned alot of different things at dollar general.
good,"Working here showed me a lot about myself and people. Customer service can be challenging sometimes. There are only two registers and the lines get long fast. The hardest part of that is that there is usually no help, because the other cashiers or sale associates are working the floor, that gets hectic sometimes. Favoritism is a ""thing"" in establishments, but it was an okay place to work."
good,"It's very stressful, no time for family and friends. Work 60-70 hours a week only 1 day off and no holidays off except for Christmas. It's sucking the life out of me, and I'm exhausted and worn out."
good,"May want to look into their upper management. Seems that once you have made a friend you can go up, up, up. Job performance and going the extra mile doesn't seem to matter."
good,"Proficient in modern digital cash register/scanner/credit pinpad"
good,"Working at dollar general was a very great experience for me , I got too meet a lot of new people also learn lots of new things the co workers are very friendly and always willing to help you along the way , they welcome you with smiles and treat you like family"
good,"They need to give a people a chance. I was fired because I took a fake $100.00 . At the time i was the only person on a register and had people that were getting mad because it was taking so long. I took the money and marked it with the pen. It was fine. Moved on to the next person. I think I would still be working there if I had some help and had the other register running. Just like that, they put me out. They didnt even let me pay it so I could stay. All the work I put in and It means nothing. Im still going to give kind words for the store because they did give me a job so I could make it for my kids. Just hope they dont cut anyone without a chance after this point because you dont know whats going on in their lives."
good,It was a fun experience in a smaller retail store with fun employees because everyone knew each other and were awesome to each other making it a good workplace.
good,It was a good company the turn over is high tho and I was a manager so i worked allot of hours bc I was salary . I left dollar general to go to a big box store .
good,I'm great with people relations while on the job. The employees and the store manager are great people to work for. Very understanding company. Just need to have more hours of work time.
good,"It's a great job, and my coworkers are great, but the management is the problem currently. My hours were cut dramatically, which is definitely a problem unfortunately."
good,"Loved my management and my co-workers didn't know much about benefits, I think that the management above my managers were terrible but you don't have much contact with them so it doesn't really matter"
good,"Relaxed management, easy to work with coworkers, slow paced and easy, little on the job training, lots of computer training, customers easy to deal with."
good,Love working here. They are friendly and there is job security. Drug free company..you will have a job as long as you work hard. You can advance as long as you meet requirements
good,Very fun and interactive place. But very busy. Dollar General opened up my eyes to see different career options and that I like the daily office tasks needed to keep the store running. The hardest part of the job was to not give into temptation and buy a bunch of stuff.
good,I like my job at the dollar general because I can be at customer service and can work with people. I like ringing people out and I like being able to help stock shelves because it helps me find where things are in the store.
good,I learn a lot from Dollar General how to deal with customer how to run the store alone it was a great experience and I really enjoyed it . I also enjoy workers
good,I felt there wasn't a future for me at dollar general. there were no benefits. the co-workers were normally young and had no desire to improve the store look etc..
good,I think if your gonna hire someone with customer service experience and business operation experience at least pay them what they are worth especially if they are hard working do not pay them8.50 an hour at least pay them 13.00 if they have more than 5 years experience and pay managers 20.00 an hour for all the carp they put up with on top financial tracking of your working for a million dollar business and your experiences demand more for yourself when you fill out the application.
good,It’s a good company. I enjoyed working for the company. I worked there while I went to school. I quit to join the military. The management in Pecos is ok. There was a lot of things that people did that I didn’t like.
good,I learned how to work hard and to push myself to do better. The hardest part of the job is putting away the truck on weekends. I loved spending time with my co-workers and seeing the regular customers.
good,"Handling money correctly, assisting customers to make sure their satisfied with everything they purchase and also making sure work area is cleaned at all times."
good,It was an easy but fun job. I worked the register but also stocked shelves. I learned how to tell where to put things on the shelves by the box. The hardest part of the job would be working the register WHILE also stocking shelves.
good,"Extremely easy job, good customers good co-workers, manager is flexible and goes off any schedule you have. Manager cares about you and your mental health."
good,"Start at the cash register. When there was no customers, I would go stock the shelves up front that needed to be done. When a customer would be waiting at register, I would stop what I was doing and go help that customer. At this job, I learned that is a fast paced job which you would have to be quick and good at multitasking."
good,"A tropical day at daycare only when we didn't have a lot of customers and the line wasn't down the aisle."
good,Great place to work if you are a team player and like results. Pay is very good as are the benefits. Highly recommend anyone to work for Dollar General.
good,Great place to work. Coworkers are very friendly and make working a better experience. Customers are kind and understanding. You do get called in a lot though bc others don't want to work their job.
good,"DG is a good company to work for.  They do provide employees with advancement with in, with little to no management experience.  Overall it is a good company."
good,Good starter job. If you have all the time in the world you can advance your career quickly. They do expect alot out of you and will challenge you daily.
good,Really enjoyed this job and how fast paced it was. I had a great manager and had some great customers. Of course not all customers are good and my manager usually backed me up.
good,"I enjoyed working here as I learned a lot more about the retail business than in prior years.  "
good,"This was my first job, and I appreciate them taking a chance on me and giving me a job. I learned how retail is set up because I had to run the register, stock the floor and help customers."
good,"Very nice place to work, and the people are nice. I felt that they were generous when I couldn't work certain hours and they were flexible with my practicum and school schedule."
good,A usual day is you clock in and do stretches and they give you how much work we have to do and then we get to it. I learned the best way to get into different positions is to want to learn. The management was off at first being a new dc but got better as we and they learned how to run a warehouse better as most were all new hires as well as us. The workplace is fast but fun because you compete who can get the best percentage and the end of the night.The hardest part about the job would be trying to show your worth since theres so many people that work there. The most enjoyable part of my job is the group of people you meet at the warehouse.
good,"a very good day i never had a bad day"
good,"my managers were awesome and made my experience here very awesome. you meet awesome people and working together can be great! if your store isn't making much, reduction in  hours may occur which is never good. Cutomers as always are the biggest pain out of the whole job, and facing products on shelves. oyu van literally get fired for it!"
good,There wasn’t any drama. No gossip.  Great work crew. The manager was great with scheduling. We always stayed busy. No laziness was allowed. Everyone did the job right so that meant no double working
good,Love the company and the leadership. Hard for a work life balance.  Hardest part of the job is the hiring process and promoting from a SM to a DM. Need more pay raises
good,Easy job could use better pay in beginning. You love your customers that's what make your day. Quick piace job only on ship men days. Your coworkers become family.
good,Be ready to put in the work. Also be ready to advance and get paid for your work. You get back out of Dollar General what you put into it. I had a passion for this job.
good,"You had to be fast paced and have a certain amount done , but the managers were great, Very understanding people. Learned alot about retail, and worked with a variety of people."
good,Very ongoing job not a lot of time for family or a hobby life! The schedule for store managers like all store managers are 6 days a week but the work load is very large
good,Dollar General is a fun place with many different jobs to do it is Fast Pace and well-rounded store all in all. Everyone is very nice and helpful. The store is very well organized.
good,Overall good company.  The DM needed to communicate better with the store manager and other key holders.  Time off was given when needed. Understood the balance needed between work and family.
good,"A typical day at work was balanced, consistent, and welcome. I learned something new about working with new kinds of people every day and learning to make a steady balance of work, multi-tasking, and taking on new tasks every day."
good,"The employees were what really made the time there great, we all got a long really well. The only thing that was a downer were some of the customers. We had shoplifters and other patrons that were violent or otherwise unpleasant, though the majority of them were very delightful. A lot of them were regulars that knew us by name and it was always nice to catch up with them."
good,"Oversee the day to day operations, worked with my team, and reviewed OT, wages, communicated with team, dealt with urgent issues, worked with my store to have a positive foot print within the community and Customer Service."
good,I liked working at dollar general because the manger was amazing person she was very fair and tried helping with anything she could she also let me get more hours by going to a couple different stores and still working at the one I was originally hired into. she also helped me work around my kids shedules
good,Had exciting work being around more individuals than I ever had. My typical day was average and working 3 to 4 days.Management was on point.It wasn't nothing I couldn't handle!
good,"All in all, Dollar General was a great place to work for.  They could use more communication within the management.  Each day is different, but always a steady pace of work.  The workplace would depend upon the employees that were there and depending on their personality at the time, but mostly, was always good.  Hardest part of the job was finding people to fill in for employees that didn't come or show up to work.  The enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I had finished all my daily tasks plus some."
good,Days at work were usually fun and yet hard at work. I learned a lot about team work and how to handle cash and help run a successful store. Management was excellent and friendly. The hardest part of the job was nothing! Great place to work.
good,It was a blast to work at the dollar general as all the employees got along great with each other and the customers were such a joy to see every time they entered the store. Although the store changed managers numerous times during my employment I didn't have a problem with the management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the occasional unruly customer. The most enjoyable part was when I was advanced to Key holder and the more freedom that provided to me instead of standing behind a register every day.
good,I loved working for dollar general but the hours worked by a manager did not fit the pay. It also kept you away from your family and children a lot there was not a good balance.
good,"Help customers while stocking shelves and cleaning up store . At the "
good,"I would recommend Dollar General as a part-time job for someone. Although you have to be flexible, if you are a hard worker and placed with a good manager you will be able to work this job and still maintain everyday life in a stress free environment."
good,"I just wasnt getting enough hours to support my family, the employee was amazing and helpful and even manager was good. I would have enjoyed if I had more hours"
good,A typical day is I am main register.  I usually will have over 50-250 customers depending what day it is.  Thursday through Sunday are the most busiest.  I have learned how to check vendor products in on our handheld computers.  Having to talk face to face with customers and customers that might have a complaint.  The hardest part of job is standing for sometimes 7 hours on my feet without sitting.  The most enjoyable is all of my team mates and boss we all work together.  We have a great team.
good,"It was a good first job, I started out a little over minimum wage and part time but quickly became full time, I became a key holder within a year so there is plenty of room for advanment"
good,Great if you ever want to learn how to run your own store.  Generally the employees are cool and your managers make you feel like home as long as you finish your tasks there really aren't many issues as you would think working customer service.
good,my day was opening and closing making sure that the store was stock and running the front of the store the hardest part was when the customer was making things difficult and you have to stand your ground.
good,Dollar General was a great place for advancement in retail. It was also good for networking with other individuals in the workplace. Very informative and enlightening with all the meetings and trips I got to take. I've learned a lot of skills that I can carry on from working with dollar general and apply it to my everyday life.
good,On a normal day at work it is usually pretty busy.  It's usually 3-4 people there including a manager.  Everyone worms together wither at the register or on the floor stocking and organizing the store. Everyone takes turns on register. If one need help a manager or another employee would be there as son as possible with no attitude. Regular customers come in and love everyone even new employees. Great environment despite the fact people stole almost every day.
good,If you don't like working hard and long hours this job ain't for you.... Over all this cpompany is great to work for.. Never had any problems with anyone
good,Love working and that type of environment it was a fun and very active place to keep your line of communication open with customers customer service is definitely a key at this facility
good,Dollar General provides a decent working experience.  Customer service is important.  They also focused on trying to keep the store stocked and clean.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar General. I would go back."
good,"Handled cash, sales, stocked shelves, finalized payroll and bank deposits. Greeted customers and had excellent customer service. Made schedules and checked truck in."
good,"Dollar General was my first job, they paid minimum wage, but hours were good, and very flexible. I was pretty much able to work the shift I preferred. My manager was amazing, and since I worked in a small town, all the customers were fun as well. I ran the register, stocked and zoned the floor, and cleaned the occasional mess as well as directing customers to items they were searching for."
good,"Do freight set up plant grams do end caps as well. "
good,Overall I had a good time at this job besides the fact I was improperly trained and fired for it but I didn't stress it too much since it was my first job and a lot of the error probably was on my side.
good,"I think all places should consider all of the evidence before they make choices .I was let go from the company due to 2 checks that came up missing from out of  my drawer. I contacted corporate office and the S.T.A.R.S team. The stars team came in and recovered the checks that were placed in the drawer and they offered me my position back, however I had already found another job."
good,nice place to work only if you dont need benefits. they are for full timers only. two much work for two people on nights should be three people. not enough pay for all the work you have to do for the company and where i worked the manger never worked weekends which i thought was unfair.
good,Dollar General was my first actual job. I loved my store manager and co-workers. The customers were great. This particular store was the top store in the county and district. I really miss working there.
good,"very fast paced employment, stocking, cleaning, running cash register is your job title! you get to meet a lot of ppl and give them a big smile and make someones day is the pro's of this job"
good,"its a"
good,Dollar general was a good place to work for I wish I didn't have to relocate or I would still be with them. The manager was very nice and was all about the donations for the kids in need.
good,working with some good people and the customers were fun also.  The manager was very active in the store as well.. The atmosphere was fast paced and you always had something to do or clean
good,"This would be my first part time job I just want to get responsible if you need a work permit I will get one , anything is possible to me I am very hard working"
good,The work environment was laid back. The managers are nice but strict. The company is able to work around any schedule. The only thing that's stressful is stocking shelves.
good,this job gave me a good experience working with the public and meeting new people everyday. I also learned alot when it comes to time as well as patience. Great summer job .
good,great job to work at and also mark was a great manager. some staff weren't the best but defiantly a place I would want to work at again if I got the opportunity.
good,The company is nice but I feel that they need  more staff and hours to handle the work load. Dollar General is a nice place to work at it. The staff is friendly
good,Great place to work fun respectful out going easy work great customer service with all empolyees and managers just needed more hours not enough hours during my working week
good,Great company supplied me with any opportunity to be employed. Management was very nice and worked hand in hand with me to achieve company goals. Position was only temporary as store was relocating to another facility. Would love to be re-hired.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar General  The only problem I had was completing the required computer tests in a timely manner.  This was not my fault.  I was told the computer had not been replaced since 1988 and I had great difficulty with it; it constantly locked up, would not save data that I had submitted and then I had to resubmit it, would not allow me to sign in after myself and the Asst. Manager  came to assist me - it required five attempts before signing me in.  I also had trouble  They also have outdated registers.  I repeatedly had to hit one of the keys five times and it kept sticking.  I required the Manager to assist me."
good,This is a good company to work for. Easy to move up. The pay is not very good with the amount of money this company brings in. The company could start you at a decent pay.
good,"I loved working at the dollar general, mainly because of my customers, my regulars I walked in every day knowing I would see those happy faces atleast once that evening. I was key holder so I dissolved most issues and they always left happy and coming back because of the respect I showed them through their issue I had many minor issues with a product not working correctly and me giving them respect and fixing their issue that have said they only come in when I was there. It makes a job so much more when you have that kind of connection with people."
good,Fine place to work if you can adjust you schedule to fit theirs.  Part time ended up being 39 hours a week. To me thats not part time. And at 8:00 a hour it is'nt worth it.
good,There was never a dull moment or time when there was not several things that needed to be done.  But i enjoyed the job and loved my customers.  Wish I still had that job.
good,I really enjoyed working with Dollar General for the short time I was employed there. The manager and a few of the co-workers were very nice. I also learned how to operate a cash register during my time the there.
good,Dollar general is a great place to work at I highly recommend working here the people that works here are really nice no problems with the customers and great working environment
good,I really enjoyed helping out customers when they were ready to check out. I enjoyed putting stock away and doing the stock truck when it came in. I would put stock away very fast and make sure trash out of the backroom was taken out.
good,This was a good job for people that need a way to move up in the food chain quickly. There hardly any hard work to do this job its very easy and reliable
good,"I liked my job,it was fun and busy, I enjoyed working with the customers an the people I worked with. Never s dull moment. I really enjoyed my job an interacting with people"
good,"Managed my shifts properly, ensuring shelves were stocked and itmes were in their place, worked as cashier when needed, engaed with customers with a friendly manner, and worked as a team with other managers and employees to keep the store clean and stocked."
good,"Great place to work, good place to get work experience in sales. Room for advancement. Overall, great place to work. Benefits available, availability for hours was limited but that was really the only con."
good,"cashed out customers, stocked inventory, faced shelves, done product facing, very fast paced, did recover alot of items that were stolen swept the floors and counted the drawer down at end of shift"
good,I quickly advanced. The job requirments are few. The cash register is not difficult to learn. The training was also a short time frame.  Overall the slow passed environment was enjoyable
good,Job wasnt fair at all the pay was terrible and rhe mangers were never on time and they sucked with the pay every week no one  should work for just 8.25 a wwwk
good,It's a fun place to work. When you don't have a lot going on in your life. It's something do to pass the time and easy to move up. Sometimes a lot of responsibility which isn't hard to do. But I enjoy working here.
good,I had a great time working there. All of my work did get done unless we got really busy. I loved my hours I worked. I have worked 55 hours before. Got called in all the time which was ok
good,"i loved working here,it would have been better if the pay was a little better,the manager was a great person to work for,i would go back to work for her again"
good,I had fun working there and I felt like they needed more help and management training. The store I worked at was the worst looking out of the other locations.
good,"This job was a great learning experience for customer service, stock and cashiering. As for a typical day of work I would either be stocking shelves or handling the cash register. Normally I would be put on the cash register as the only cashier on days of massive influx in order to get up with the flow of traffic. My experiences with the management was a positive experience with the management never giving me more than i could handle and pushing me to get even better and supported my decision to go to college."
good,"Not a dream job but it was still a good one even though they didn't want to pay us full time pay when we were severely understaffed, but I would work there again."
good,"A typical day at Dollar General consisted of stocking, cleaning, running register and management duties. I learned all the typical retail experiences needed for retail jobs. My co-workers were dedicated members to Dollar General who were easy to establish relationships with. The hardest part of the job was when problems happened with money shortages and overages, but with my excellent problem solving skills everything was concluded. The most enjoyable part of the job was working flexible hours with great customers and co-workers."
good,It was great to work for them. I enjoyed working with the public and people. It was never slow always busy I enjoyed working and doing set out and plan o grams
good,"I've been with Dollar General for going on 2 year's now, it's been a thrilling ride and it still is. I've learned so much towards this business, I can now feel more confident and relaxed in interviews of jobs in need of Assistant Manager's or Managers.A good place to work from my perspective."
good,Great place to work only thing I didn't like is our District Manager changed at least once every couple of months. Easy job as long as you don't mind being on your feet.
good,"sometimes you will feel overworked and somethimes the days are dragging by because of boredom, hence the life of retail, minimum wage, 20 hours or less or if they need you it may be 30+"
good,great job and loved meeting so many people. Alot to do with counting money and the store sales. y workers enjoy coming to work because the environment was very nice.
good,Not a bad job if your looking for very steady and consistent work thats not too complicated. The people are nice and friendly depending on location and you can expect dollar general to not close while your working there only get better.
good,weekly pay and decent pay rate. customers are friendly. management supported staff. flexable work hours. clean work place. friendly coworkers. easy to meet people
good,I liked this job because the manager was very helpful and understanding.  Everyone tried to help each other whether it was buying lunch for a co worker who didn't have to money.  I learned that teamwork makes the dream work
good,Co workers and management with great people skills made you feel like family. Everyone helped everyone to accomplish getting stock out of the back room and on the floor.
good,"stocking shelves , doing truck , making sure the product was available for customers , handling cash deposits ,counting drawers,cleaning the store ,doing schedules"
good,it was a great job over all but advancement and raises were tough to come buy. i was a part time employee that was working overtime too often and still never got a raise in the almost year i was there. just gotta have a lot of patience.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of unloading trucks, following company work procedures to receive, open and unpack cartons, totes, and store merchandise in the stock room or move them directly to sales floor. We would also operate cash registers and flatbed scanners to itemize and total customer's purchases. I learned how much I love stocking and seeing the different people each day. The management team had a really poor work ethic and seemed like they didn't like their job or the positions they were was in. My co-workers were helpful. I would say the hardest part was learning how to display and learning the whole store but once you get the hang of things, anything is possible. The most enjoyable aspect of my job was the overall experience. I love every job because it teaches you different skill sets that you can apply to at other jobs or in life."
good,"I think that Dollar General was a good job beside the fact that the pay was horrible and the hours are limited, The management was good, and co-workers respected each other."
good,"Great company to work for for, but it was hard to advance into management. Stocking was enjoyable, because you could check out the nice merchandise."
good,"You have your regulars that come in and just make it a great environment."
good,"It was a pleasure to work for Dollar General. I am a very people friendly person so I loved running registar. I got along well with my fellow workers and Management as well. I not only worked register but stocked murhandise, maintained store apperenciece as well."
good,A typical day at work here is stocking and cleaning the shelves and dealing with the customers. I really enjoyed my job here it was easy and most of the people who came through where kind. They worked with you if you needed time off and it helped me learn to speak confidently to customers. The hardest part of this job was stocking shelves and watching the register to make sure there werent customers waiting to be checked out. the only reason i left this job is because they cut my hours. I just wasnt making enough to pay my bills so I had to find another job.
good,In the position I held at Dollar General I learned what quality customer service consisted of and was happy to apply it on my daily shifts.
good,"I was in charge of the register and also stocking."
good,"I worked at the Dollar General Store on Center St. in Cedar Falls, IA. I was very comfortable and at ease because the facility was well organized and clean. My co workers were very friendly and the atmosphere was professional yet warm and welcoming"
good,A typical day at work is hard work.  I really enjoy all the work tha I do at and for this company the co-workers are nice we all get along and come together to get our work done.  The hardest part of the job I think is the rude customers.  But the most enjoyable part is making the customers happy.
good,"A typical day at work would be me coming exchanging greetings with the team and getting right into work. Asking for help when needed and also returning the favor if asked. My co-workers were great and worked very hard. The hardest part was losing a team member, but we always welcomed any new comers. My most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself. I love to work."
good,"customer service, staying busy, stocking shelves, and checking out customers. never have time to be bored always something to do. management was decent to work with but very unappreciated. only critizied and never let you know when you ever did anything good. for the most part there was great team work. hardest part of the job was cupon cutters and holding the line up. best part was helping customers find things and keeping the store clened."
good,"I loved working here at dollar general. It's a job of having to adapt to different management, sometimes different locations, and different tasks on a daily basis depending on the flow of business."
good,A typical day was to clock in and get money to count to make sure it was $150.00. Then I would go to work. I would either do totes or do recovery in between customers. In less a girl came in before me then she is the one running the front and i would be doing the closing recovery and/or totes. I learned to read labels right to put out all the stuff. All the manager's was nice and would always there to help. My co-workers was awesome love them. The hardest part of the job is to get things out faster and to have to do two things at a time. The most enjoyable thing about the job is seeing the normal customers or helping people when they need it.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General consist of busy and slow, depend on the time of day. Its always work to be done even on a slow day."
good,I loved working for Dollar General. I loved working with my coworkers. The hardest part of my job was not getting enough hours.

THe hardest part of my job is not getting enough hours.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being close to home and gaining the experience and knowledge the I have in the 2 years of being there."
good,Working at dollar general it is a wonderful environment meeting different customers and assisting customers stocking and making sure the store is clean for the next day.I enjoy working in this environment
good,It was fun as long as there was a truthful manager who obeyed the rules and did not treat others differently.
good,"My experience was always an enjoyable one.  setting pog, working close with customer"
good,I Enjoyed This Job Because I Stayed Busy & Very Productive Stocking & Counting Plenty Inventory.
good,"Had to deal with about 300 to 400 costumers, Also i had to make sure the costumers found everything they needed. Also, I Had to help the costumer lift and bring the bags to the car if needed."
good,"I was only employed with Jody Zimmer at Dollar General for just under 2 months when I found out I was in a high risk pregnancy, then I started having problems with medical and had to relocate for better care."
good,A typical day at Dollar General if in a well populated location is non-stop there are constantly people coming in and there are not enough hours in the day to run cashier and stock the amount of totes the district manager demands of you to stock in a certain amount of time  and attend to customer needs also. When I worked there we had the best crew of workers we all worked well together never argued we helped one another and that makes success in a work environment. I enjoyed communicating with the customers as many of them I knew being we are a small community. The hardest part of the job to me was worrying we wouldn't do something right like for instance put something in the wrong spot or not stock as many totes in a day we should have and on truck days I dreaded going in because the store is a mess and the customers complain of not being able to get through the isles. I think Dollar General needs to hire a night shift to stock during the night so the customers don't have to deal with rolltainers in the isles while they are trying to shop. Over all my experience of 7 months at Dollar General was a great experience!
good,I had the misfortune to work for a young manager that never worked weekends.  He had to consideration for any other associates scheduling requirements even occasional occurrences.
good,"Hard steady days"
good,"Company pays decent for retail management, however employees are very expendable.  You will not feel like this place has your back through low times in life."
good,I was the last cashier hired under this manager and the first to be let go so the hours could be covered by other cashiers.
good,"I had a wonderful manager while working at Dollar General. He was very understanding and made the job so a joy to be at. I was responsible for working at the cash register, stocking the shelves, daily counting of tobacco products, and greeting customers in a friendly manner.."
good,I liked my job at dollar general and that is why I want to go back I was learning a lot while working there
good,its a great place to learn about customer service patience with the customers and how to communicate with them as well. I absolutly learned how to be very patient with the customers and how to communicate as well. the most part that i enjoyed about that job was when i was able to help a customer out with any questions they had or any situation.
good,Pretty nice working conditions. Rather long hours though. Have to work generally every weekend.
good,my typical work day begins at 8:00 am its usually slow between 8 and 10 so I just be cleaning and stocking shelves around 10:15 it starts to pick up. at 12:00 I take a lunch break. From 1 to 3 it stays busy so im on my register til I get off at 3:15.
good,"Dollar General is a good place to work for, especially part time. The hours offered are reasonable. The upper management was very professional. All in all, a good place for a part time position."
good,working here was really great I almost made this my career.  I learned a lot and me and the co-workers were really cool. nothing in this job was hard other than cleaning the whole store by myself before the deadline.  I enjoy everypart on the job. the manager himself were really good.
good,I enjoyed working at the Dollar Store. I enjoyed my customers and the many different managers I had.
good,"On a typical day at work you are assigned the tasks of being a cashier, stocking the store, recovering the store and helping customers. I learned to know where everything is so that I have no problems assisting customers. The management was overall a great group of people who are all very friendly and helpful. All co workers were as well friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who stole. Its very unfortunate that people steal and hard to see them get dealt with as it it's an embarrassing situation to be in. The most enjoyable part of the job is conversing with customers and having customers tell you how good a job you're doing. Makes me feel like I earned my paycheck when they leave happy."
good,"great place to work , enjoyed working with others, helped other stores to remodel."
good,"A typical day at work for me is to manage my co - workers, Greet customers, Recover, and count money. I've learned how to work as a team member and be very responsible. I like to work at a fast paste and have something to do constantly, it makes my day go by quicker."
good,"i always had a good day at work,ive learned alot from  the store manager.i got along well with all the employees."
good,"I love working at the dollar general. In a typical day I interact with about 200 customers and run the cash register. When I don't  have any customer, I stock the shelves. My manager is a great lady to work for, she is understanding of the employees needs and will try everything she can when an employee is needing to work a specific day or hours. My co-workers are really good to work with and they will help whenever needed. The hardest part of my job is having to close the store. I have to mop the store and get everything ready for the next day when I work closing. The most enjoyable part of my job is my relationships I develop with my everyday customers."
good,I enjoyend bening on the team at dollar general.Having the keys to the store means alot to me I had to show the that I was worty to make tht mind of commint.
good,"I enjoy working at the Dollar Store and can see myself staying with this company for a long time, if moving up is possible. It becomes aggravating some days because in my store, sometimes other associated and myself work harder than some of the key holders and/or managers. For the most part I have wonderful co-workers. There all friendly, although some are not good teachers. I think that the training process should be more hands on than computerized. I myself learn better when someone shows me in person. The hardest parts of the job is truck day when we stock. Which it is not that bad except there is no good, clear cut system. We do something different every week.The pay for associates could be better. At least $8 an hour would be about right. We deal with very rude people talking to us in any kind of way. We work just as hard as the one making salary. My manager and assistant manager are wonderful. I feel as though sometimes my assistant manager is taken advantage of. All in al I believe this is a good group of people and a good company to work for."
good,"time usually goes by fast because they keep you very busy. there is never a boring day , there is always something to do or be done. you get paid every week, so that is great especially for a teen. working there is a team effort, no one can do it by their self. the most enjoyable part would have to be seeing costumers come in and leave out with a smile knowing you helped them."
good,"Good company to work for , hard work but makes day go by quicker."
good,Loved working here. Loved all the people I worked with. Very productive job and great exercising job. On your feet 90% of the time lifting and bending. Learned a lot here. Loved being able to get to know customers and help them in every way I could.
good,A typical day at work would envolve me4 working as hard as i can to make customers are satisfied. i wil always respect my co-workers. i will make sure that each part bof my job will be done to its full potential. An i will always enjoy making the customers smile.
good,"I learned how to set up a planogram, enter new stock in the handheld computers, and do reports associated with deposits."
good,"Dollar General was a great place to work. Always something to keep you busy, have regular customers you get to know well. The coworkers are your friends who help and keep the work place fun.  With new stock and sales almost every month, always a buy, crazy time."
good,I enjoyed working with the people and customers whether it be on the floor or on the cash register.
good,"I love going to work to see the awesome customers that choose to shop where I work. Also the great team of co workers. I've learned to work a cash register, change florescent lights and stock properly. "
good,I love the people that I work with and the fact that I have person to person interaction everyday. 
good,"My typical day at dollar general is I started at Noon and worked until 9, 5 days out of the week. I learned a lot about management, customer service, how to set up a good running store. My co-workers were great. I feel like i got most of the work done, and always did it to my best. My boss always was telling me how great of job i did on something. I always over exceed my expectations. The hardest part of my day is the after work rush hour when there is only one person on the register and one person on the floor, and I being the manager of the night, it got a little stressful, but nothing i couldn't handle. "
good,"Though the goals and policies upheld by Dollar General's Corporate Offices and Management Team are professional and casual in a new age kind of way, the system falls apart at a Store Level. Declining standards of Store Teams and Store Management are causing an inconsistent experience for customers. While just miles may separate two DG Stores, the difference in appearance and environment are startling. Some with clean sleek shelves, floors, and counters. Some with dusty, barren, rusted, bent shelves. With flooring scarred, and marked from years of abuse and neglect. I believe that part of upholding a brand or corporation lies in ensuring that all those involved understand and believe in the mission or goals  set."
good,Stock store stock back room make sure everything is put up in store corrtly make sure prices are right on items make sure products are in date 
good,"I was the store manager for Dollar General , it is a very good company to work for . I loved my job."
good,I really like the company and a really good place to work love the customer atmsophere
good,I traveled to other stores and helped trouble shoot problems with the managers. The best part of the job was all the wonderful people I met and the worst was by far all the travel required.
good,I loved working here. The company was fun. The people were extremely friendly. Sadly I had to move.
good,I liked being around the customers and I liked the way they treated there employees

good,its easy laid back the managers are amazing and work around your schedule very easily with no problems
good,Days were slow at times but the job was good overall. I learned how to stock and deal with imoatient customers. Managment was good and co-workers loved the job. The hardest part was being the only cashier when the place actually got busy. Most enjoyable part was closing.
good,"Fun to work her; you are primarily responsible for running the register, greeting customers, and unpacking merchandise and placing them in their proper space."
good,Toughest DM job ever. Different departments don't co-ordinate communication to you or the stores so it comes from every direction. There was no work/life balance. Very long hours. Upper management is fantastic! Terrific company.
good,Co-workers made my job enjoyable we helped one another. I loaded trucks and was able to do it without any boxes left on the dock. I learned how to successfully keep up a steady work pace throughout my workday. My supervisors were successful in teaching me my duties which required little or no supervision.
good,"My day will start out by seeing if the cashier's are having any problems and make sure that there is not any stock that needs to go out on the floor. I would assist the cashier with their refunds, voids, and exchanges. At the end of my shift I would straighten, mop, and sweep the floor. Before I leave work I would do the end of day deposit and set the alarms. Management was great and really down to earth. I enjoyed all my coworker they were very night people."
good,"Great place to work and great people to work for. I loved meeting the community and helping people while working at this facility. I liked the manager, she was great to be around and she made coming to work fun."
good,open and close store
good,"A typical day at work for me was like a walk in the park becasue I get along with others very well, do what is asked of me, and I try to have a very productive day of work. I learned that work is what you make of it, meaning it is bad if you make it bad anad it is good if you make it good. The management team was wonderful. They always get down to business, meaning whatever that its is that need to be done in the store they are on it before the regional manager think about telling them to do they already have it done.My co-workers and I got along veru well never had a problem with any of them loved the just like they were my sisters.The hardest part of the job I would say is on saturday when the truck come. The most enjoyable part of the job is my customers. Customers come first."
good,"i enjoy working with the customers helping them find what they needed, made them comfortable etc"
good,Had fun with coworkers but the managers came around we tended to get overloaded work but great experience. Sometimes I had to get up early than most because we had to unload some trucks at early mornings.
good,Customer friendly good awesome job would recommend others to apply to work at dollar general flexibility hours good driving distance would of like a little more pay for the job I was doing but overall it's was an awesome experience working for Dollar General
good,"When I started working at dollar general I loved it there and still do even now that I don’t work there anymore. They have great customer service, employees do there job by policy, etc."
good,My daily routine was to get the stuff from the back of the store and display it on shelves . Also I was a key holder. I would open the restrooms and void transactions
good,When I worked at Dollar General it was a fun environment I loved to go to work every day. I and my coworkers had fun at work. We listened to music on the speaker and we would sing while working and the customers loved to see that we all got along like a family.
good,It a good job and good pay hardest part of the job is stocking but you will be able to get it I liked working there it was the best working with people
good,"Awesome place to work depending on store and location, management is optional the store on prairie is awesome and has a wonderful manager. Hours are speradic never the same schedule."
good,Dollar General ensured a healthful work atmosphere. This company made me feel like I was part of their store by simply doing all required job functions.
good,It's an easy going job with very friendly co workers. They teach you thoroughly and manager is flexible with your hours. Good for people looking forwa
good,My day started off with a team meeting at beginning of our shift everyday. Then we broke off sepertately and began filling orders. After the orders was filled we then laoded them onto the semi trucks for shipment. The managenment team there is very hands on in helping to make sure orders are filled correctly and loaded and shipped correctly as well. The only hardest part about the job would have to be the heat in the factory.
good,This is a good company but I feel like the man's get paid more than women do! If I didn't get sick an had too choose between my job and my health I would still be working doing what I loved to do is keep my customers happy so they can keep coming back.
good,My experience was amazing at dollar General. Very friendly and respectful people. All of the other employees are willing to give a helping hand whenever needed. All most all of the time we got all of the goals met for that day. Definitely recommend dollar General for a job.
good,I was called in on a daily basis. I has a manager whod call me 16 times a days to cover her shift. But before she came and after she was replaced I had a very calm and professional work space where I was learning everyday and enjoying my job
good,"Dollar General has treated me well since i have been here. The hours and pay however just aren’t enough for me, although life isn’t all about money I would just like a little more pay hence the job searching! As far as co workers go mine have been wonderful!"
good,"Overall, the company is a very good company who goes out of their way to help ensure customer happiness. The people there are great and the work environment is very pleasant."
good,"As soon as I'd get in  I'd either begging to stock shelves or help the cashier with customers depending on the day and how busy we were at the moment. Stocking shelves, fronting the products and running the register are what consists of the day. I'd close and lock up to count the drawer then put the money in the safe at the end of the night ."
good,I had some awesome co-workers at dollar general. All of us worked as a team . My manager was positive and optimistic . My hard  work was appreciated by the company . I would appreciate the opportunity to work with Dollar General again.
good,"It's a super easy job and shifts are always available to pick up due to call offs, so it is easy money. I have a great management team so, no complaints! The pay is minimum, though. Maybe slightly above depending on the store budget at the time of interview."
good,"Nice working environment "
good,During the summer it was very busy and it was difficult to keep up with customers and other store duties. But besides that everyone was great to work with.
good,I started dollar general in august of 2019 and within less than 4 months was promoted to key holder! I've learned new things and love the regular customers!
good,The company looks out for their employees. They also offer benefits so their employees are able to sustain a balanced and healthy way of living. I really have enjoyed all the interactions I have had with customers and fellow co-workers.
good,It was a great job great people. Always something to do never a dull moment. Management is ran like a team. The hardest part of the week is working truck and cleaning sales floor after.
good,"I was getting paid $7.50/hour, was the only consistent and hard working employee they had. I asked for two days off weeks in advance because I was going to get my tooth pulled, my manager took me off schedule for that entire week except for two days. Management kept beating around the bush whenever I asked about a promotion (I was already trained to be a key holder, they just needed to promote me)"
good,Hiring manager could've been more accepting and understanding towards her employee's. I loved this job but I just needed more hours for better pay....
good,Had a great time working here but pay was hard to live off of. Employees here are helpful and nice and will help you find anything your looking for . It was a great experience to work here.
good,"It’s a great place to start out working at but there is a lot more to do than meets eye, so you’ll be busy if you like that, we have several bans on customers due to complaints from employees who were harassed as well as some shop lifters so you gotta learn quickly who they are because they will be quick to come in"
good,"I loved working at the store in Wellington, TX! I loved getting to know the small town people and they got used to seeing an unfamiliar face.... Weatherford, OK was not the best."
good,"Dollar general isn’t that bad of a place to work, i learned how to use an old computer, stock shelves and other things. The management is okay. Nothing really hard about the job."
good,Clean bathroom's recoverd the floors moped made sure customers where happy with there serves very very hard working worked when someone called off if she need me to come in to help clean I was there love my employees they where nice and helped anyway they could and I also help as much as I could
good,"My typical day at work clocking in on time, getting my drawer counting it with the money counter. To the amount of $300.00. Always being quick on my feet to make sure the consumer has their needs putting the customer first. Saying ""no"" to all scams that come through on the company phone. The most enjoyable  part of my job is being a great salesperson, and convincing."
good,Really enjoyed working with the people and manager I had. Very fun work place and loved the customer experience. Very nice associates and manager to work with.
good,"this job is all new to me, never have had a warehouse job before. so im still  learning everyday. work day starts at 5am and ends 330pm 4 days a week. i inventory the inbound part onto a tablet so im dealing w numbers and memory and math alot. there is alot to learn about this job and at times it overwhelming. im used to working around customers. this job im still not making the money i did at Richards Restaurant."
good,"working at Dollar General was a bit easy . The environment was pretty relaxed and it really wasn't a fast paced job. I learned to provide great customer service no matter how bad your day is going. The management there was okay she was respectful and a caring person. It really wasn't a hard part working there. The most enjoyable part was working with the ones I worked with. Also, getting to know new people and enjoying the customers."
good,Over worked under paid but I had a Great manger so that helped I left because she did and bad pay the jobs not hard though. I just wish pay was better for everything you have to do
good,Working for dollar general has been great. It’s the first job I’ve had since having my son and it’s a perfect fit. I really enjoy my coworkers and also have flexible enough hours to be able to spend time with my son and husband
good,Love working here and love the people I work with.  I do think some restructuring needs to be done as far as payroll hours are concerned. I receive 2 trucks a week and not many hours to complete the stocking therefore I tend to fall behind.
good,"Management interactions work life balance.   Benifits paid time off Great vendor relations interactions with all levels of management open door work policy"
good,It’s okay to work there just wasn’t paying me enough at all. But again it was a good place for a first job. Fast pace and slow pace. Some days are slower than others
good,Great place to start out in a new town. Excellent training. Wonderful management staff. Very laid back experience. Definitely recommend applying. Endless opportunity to move up.
good,"It was a good place to work, I felt like the training was very helpful at the one that I worked at. I enjoyed it, but also the pay wasn't up to par, I was lucky to get $8.00"
good,It was a good learning experience met a lot of friendly people learned how to be a more responsible worker and the management was the best feature of the store I worked out it was amazing
good,dollar general is a great store to work for everyone and everything is good. the only downside is the location of the store due to always being robbed.
good,Work head and always on time I would like me set my own work schedule and days I want to work I'll be good with whatever my boss gives me n that's fine.
good,This company is employye first. Advancement opportunities are great if you will relocate. One of the fastest growing companies in the USA! It is hard work but they pay sufficiently!
good,A typical day at work we would stock shelves make sure the store is clean and customer ready. Managment was good. I loved the people I worked with. We got things done that needed to be done.
good,It’s a great environment. I loved working for the company it was just a little confusing. It’s a great job to have long term just wasn’t what I was looking for.
good,I wish the hours was more consistent it’s a great job and great employees. Management was great it’s just lack of hours because the district manager offers certain amount of hours every week
good,If you choose to work for Dollar General it is good to have good communication with your store manager..and district manager..Dollar General cares about employee feedback..and there are many opportunities to grow within the company..
good,"I worked here as a high school student and i was also renting an apartment with my, now husband, it was hard to make ends meet and i never got the hours i was always promised but if you don’t live on your own then i would recommend it just for a starter job."
good,What Ive learned at Dollar General is that the customers look forward to seeing me every day and sometimes just come to the job just to see me for customer service.
good,"The District manager is awesome to work for, the atmosphere of the store was great and the area was great to work in as well, the benefits were pretty good."
good,At work the people were nice and enjoyable. Made working there easier. The customers were nice and polite and always sparked up a conversation. A typical day at work would be so relaxed that we would play old school or Christian music throughout the store.
good,a typical day at the dollar general was basically the same daily we go in turn off alarm set safe count in drawers for cashiers put everything in computer for daily opening then just stock help customers and do voids and returns. the hardest part of the job was checking in vendors
good,"I really enjoyed working with the Dollar General company. My coworkers were friendly and very welcoming to a new employee. Everything was easy to learn just had to remember lots of things, because customer's ask questions often. I left the job because I relocated."

good,i absolutely loved working for dollar general i got along great with everyone an we always had a great day at work. my manager was so sweet an always encouraged me to do my best
good,Great place to work. All you do is stock stuff and correctly put it in the correct areas. There is flexible scheduling and a great place to go to school and work.
good,I enjoyed working at Dollar General. Hours are flexible and time off when needed wasn't a problem. Management was always available to help with any problems that may come up.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Dollar General, but I was part-time and my weekly hours were quite low ( around 10 to 15 hours per week) while salaried employees worked more hours per day and per week. I only got paid minimum wage (7.25 per hour). No benefits other than a 10 percent store discount."
good,"Dollar general is a great place to work, with great  opportunities, and a great work environment. Dollar general truly puts customers first and it great to see how far they will go to make there customers happy."
good,"Dollar General is a very laid back company to work for, anyone could handle this job. They’re not asking for too much or too little of you, requirements are meet-able."
good,They change district and regional manager so often which make it harder on store managers. The pay for managers were great. They require alot of work from you but don't supply you with the proper payroll that you need.
good,"my favorite part of working here was being able to help others get what they like, help them with what they are looking for and so forth.. i love making customers happy"
good,"Nice company to work for, but Low Salary and not enough hours."
good,I learned many things I used to love my job I was happy that I had a great experience with the staff and the manager I wish I could be there again I well like to come back
good,"Basic retail environment. "
good,I never work for Dollar General before. I think it will be a great place to worked Yes I am looking forewarn to get hire by Dollar General management !
good,"too many kids constantly messing up the toy aisle, we closed down on time except for the times the system didn't except multiple coupons from customers, and the key rule if you only have 3 people manning a small store 2 stockers and 1 on the cash register and you have to hold up the line to void 1 item."
good,"A typical day at work is very productive. I learned how to use my time productively. The management was good, and they will try to help you with tips on improving your time. Workplace culture is good. The hardest part of the job is when you're on the night shift and have to work some nights until the next shift is there. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with your co workers and when there's free food."
good,"A typical day at work was most of the time always busy. My manager was a very friendly person that would always call me if she needed help and would call me in if someone else did not come in because she knew I did not mind. The hardest part of the job is trying to pleas everyone, because of this I've learned to be patient and to always keep a smile on my face."
good,"The hardest part of the day, I would have to say is the shift change at 3:00 pm. That's when the rush would come in. The easiest way to do a shift change is to wait for the rush to slow down."
good,Great management an decent hours. Low pay an no benefits. A lot of walking and standing. Have to be very charismatic to ensure the best quality of customer satisfaction.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to talk to people and help them find what they’re looking for. The hardest part of my job is not being able to help someone because we don’t have what they need in stock.
good,a fast pace work place. friendly workers and management was ok. the only holiday you get off is Christmas and most other holidays they don't even close early
good,"Busy"
good,I like the people I work with . The hours are flexible. The days pass quickly because we are very busy. There is always something to do. I am only leaving because I need to make more money.
good,"dollar general was a joy for me to work for and i would work there again given the chance, the people i worked with and the environment were amazing.."
good,It a nice company and I love to work with the managers in that company. The managers are all nice people and it fun Bcz we respect one and other emotions and feelings.
good,"Never had any complaints about the manager, and had a few bad employees but the job was good about weeding out those. I always felt relaxed and not pressured to over perform for the job in a risky fashion"
good,"fun place to work, enjoyed everything about it,made good friends with coworkers and customers,stocking shelves was fun meeting new people everyday being boss was a +"
good,"Working at dollar general was pretty conductive I enjoyed working there it's my second time working for dollar general I worked the evening shift because I loved to close & some of my favorite customers were coming in in the evening , the only to thing I didn't like about closing at night was lack of security other than that I enjoyed working to there being able to satisfy my customers"
good,"I enjoyed the experience there but I wanted more"
good,"I would arrive at work 15-20 min early ,clock I ,count my drawer waited on customers ,stocked shelves made sure dates on items weren't outdated did cleaning thru out the shift helped customers when they needed to find something hardest part of the job when customers complained about different things I really enjoyed talking to customers"
good,The store I was located at is very nice now when I got there we was working on making it look better inside and out and I drove by before I moved here
good,I got real sick I couldn't work had a doctor's note so my manager let me go but I love this job and did a very good job I also worked extra hours when someone calls in and took their place
good,A place to learn and grow with the company. I moved up quickly started out as a cashier and then got promoted to lead key holder in less then six months
good,"I really enjoyed my time at DG. It was a challenge, in that every day I learned something new. The opportunities are boundless if you apply the right energy and effort.  However, if you are a slow worker or just want a check at the end of the week, management will find a replacement for you."
good,"I loved working at Dollar General. I was by far the easiest and best job I've had. Super relaxed atmosphere with great coworkers that became like family. The store manager was always understanding and didn't have the annoying ""God complex"" that most bosses have. My favorite part of the job was stocking and my coworkers. Nothing about the job is hard, other than staying awake for the training videos. The worse part of the job would have to be the customers. Most were very pleasant, but it was an intercity store so we had some very undesirable customers who were sometimes threatening. The pay is nothing to get excited about. You either have to live with your parents, have two jobs, or (like me) have a spouse with a full-time job."
good,"Very busy,working with customers,i've learned i can do anything i set my mind to. it could be challening, but something that doesnt pay well.........."
good,"this was without a guess my most favor job in retail / sales . I learned alot hands on and up close for the 1st time wiith things , vendors , sales , stocking . how to manger shelfs and recovering your store  . also how to do staring banks and handle stores/banks money"
good,"Even though tho job hours and the pay wasnt enough for me to make a living on my own, i did enjoy working there and if it was offered to me id go back in a heart beat."
good,"I liked the way that I got to interact with customers. I liked being helpful and knowledgeable of store products and where they could be found. It was a friendly place to work,"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dollar General. I was in a high volume store that sold more than double  the merchandise than the company average. Generally understaffs its stores, so if there is a slacked onboard, it makes everyone work harder."
good,"I enjoy working at Dollar General. The setting is laid back but very fast paced. I love inter-acting with the customers that come in. The management staff at my location is very good. They work hard, everyone gets along and we're like a small family. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the shoplifters."
good,Be prepared to work. No guarantees on off time. Great job. Somewhat be in shape it’s a fast paced job! It’s always something to do! Based on production long as your on fast paced production is easy to make.
good,Dollar General is a good retail business to work for. Their rate of pay could been a lot better as they do not offer any form of employee discounts. Job advancements are always available.
good,Great place to work you can learn and build from this job due to having to perform so many task at hand all at once.  The job teaches you to count money prepare schedules handle hours and make sure your team is freight ready at ll times.
good,i liked working there employees were very nice & helpfull the hours were really nice didnt work to late and very fast career advancement very relaxed @ times
good,One day I was cashiering the next I was stocking. They move you around a lot. So you have to be versatile. It helps if you've done retail before or have customer service experience
good,"A typical day at work for me was having to be yelled at by a customer, if it was your fault or not. I learned to be patient with my work but also a lot faster at doing it. Management was pretty well always helping customers and employee's by far the hardest worker in the entire store. Workplace culture was pretty relaxed most days other than truck days trying to get everything off the truck and onto the floor but also trying to stay out of customers way was very difficult, also very stressful due to customers complaining sometimes about how the store is packed and you cannot move. The hardest part of the job honestly had to be the customers because you could not make all of them happy and a lot of them were not understanding. You would have to do your job but yet you were still the bad person for doing your job and not the way that they wanted. The most enjoyable part of working had to be the always moving part sounds strange but it was never slow when you were there always moving always having something to do."
good,I really enjoyed working there. Never had a unsatisfied customer. It was a nice environment overall. Getting to know how everything works and where it goes was easy. The working staff was incredible to get along with.
good,"Collaborative work environment. I really good place to work. however, it is quick-paced and steady. Working at Dollar General has really enhanced my people skills."
good,"I didn’t work there long, but it’s a great first job. I loved my managers and the environment. Most of the customers were great. It’s all about socializing."
good,I loved working at Dollar General. Most of the customers were really nice. Manger had a difficult time hiring and keeping employees. I believe it had a lot to do with the low pay they offer the employees. I believe upper management (assistant manager and manager) are well paid.
good,"Working at Dollar General was a very enjoyable place to work. You stayed busy whether you were checking customers out, stocking or cleaning there was never a dull moment. I Love to stay busy!"
good,14 years with company if there was a DG where I relocated I would have transferred. The company would rather promote from within. I went in with no retail experience moved up and within 2 years I had my own store.
good,It’s a good fast paced job if that’s what your looking for it would be good for you. If you like being around people and helping people it would be good to be at this job
good,"It’s really a great place to work. If you like working with customers, this is the place for you. The work was not at all strenuous, if you knew how to manage your time and multitask. Customers are usually very sweet and the staff was great."
good,Enjoyed the company greatly... My first job in a long time and advancement was fast. I would definitely recommend this company to anybody to work for. The main thing to remember is it is fast paced and you have to keep moving.
good,enjoyed working for this company because I enjoy to work with and help people. Very enjoyable environment. hardest part of the job is the amount of hours.
good,I love Dollar General and all that it brings in retail and customer satisfaction friendly every step of the way. The prices are good for your money and people are never that much cranky. They are always fine and make it easy for us cashiers for an easy checkout. I have no complaints.
good,"hardest part is getting quote on lift truck really like security guide it was great. but they hired it in, Managers were very good and willing to trained,"
good,"It is a great company to work for. A typical day at work isn't a very challenging one depending on the location of the store. The management of the store is okay, but it could be better."
good,"Every time I came to Dollar General, it was a great working environment. Majority of the time I was a cashier and when I'm not on cashier duty I spent my time stacking product and did inventory."
good,"Competitive, multitasking work, with enjoyable co-workers, flexible hours, never dull always busy, hard work in an enjoyable environment, and friendly surroundings"
good,Everyone is a team player and worked together to make the work place a great invirment for the employees and customers want to come back and shop with us again
good,Good work environement. Good pay. Good hours. Good management. Flexible hours. Fast paced & fun to work in. 3 or more breaks in a day including 30 minutes to an hour for a lunch break.
good,Had one of the best times working here and met cool people but the pay is not great so its hard to stay there for a career but great student job to make a little extra cash.
good,"A typical day at work runs smooth. We had this peak period from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. I called it rush hour where we picked up the pace because it was lunch time for workers all over our town. Other hours, other that peak period, we cleaned and stocked items needed through out the store. Things that I learned was respectfulness, quick with customers and guests but polite, and to provide good customer service. Engaging in small conversations, smiling and making sure they find everything needed and more. The management was completely amazing. He was and still is a very understanding manager to his employees. The culture at work was great. The hardest part of the job, honestly I can't say because it was never a challenge that I wasn't ready to face. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with others that made your job and atmosphere amazing. We  had good times but we all knew what we were there for and that we had a job to do."
good,"They run on small crew so calling in is a huge no no. Benifit of the small crew though is you feel like family. Good part time job for most, only managers get full time."
good,Typical small retail store. I enojyed my time at DG and that was in large part to the wonderful management team in my rural Illinois store. It was relaxed and fast-paced at the same time.
good,"Management was great with family needs, child care, sick employee, understood problems employees had. You saw new things and new people everyday! Great place!"
good,When the new manager showed up it was like she didn't know what she was doing. The lack of training I had almost caused me my job. Because I was just thrown in there.
good,The only thing I didn't like was the Long hours and low pay. In time I would of received a raise but the Salary would still be to low for what you have to do at the store.
good,The company gave me a chance to move forward in hard time to support my family for that I’m truly thankful. They worked with me when I needed to relocate and the manager was amazing.
good,Dollar General is somewhat a high and low point.  It all depends on where you are located.  Some of the stores are extremely too hot.  Others don't have proper management.
good,"Everyday at work was fun, but serious when it needed to be. I was able to joke around and talk about things, while also getting work done all the time. I learned more about dealing with customers, and furthered my knowledge with handling money items. Management was great, they were true leaders and were very understanding. For the most part there was no hard part about this job, besides the late night summer hours. I very much enjoyed going to work everyday."
good,"Overall fun place to work. Fast-paced but sometimes had ridiculous expectations for amount of hours given. Good people to work with. Higher ups could be better, seen examples of favoritism."
good,I got a decent amount of hours every week. management was great. The customers that came in were not the greatest but the manger always to care of that
good,"work,work,work on your feet alot always busy,but great place,management was great one I  finley got one I had to quite,because of a man. will not happen agian I left him for good this time"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dollar General, I became very familiar with the neighborhood customers and knew most of them by name. The store was located in a neighborhood where most of the customers were walkers."
good,Dollar general is and great place to work to can lean a lot of thing about the store you can promote very quick if you are willing to work and be on time i really enjoy myself
good,Dollar General is an excellent company to grow with . Vast opportunities for advancement . Most people are great . Like with all companies the size of Dollar General you may come across some whom are so personally driven they walk right over you but these are rare .
good,Performing all manners of customer service and keeping the store neat and stocked.I started entry-level and ended knowing some store manager duties. I think it is a great place to work. I had plenty to do to keep busy which made the day fly by. Loved helping customers.
good,"Really wasnt much to do there but clean, put away stocks, making sure customers were satisfied. Sometimes it was slow and other days it was busy. Handling lot of money"
good,I loved this job. If my store didn't flood in Oklahoma I would still be there. I was so much fun to feel responsible and make great friends while doing it.
good,"I loved working for dollar general at the location I was at. The employees are hard working with awesome personalities, and my boss was very productive and responsible, a very respected woman. I didnt intend to leave that job. I had to quit because the job became too far for my commute with not having a baby sitter for my child after moving across town. Dollar general has been the best all around job that I've had so far."
good,Decent Job if you are focused on learning retail. Coming to work and going home is what is required to remain an employee instead of gossiping with the adult kids
good,"I was a cashier so I did customer service. I stocked all the things that had to be stocked when the truck arrived. Food, makeup, shoes, cleaning supplies etc. I closed the store down every shift I worked there."
good,"Always customers coming in, never a dull moment.  there is always  something to do.  The co-workers are the best to work with,they will  help if asked."
good,Dollar General is an enjoyable place to work. There are many different daily tasks to complete to keep you busy. Associates have to stock shelves and know how to read shelf labels for correct product placement. There are weekly price changes and displays that have to be done. Associates also ring up purchases and help customers.
good,"I absolutely love working at dollar general. All the other employees are very nice and friendly to you, other employees, and customers. It has a very positive atmosphere. The manager is also very nice and understanding."
good,"Dollar General is a good company to work for, the literacy fund is so awesome.I got a lot of managerial experience and had good insurance. A good place to work.."
good,a typical day at work I check customers out I stock shelves I mop I also unloaded trucks clean the stock room got baskets from outside I also counted my register down at the end of the day
good,"I loved this job.  My managers were amazing, caring people. My job was stocking, cleaning, and assisting customers with locating items and personal recommendations. I love staying busy and helping and working with the public so it was the perfect job for me."
good,Just can't live off the hours they give me. Store messy. Could use more ppl working to clean store up. And stock room so full u can barely move in back room
good,"A typical day at dg is prety relaxed, I started as fronting and stocking moved up to cash register, continually worked as stocker and ran register. "
good,Every day i learn something new.on a typical day i am in a friendly environment pleasing and helping our customers.there is manageable management at our work place. The hardest part of my job is probably stocking and putting things in the right location. The most enjoyable part of my job is i get to help people.
good,"how to multitask and to put stuff up in a fast manor and how to help customers faster by helping them find what they need but also having a great understanding tea, when my sister in law passed away in a car wreck on my graduation day. The hardest part was to get along with rude customers. most enjoyable park was making friends and having fun in a great work environment."
good,I loved working with this company i was sad to have to leave because of personal reason if i had the opertunity to go back to this company i would gladly
good,Poor Management when I was there but they have a better one now. They have everything you need. Employees are really nice. They have a no tolerance policy.
good,You are expected to do a lot so be ready to work. The job is fast paced and never the same. You will stock shelves. clean the store and take care of customers.
good,"A typical day consisted of stocking shelves, providing customer service. As third key holder I held responsibilities similar as management such as counting down money at the end of shift and delivering money deposits."
good,Enjoyed meeting the public and helping them with their purchases work hours were plentiful until my manager hired a family and gave my hours to their family member went from working 40+ hrs to 8 hrs per week
good,Company has great job advancement opportunities. The managers from district manager to regional directors respect and cared for their employees. Hard work pays off
good,I love coming to work there I love being the lead their everyday was a fun place to go at another had a stressful day the customers were very friendly and they need me by name and the manager was very friendly as well
good,Great place work . loved the atmosphere and my team of employees. My boss was a considerate person and always made sure we were comfortable with our job.i would recommend dollar general as a job to anyone.its   a good way to learn retail.
good,"If you have a desire to work hard, your work is rewarded with an incentive based pay program. If you do not like physical labor I would not recommend job for you"
good,"I shared my position with only a few other coworkers so shifts were easy to find. Taking time off was difficult, even if it was a special day like a personal birthday or emergencies."
good,It's a good place to work. My manager is understanding and one of the best managers I've ever had. My fellow employees are great. I am just burned out on being a retail cashier.
good,"There is never a lack of work to be done. It is fast paced customer service oriented. Everyone pretty much helps out with everything stocking, cashiering, sales stickers, and overall general cleaning of the store ."
good,"I was in a small store, not many employees. Lots of responsibilities. Lots of time spent Facing Merchandise. Always busy in small stores because of low amount of employees."
good,"The company is world renowned. The hours were regular business,  everyone was out 10 minutes after closing time. The management listening to suggestions for selling merchandise and which made the working environment foster creative thought."
good,"A typical day is good, fun, enjoyable, and productive. I learned how to do a lot of new things at dollar general like shelving, planograms, and to do displays. I learned how to bond with people and that the customers aren't just customers they are humans to. Management is great. The hardest part of the job is to balance a busy day of rushing to get the store stocked and to check out customers at the same time, but you get thru it once you can balance the pace and get yourself a system going. I enjoyed my job. It was very manageable for me and i had a great time seeing new customers, the regulars, and the kids were awesome too. They always had a story to tell."
good,This is a great Company to work for I just wished more hours were available. I was only given 10-12 hours a week which is not enough to survive on. All around it is a fantastic place to work with great managers and co-workers that become life long friends. It is very relaxed and positive environment. The work is easy and anyone could do it. I enjoyed my time working here and wish I did not have to move to another job.
good,Very good company to learn retail in. A lot of opportunity available to grow within the company with hard work and dedication. Management team is aimed to succeed.
good,I wish I could still be working there. It was an awesom e experience and the store manager was great. They work with a flexible schedule. They are all around an excellent company to work for
good,good. I rang register and stocked the shelfs. it is a good company to work  for. I worked five days a week. they paid good. all of the workers were very nice and the managers.  the customer were very nice.

good,"its a great place to work theres always work to do. I love helping customers, You can move up from cashier to key holder or lead sales associate to assistant manager."
good,"Always enjoyed greeting the new customers as well restocking the shelf's ,answering the phones,keeping the stores clean for the District manger I just enjoyed working for there company."
good,"I go in and make check to see what needs to be stocked, cleaned and recovered.  I assign the employees to be on the register and the ones to be in the store.  I am usually in the store helping and being available for customers.  I give breaks and make sure everything is completed before the store closes.  I count the registers and run the end of the day reports and set the store up for the next day, so as to make it as easy as possible for the opening manager."
good,"A typical day a work was like any other job, not to hard and not to eas, just enough to keep you busy throughout the work shift. Although working there was a blast the mangament wasnt all to great, the manager would slack her way through the week until last minute then she would last minute complain to all of us until the job was done that we should have been doing all week."
good,I had a great boss who taught me things. Great customer service atmosphere. There are a lot of skills for that job that keep it different each day. Great to get to know your customers.
good,"You are always on the move, there is not if at all any down time for those who are managers. The life/work balance is something that you as a manager have to fight for. You can pretty much make your schedule, but if you want a successful store you will be there 90% of the time."
good,I love working at Dollar general its amazing . I love my mangers and other staff members its great. I really enjoy how they work around my schedule . I love my job .
good,I enjoy working for Dollar General. The management team has great personal skills and cares about their workers The job is fun and i enjoy the interaction with the customers
good,I would help first find a specific item and also I give tips on products to help make sales . it is always laid back and had a good environment . keep all items organized
good,"It is very fast paced, the worked are nice there and will teach you everything you need to know. The manager is really nice and he takes care of his employees when I worked there he was really nice and helpful. The people that came in there were rude sometimes, but that's going to happen anywhere, you just have to know how to handle situations like that. The hardest part of the job is when their was a lot of customers in line and only one cash register worked at the time and its hard trying to find the manager because she's doing morning important things. Uhh the most enjoyable part to me about the job when I worked there was I didn't hate it lol it wasn't hard at all really as long as you took care of your section and had an eye on that register you'd do fine :)"
good,"Store location is a very busy location, always running the register and helping customers any spare minute i had i worked on stock. I learned a lot about customers and their preferences and how recognition from co workers motivates you the most! The hardest part of my job was probably not being able to keep up with customer demands and the best part is definitely the friendly co-workers!"
good,Awesome place to work..loved the people and my co-workers. I didn't work there long cuz pinched my sciatic nerve and had to quit and recover. Fast pace place.
good,"I still shop there regularly. I enjoyed working there, I took pride in my store and the appearance. Never was disrespectful to my customers, managers, or DM's."
good,"i would open store, ring up customers, unload trucks , stock shelves, close store. i really enjoyed working for this company, i enjoyed working in the public."
good,"I enjoyed working with all co-workers and our customers.  My manager taught me well and I was often recommended to fill in for managers who went on vacation, were on medical leave, or dismissed from the company.  I also enjoyed training new employees and manager trainees."
good,"Offers a great opportunity for advancement. Needs a better training program for management. There is little to no work/life balance for store managers. Enjoyed working with most employees, the hardest part was actually having to terminate some employees. Most enjoyable part was the customer service"
good,"Learned how to do a lot of thing stocking,  how to be a cashier, talked to people, wanting to go to work. Got to see people from all over. It was paying really good I was working and I was getting  for want I was working for."
good,"I have only been working at Dollar General for only a few months, but I have learned so much from this job."
good,"In my short time here I had many great experiences with both my co workers, manager, and most of all the customers. There wasn't much room for advancement how ever, but i still would recommend them to anyone looking for a good start."
good,"I worked there as the Assistant Store Manager and learned so much. When I transferred to help another store manager, that's when it went downhill. She wrote me up 9 times for asking for help only on certain things I didn't know."
good,Need more hours and pay rate. Very friendly place to work and customers are always nice. Always needing new hires. Wish had things free. We can't take a sip of the beverage we're about to pay for till after we pay for it.
good,"I enjoyed my employment at BP. A typical work day included me open cash, and cashing out consumers. I worked typically by myself on a shift and handled everything in accordance. That included cleaning, stocking, and reports. The hardest part of my job was the weather. It didn't make the job bad, just longer to shovel or salt the parking lot for safety of our consumers. Management was kind, but could not provide the hours I needed to provide for me and my family. I learned communication skills, multitasking skills, and the ability to work alone and make decisions based on knowledge of the job field."
good,"-each day comes with its own set of challenges "
good,I loved my coworkers and customers. My manager was very nice making the schedule so I could take and pick my kids up from school.............. I just wanted a different kind of job.
good,"Its a good place to work, whether its a starting job, or a temporary job, the people their actually care about you, they train you for everything you need to know."
good,I was kitchen manager for servel different correctional facilities....I got to travel different places/cook/train/order/learned a lot about different people.
good,Handle calls work with the public stock product and making sure every customer is satisfied. Love reviewing all products and explaining things to customers
good,"Excellent place to work, job advancement usually occurs fairly quickly. Benefits and vacation upon advancement and decent hours. Weekly pay and annual raise. Diverse cultural experience and for the most part a friendly environment."
good,"Typical Day at Work: If alot of customers, the stocking process is held up but love the customers and cashiering"
good,"Picking, and preparing orders. Fast past business with good benefits and over all good atmosphere............................................................"
good,"I loved going to work everyday.it was just a good place to be.we all got a long.It was a hard job but,we all worked together and got it done."
good,"i loved working here, i started as a cashier and within 9 months i was promoted to Assistant lead key holder / night supervisor. advancing in customer service first hand, and the management is excellent as well as the coworkers."
good,"Fantastic work experience! Typical days I stayed busy, which I love. Also, working with great management and co-workers were a great thing. There really wasn't a hard part of the job and I really enjoyed working with people."
good,"I love working with my crew, They are all great people."
good,Good work environment. Friendly people. Regular customers. Flexible hours. Clean and organized facility.
good,Retail is just not my thing. Working for minimum wage and getting paid every two weeks is not my thing. I deserve so much more so I left and looked for it.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, productive and enjoyable. I learned how to run cash registers and deal with the public. Management was great. My co-workers were always nice. The hardest part of my job was dealing with disrespectful customers. I enjoyed everything about my job at Dollar General."
good,Productive place to work. Loved working with the staff in previous job. Hardest part was being short-staffed and trying to meet tight deadlines.
good,Good company to work for. Benefits and compensation are terrific. Management is very micro focused on tasks. You have access to all types of reports and information to perform your job.
good,"I ran the cash register and when I didnt have any costumers I stocked shelves and straighten products on the shelves. I didnt really learn anything new in this position, I have used a cash register before and I have alot of costumer service experience. The co workers were fun to work with."
good,The management staff is easy to work with and good at working around pre scheduled appointments. A typical day is greeting customers making sure the store is stocked and in great appearance view of customers. There's really no hard parts about the job.
good,Defeinatley I've had a good experience working with Dollar General it was fast pace but it was something I was able to do friendly customers and an outstanding manager and supervisor.
good,"There is always something to do to keep you busy, from stocking shelves to helping out our customers.  You are able to interact with customers on a daily basis and I enjoy that."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my employees. They are great people and take pride in their store. Our customers are great and really enjoy coming into a nice open and clean store. I would say the hardest part of the job is stocking days. And management, the District and Regional Managers are awesome. You have a problem they are on it. All and all a great company to work for. I enjoy my time there."
good,"put the shelf up and then stock the shelves"
good,"It's a great and steady growing company.Lot of chances for advancement.Nice place to work,need to change some managers because of how they treat employees.Everywhere has a bad apple or two."
good,"I really liked working for Dollar General. I quickly advanced from cashier to management within a short period of time. I learned a lot about retail business working for them. I also learned a lot about management in this company. I enjoyed most all the people hired on to work there. For some reason Dollar General has a very high turn over rate. The most enjoyable part of the job was setting different seasonal displays. The hardest part of the job was making sure my stock counts  were right, as it is a scan base trade store."
good,"Most days were spent stocking, maintenance and helping customers find products. Very easy going atmosphere even during rushes, the only exception being irate customers. Everyone worked together most of the time. The hardest part for me was figuring out where money was short/over at the end of the day."
good,Love working and talking to new people. Worked with me on scheduling with my son and school.  My manager was great person to work with.
good,"I enjoyed my time with dollar general. I loved and enjoyed almost every single day I worked there, the pay was just not where I wanted it to be at the time, that is why I had to leave, if the pay was a little more I could have easily stayed with them for years to come. a very nice and respectable company."
good,"Dollar General is one of those jobs that makes you feel like its your second home. Management is amazing at the store level. GM's usually care about just the numbers but that is their job. The generally small stores make it easy to know where everything is so that you can help customers find exactly what they need. If moving up in a company is something you want to do then this is a great company to try, within a year I was promoted from a cashier to a 3rd key manager."
good,"The most important experience from this job was customer service. At dollar general I learned about people, and culture. On a average day I would interact with around 100 people, doing this on a weekly basis help me learn an incredible amount of things. I learned about body language, vocal clarity, different cultures, cuisine, politics, literature, and music. After working her I understand how to interact with people on a expert level."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. My typical day at work was always fun and exciting. I learned how to stock. My co-workers were all friendly. My hardest part would have been when I had to leave. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the company.
good,"Great experience in dealing with the public. I was allowed to present my genuine person in the face of the public. Therefore, I was allowed to change myself for the good of the public."
good,I really liked my co-workers and the job of helping new hires. It was a rewarding thing to help someone learn a job and make them feel comfortable.
good,Challenging environment for anyone looking to advance in the workplace. Many opportunities to serve your community through engaging in sales.
good,I have to say at first I wasnt sure how it would be but I really enjoyed the time when i worked here. I typically worked the early morning/ mid shift and time always went by fast. I had great management that made everything fun and competitive. I got paid very decently for a retail job and would definitely work here again if I needed.
good,"Loved interacting with different cultures and people every day and providing a good attitude with people, being able to make their day a little bit better when it came to customer service and working with co-workers that were very positive and loved their job just as much as I did."
good,Job would of been better had the current manager been in charge then. This job is not bad for a local person who isn't afraid to work.
good,"Learning experience,always loved being in customer service .Job is a fast past job which I enjoyed hours were limited. Had a great Manager to work for just not enough pay for the duties required /was offered advancement but again the pay just less then responsiblites required."
good,"Arrived early morning to implement cashing handling and set Store up to open, gained valuable experience in finance, organization and people skills, learned to interact with people of all background and life's situations. Taught me to recruit valuable resources, in a sometime limited pool of people.  Learn to motivate, teach and use the strength of people I supervised. Learned valuable merchandising skills."
good,"Good people, decent pay, good benefits, Good atmosphere, Managment was great to work with us when we needed time off, or if something came up. I loved the people here."
good,"Dollar General gave me a wonderful opportunity to gain customer service skills. I also gained management experience. Dollar General is very fair in that every employee is required to stock, run register, and recover the store. We all work as a team. I really enjoyed working for this company but now that I am done with school I want to create a career for myself."
good,A typical day at work considered me to build relationship with co-workers and allowing me to learn team work.  The co-workers were people i'll consider as family. The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of my shift because it was like i loved working there but had to clock out when it was time due to the lack of hours giving to me. I love to work and coming in contact with different people; I'm a people person.
good,"A typical day at work involved handling cash, stocking, store recovery, clean up, and customer service. Being a shift leader was a great experience and i feel that i benefited greatly from it."
good,"Very fun and customer service focused. "
good,"I enjoyed my responsibility while there, I love to help out whenever and wherever I was needed, the work day flowed smoothly due to my overseeing the procedures."
good,"As keyholder, there was always work to be done. a typical day would be opening or closing the store, handleing deposits, setting up displays and plan-o-grams for new merchadise, recieving our DG truck, maintaining the cleanliness of the store, and ofcourse, providing great customer service."
good,I worked in a town that has a very very high turnover. I went through 6 different district managers while there for two years. It is also a very busy area so there is always something to do. So if you like to stay busy this is a great place to work. I was pretty lucky and had a pretty good team so day to day was nice. It was hard to keep changing who my district manager was because then you have to learn their ways each time. Mostly they stayed out of the way because our store never had issues. Management needs to learn that this is a special area and needs extra attention and maybe to adjust their procedures or plans to fit the issues. The stores could be much more successful if they figure out a better plan.
good,"open"
good,Have fun dealing with and helping customers. I learned excellent customer service techniques from this job and cashiering skills.
good,"I never dreaded going into work, I advanced to a key holder within 3 weeks of being employed . Co-workers and customers made my work day go by so quickly. All in all, it was a great place to work."
good,Managers are  wonderful and helpful. There is always someone just a call away to help with any problem. Managers help were needed and a district manager is wonderful and supportive.
good,"I would run the register, stock shelves and count down the register"
good,I loved the people I worked with they were very funny and outgoing people. The regulars that came in were so nice to talk with and made my job a lot more fun to work at. I love that my manager trusted me enough to rearrange shelves and file papers and would give me more responsibility than just working the register. I love learning new things and at this job I was able to do that.
good,"very productive days,busy days, most enjoyable  is the nice staff. management was very on top of things. hardest part was robberies and theft. very unsafe store."
good,"It was great to work there loved management, great people to work around. and with. didnt like all my co workers but my manager was nice."
good,"Awesome company to work for in the retail world. Ample room for advancement at several levels. Community based company, A lot of fund raising we do stays right in the communities we are located in from our literacy foundation to our local food drives.

The most enjoyable part of working for dollar general was working with my co workers who were very helpful whenever I needed it."

good,"I liked working at Wal-Mart but they started giving really low hours. But i loved stocking and unloading trucks. Also I liked working at Dollar General as a cashier, i liked being a cashier but they didn't give me any hours at all."
good,U come in to work about 8 o'clock in the morning get you draw from your manger on duty. normanly you would have to clean up after the night shift so we would get started on that . Then start stocking the beens helping customers any way posable . i love it ther just did not get enofe houres.

I would love to go back and work there again."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was taking care of the customers and making sure the store was in tip top shape for them. My employees that were under me made sure that the store was always fully stocked and price matching. When inventory came it went smoother because of the team that I had backing.
good,It is a lot of work if you do not have the right team in place.  I learned that if you do not have people who are willing to work with you in the job then it is going to be very hard to maintain a positive environment for the customers to visit.
good,"Greeting customers, on feet all day, stocking, running cash register, cleaning up and closing."
good,Dollar General is a company that is growing every year. I have learned that teamwork is a very important aspect of my daily work day. The management team of Dollar General is a great group of people to work under. They respect their employees. The hardest part of my position is the heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with other employees.
good,I worked as a Cashier and had an easy time each day I came to work.

good,"Typically the days at Dollar General were very busy, I learned to adapt to different personalities since I was dealing with hundreds of customers. Within the three years I was employed with the company, we had several Store Managers, most were beneficial to the company and to myself as far as educating me in the position I held. The hardest part of my job was trying to be in four or five different places at one time. There was only myself and a cashier per shift  with hundreds of customers and I was responsible for a lot of tasks alone and help cashier with her customers. Luckily, I made it through the shift sane and with a smile though. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was to be able to help people in a quick and hassle free way."
good,"As any job has, there are some things that were difficult to handle, but overall I enjoyed the job. The customers and other co workers were pleasant to work with."

good,I had fun working with customers and making sure everything was organized and put away. I loved working with my coworkers. We always had teamwork going on there.
good,"Working a Dollar General was a great experience. you have a good chance of moving up as long as your qualified. a basic work day as a manger you normally open so you come in at 6 am and leave around 330-4pm  but you learn how to  check in venders and you set the stores for the different season through out the year. Co-workers and management are great, everyone was friendly."
good,"Worked well with the public"

good,Pretty Good Job great pay flexible scheduling overall great work place
good,Enjoyed customers and the little kids that came in.  Management was great.  Breaks was even great.  Had to unload truck and put it up on the same day.
good,My typical day at work was a 9-10 hour shift managing about 10-15 people a night closing the store most of the time. My hardest part of the work hour was making sure the paper work was correct and the cash was deposited correctly. the most enjoyable and most important part was greeting the customers coming and leaving.
good,"My typical day at work would be come in clock in and then stat ringing up m customers and helping put stock out if there are any totes left from earlier that day. and from 3:30 until 6pm I work by ringing up customers and then at 6pm until 6:30 I am on lunch and when I come back around 8pm that night me and my manger start to sweep mop and get the trash and start to bring the products from outside into the store before we get to close up for the night. "
good,"A typical day at work it very fast paced. While working at dollar general I learned how to maintain a positive attitude during tough moments, to be a team worker and leader. I also learned to treat others like I want to be treated. I had a great boss, she worked well with my schedule while I was in school, she was very fair and treated everyone the same! I really did not find anything hard about my job, just tried to remain positive while I was on my shift and took care of what needed to be done. The most enjoyable part of my my job was my co workers they are very good people and easy to work with!"
good,A typical consist of me counting down money and helping customers
good,This job required hard work but I loved the people I work with. The pay could have been better.
good,"You really get to know a lot of your customers, being in a small town store like this one was. It was really fast paste during rushes but they were far enough between that you were able to take your time and help people like you should be able to.Management was there to tell you what needed to be done, but most of the time trusted that you would be able to do the job without hovering, but they were always there when you needed them. The hardest thing about working at DG would have to be getting the truck unloaded and on the shelves quickly with minimal damage to product, while at the same time helping out any customers who were in the store, and depending on when the truck arrived could be anywhere from a few people to dozens at a time.  The most enjoyable part is getting to know the customers and other co-workers, being able to help someone pick out the perfect gift for a loved one, or helping them decide which pattern they really wanted to go on the table cloth. You got some pretty crazy people in the store sometimes, but you always had fun exchanging stories about them with the other employees."
good,"I became a store manager in 2011.  Once I became a store mgr. I was working about 70 hours a week.  Upon leaving we were on our third DM.  He had just recently took our district over three months before I left.  I quit because I felt like he didn't appreciate his employees, and was disrespectful.  I have been in retail management for twenty years.  I have always enjoyed helping people, as well as meeting new people.  The previous two managers would speak highly of my character.  I was always very dependable.  Even during the weeks, leading up to days before my father passed away.  I would have to ask for my vacation on numerous occasions before I would finally get it.  Even when I quit, I still had a weeks vacation, I had asked the DM on two occasions to take it, and never got an answer.  I was still getting phone calls from Interface Security up until May 2013.  I was with the company since 2007, and would very much so still be there."
good,"A typical day at work involved counting cash drawer pre-shift, operating cash register, greeting and assisting customers, getting change when needed, stocking shelves, checking in vendors with handheld scanner, supervising two to three employees, processing receiving truck, organizing freight, performing stock counts, on hand counts, inventory, setting up planograms and merchandise displays, light to moderate cleaning of the store including sweeping and mopping, performing opening and closing procedures including walking through the store, counting down cash drawers for morning shift, preparing bank slips for bank deposit, assisting store manager in any other duties as needed. I learned how to multitask at a low level professional area, I learned how to go out of my way to help the customer, I learned how to be a manager on duty and provide proper training to new employees. The hardest part of the job was having two to three days to stock all the freight from the receiving truck, as we had other assignments/duties that needed to be started on Mondays. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with such amazing employees. "
good,"Work, Work, Work. A typical day for me is non stop from the time I clock in, until the time I clock out.  I have learned discipline and hard work pays off.  My manager, like I have mentioned, is strict and expects a 150% from me.  I often pick up my co-workers slack, and have to do my job and, in addition, what they were ""supposed to do"".  The hardest part of my job is making my manager 100% satisfied. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I completed everything I was asked to do and more."
good,it was a hard day like any other jobs but it was overall satisfying

good,stocking the shelves
good,"I liked working for the company they had great pay, but it was hot alot and hard work having to stand and work fast."
good,Its an enjoyable place to work especially if you like meeting people and working with the public!
good,I learned alot about working with the public most being very friendly and polite and I also learned to deal with difficult situations with customers. Management needed a little help they didn't seem to enjoy their job and eventually left and things went hay wire. Hardest part of job was I hardly had any family time with my three daughters because I was in the store more than the manager most weeks.
good,"Checked out customers on cash register cash,credit,checks and EBT. Restocked shelves when I had time."
good,I was a cashier and stocked shelves on the evening shift. Working in a small community and geting to know the likes and complaints to work toward customer satisfcation was my goal.
good,"I really felt like it was my home away from home, my fellow employees felt like family and we always made the work fun somehow."
good,"I had finally moved into my own apartment. So I looked for a job and Dollar General was available for me to show my skills. It came very easy to me to greet, talk and help all the customers. Once you figured out your way around the store, I'm sure you could handle it in your sleep!! The staff was wonderful, I had descent hours and had time to spend with my son. The only reason I left this job is because my son was getting older, gained more bills so I had to move up on the charts. I would very well recommend this job to a friend if they needed to get over a fear of communicating with other people!"
good,"Good work good hours good pay good benefits friendly job "
good,Be ready to work hard.  There is always work to be done.  Be on time.  Do your work.  Always wear your name tag.  Follow directions.  Read.  Go above and beyond and this job can pay off.
good,A great job experience for people who are looking for their first job. Schedules are fair for students and people who want to have something to do on the side.
good,Not a bad place to work. The pay is not worth it though.. my store manager barely does anything. I do have great associates although. The place is constantly a mess and I’m constantly cleaning it due to my store manager for my position I feel the pay sucks and it’s not worth it my store manger works 48 hours a week and I’m lucky I get 34...
good,A good job to get on your feet very well managed and great staff and work balance in life they will work with your schedule and flexibility in work and home
good,Overall it's nice some days can be rough around the edges. Pay could be better and the benefits. Unloading can be a hassle if you have bad truck men..
good,Need a better store manager who treats everyone equally and not talk about them behind your back other then that it's a great place to work at and make sure to get your job done and having a good customer service
good,"I’d go in at 5am get all my stuff together, grab my cart and start putting stuff up on shelves and making it look nice for everyone to see and everytime I’d see my manager she stop say hi and sometimes help out"

good,I like everyone I work with . I see the same customers regularly which I made relationships with. The work is easy and there is always something to do.
good,"Stays very busy, hard to get employees that wanna work like you do. At the start it was going well, then the hrs got dropped and I would have to cut hrs and work them myself.  Felt like the other stores got more hrs and help then my did"
good,My particular store I do not feel was a fair representation of the company as a whole. We changed management a few times from district managers to store managers. This did not allow me sufficient time to really assess the management long enough to form a solid opinion.
good,"A work day at Dollar General is very fast paced and busy.You meet so many people throughout the day. The customers almost always bring a smile to your face and its always nice to be able to provide your customers with what they need or at least to be able to answer their questions or find someone who can. I learned that I personally love to interact with people, so while ringing up my customers products I formed many friendships and looked forward to seeing them each day. I also learned that I like a busy atmosphere.You lose track of time when you are busy. it makes one feel very good to look back and see all of the hard work you have done and to relax at the end of the day knowing what you have accomplished.The management at Dollar General was very considerate and caring when I was an employee there.I had no problem with breaks when I worked there and management was flexible when it came to me needing to take days off or needing a ride to work when I was without a car.I hardly ever had a problem with my hours or having to work unschedualed hours and if I did they adjusted them for me.The hardest part of the job was standing too long in one place.I like to move around a lot, so on those days where it became very busy and lines were thirty minutes to an hour long at our registers,this was a little stressful.I believe that my experience at Dollar General,all in all has taught me patience."
good,"The mangers were organized and approachable. I love this company. The managers were understanding, they were always available to answer any question that I had."
good,"Loved working at dollar general, great employees and management. Always a clean environment and awesome customer service provided to every customer that walked through the door."
good,I was responsible for keeping the store organized & clean. I also worked on the register for long periods of time. While working here i learned better community service.
good,"To be honest, are was so excited, and move be everyone friendly behavior, and are learn a lot things, like something's prices,helping other locate where thing I, getting to know  new people, how to be polite to customers, patient, consistence, and ways to answer  a customer, taking others  and following instructions."
good,"Today I went in and worked on the truck, ran the register while another employee took lunch, then went back to the truck.  Two hours before we closed i swept and mopped the floors.  ran the register for the last half an hour.  Helped count money and close."
good,I enjoyed the customer service experience with this being my first tax paying job. It was a great work environment as I got to interact with new customers each day
good,You are really working hard and a sales assiocates do most of the work. Management does not help you. You are mostly on your own. I struggled with getting out on time.
good,"This is good job if your people person,able  to communicate with customers,have a good team for success of store.You have to always stay focused on tasks,projects and activities to meet your goals."
good,It was an easy and fun place to work. I really enjoyed working there. It was really close to my house. It was one of the best retail jobs i've had in a long time. I was able to meet some very interesting people.
good,The job over all was a good experience. The management I worked under was amazing. They worked around my schedule and so many times switched shifts for me to able to work the needed hours.
good,"I worked for dollar general over five years went through different managers and employees and I learned the steps of  becoming a manager being a dependable worker and flexible working sometimes  seven days a week. I worked cashier, stock and recover the store train new workers set plantagrams and magic table occurring to the season."
good,I love doing my job at the dollarstore ihave done it all from running the register to submitting payroll. I throw freight almost by myself . but it gets done if I have a job to do I do it right the first time
good,"When i was working at Dollar General it was fast paced , and steady cashiering. I enjoyed the people I worked with. The customers was great. I would like to work there again."
good,I loved the environment i was in . The company as a whole is not a great company to work for. The pay isnt sufficient and there is no benefits. But my store manager made the environment so that you wanted to come to work. We as a crew were always laughing and got work done.
good,"The days people would call in , I would be the one to cover their shift. I work  hard everyday . Anything a customer had a problem with I made sure they had a better experience."
good,"If you are up beat and motivated, love a fast pace work environment, people, planning and organizing. This is the job for someone with an up beat personality and Can do Additude."
good,"Started a as key holder and then moved up to Assistant Manager in about a month because of the support of the store manager there. He seemed to have a professional liking in myself, which was great for both of us because I could fill in when he needed to be off for the day. He taught me a lot and I learned a lot and had a lot under my belt. I still appreciate that to this day. My employees did what I asked them to do because I had the management style of compromising, asking them to do something for me and in return doing something of them. If they needed a smoke, I would let them have it, but ask them to bring in the carts from the lot before coming inside and so on. It was a great time! Could get hectic but I loved it!"
good,"Enjoyed working there, friendly workers,traveled to another store helped them open! Boss was real nice dependable!No problems working with co-workers!"
good,The job has many moments of high stress activity and the store budget is sometimes stretched leaving wages a little lower on the spectrum management was always fair respectful and ethical.

good,Not enough money and requirements are little much for a cashier run register stock keep all front cleaned and stocked. End of shift clean from area clean bathrooms and Make sure all customers are satisfied. Definitely needs to pay there cashiers more money or give them less responsibility cause there doing a lot just dealing with people. I only worked little while it was to much and not enough money
good,I use to work at this place called the cabbage patch settlement house. Until I got fired and suspended because I made out with a boy in the staff members bathroom upstairs last year.
good,"its a great place to work, a little crazy at christmas time, but what store isnt, love the local people, alot of the regulars put a smile on your face and makes you happy to help and serve them, my boss was very thorough and clear about job duties which makes every day flow nicely"
good,Great company to work for. Great training and realistic goals set by management. Managers work side by side with employees everyday. The process of starting to work moves quickly and long as you have info ready to give manager.
good,"Days at dollar general are not bad at all, when i go in there is normally a list of tasks at hand for the current shifts members. Once I get that done I will stock shelves and run register until we close."
good,Very good place to work very friendly  good managers and good team workers and if you need a day off you have an opportunity to change days with somone
good,It was pretty fun working there we had fun with each other and everyone was very outgoing and encouraging they helped you when you needed something it was always well stocked in my location
good,"The job and atmosphere is great, but the pay is horrible. The job is meant for high schoolers or people unable to work anywhere else cause of age or disability."
good,I regret ever leaving this company. It’s a great job with plenty of room for advancement. They take care of their employees and will go that extra mile.
good,"what I learned was to become patient with the customers,and collaborative when theres a customer who needs my help. when working as a cashier you have to know the expectations of that position;like a greeter being a greeter is apart of the position because greeting those who enter, it kind of lets the customers know that we care and,that we are polite."
good,"I wasnt there very long to answer this."
good,"DG Stores are very busy - never a dull moment.  If you are bored this place will keep you busy - there is always stock to be moved to the floor, plan-o-grams to reset.  Cleaning and of coarse customers!"
good,"Management was usually pretty easy to work with. Learned the values of working closely as a team to keep the store in running order. The hardest, but most enjoyable part of the job was learning the skills to advance to a leadership position and be entrusted with deposits and conference calls."
good,"the Job can be easy at times however, at dollar general the cashiers do everything . They cash people out , stock and recover which can get stressful if it gets busy ."
good,"Dollar general is a great place to work, has well rounded employees and repesctful customers. The only down side is their pay rate is too low. Other than that I loved it"
good,"A typical day at work here for an assistant consists of working on fright. Managing vendors, Attending to associates needs, and doing as much as you can to maintain a clean and positive work environment. Above all else have exceptional customer service."
good,"The pay was pretty good, but the management team was kind of rude and impatient. He would yell and belittle both customers and employees whenever we made an error or didn't do things according to his methods."
good,Great job great company I love the environment. I clean bathrooms mop stock do front end work and so much more. This company has been good to us and I am hoping to move up
good,My job at Dollar General was beyond enjoyable. I liked what I did on a daily basis there and I only complained when my manager had me doing the job of a lead sales associate and didn't want to give me a pay raise or promotion for doing the work. Other than that I enjoyed my job and had decent benefits.
good,I like working for this company. I knew everyone for years before I started. Great crew to work with. Love my store and the customers are awesome!!!!!
good,Its hard work and requires alot of effort but can work up quickly with the right mind set and work ethic can work to a store manager within a year if you work hard with determination
good,Dollar general is a great place to work. There are great benifits. I have worked at a few different locations and the layout is mostly the same. There have been some changes in setting ad and i feel it works out better.
good,"Interview went great! Relax, smile and be yourself! I really love my job and the people I work with. I really do look forward to going to work and love working with customers"
good,"I enjoyed working there...very good experience...easy work...u get paid every week....and people.friendly...got paid for holidays..."
good,I loved working with my co-workers. My location treated everyone like they were family. I hated leaving my location. Would've stayed if I could have but I moved and it was too far of a drive for me to commute back and forth to work.
good,"Working at dollar general is a great working experience, i liked how  managed we kept the store,how nice is the neighborhood and also my manager how we’ll understanding he was with my arrangement of schedule."
good,Was stressful but what job ain't and was fun being key holder not so fun being cashier was boring.keyholder was fast paced and busy had to get truck done fast.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Dollar General. Both my managers were awesome and I actually still go visit them often. My only complaints are, I didn't get full time hours, and the pay rate isn't enough to live off of."
good,"love meeting new people. like to see the same people come in, good attitude, a nice place to work. I feel safe to work there. I enjoy making people happy."
good,"Stocking shelves, helping customers, working with team members.  and Interesting collection of customers.  "
good,on a typical workday we would just clean and run the register. the management a DG was really nice. at DG I learned to close the register at the end of the day.
good,Very fast paced. Team work is key. Management is good for the most part. Learned all departments of the huge new warehouse. Work hard and you can move up!
good,I loved working at Dollar General. I enjoyed what I did. Personal reasons are why I left or I would still be employed with the company. Have also considered maybe going back sometime.
good,It definitely is hard work taking care of customers while stocking shelves. I kept a clean organized area that made the store more presentable to customers and our associates
good,Being with this company for several years I've experienced interesting customer interactions ranging from great to horrible. Employees are often times underpaid for the physical and mental labor dollar general expects of its employees.
good,A great workplace and an overall good work area people friendly good work space lots of hands on training overall just a great place to work nothing negative about this place of business
good,"Over all I loved working here. The people are amazing to work with, the job is fairly easy if you know what you doing and pay attention during training."
good,I been working for Dollar General since the day they opened October 2018 i really enjoy working there. Just dont like the location where its at. The manager is awesome
good,"Loved working here. My manager was great.  Only down side is I was fired while on maternity leave cuz I was pulled from work a few months before my due date and my legal family leave of 12 weeks was used up.  It was not my manager or dm, but corporate that fired me."
good,Overall good place to work. Wouldn't recommend making it a permanent position for a living unless you're high in management or have another income. But my manager was absolutely amazing.
good,The people i worked with were friendly and easy to work with. The job itself was not that hard and wish the hours had been more and then i would have stayed and not left.
good,I loved working at my local Dollar General. The people that i worked with were awesome. They made sure that i always felt welcome and they would include all in almost everything. My manager was amazing when it came to the store and her employees. I really do miss being there.
good,The job itself is easy and I was promoted to lead sales (management position) within 20 mins of my first shift. The pay sucks though and there are no benefits unless your manager or assistant manager.
good,Always something to do. Hard to cahsier and manage but easy company to work for. Answer calls. Dealing with vendors. Shoplifters and thieves with no protection were hardest parts
good,"FInally had a job that I actually loved. Besides the management that was running the store, I thoroughly enjoyed my job and didn't mind working or learning new things along the way."
good,"my typical day was busy but , fun . how to run the store. management always was good and work with you to help you in any way. I really enjoyed working with everyone . the job really is not hard at all. I enjoyed working there i was able to do job with no problem and I really enjoyed working to help all my customers and most was like family"
good,"A typical day is always entertaining, I can go in from having a bad day but because of the environment I am quickly pulled it and in no time, my day has turned around. I learned a lot about myself, my patience levels have increased. I learned I am capable of much more than I gave myself credit for. I learned more about communicating with and helping out customers. The management is amazing, understanding and very caring. They're fun, yet always professional. It's a joy to work with the people I work with. The hardest part of the job is being on my feet so often, difficult but not impossible. I do it everyday with a smile on my face. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with and meet new people with different backgrounds and attitudes."
good,Dollar General is not a good workplace for one who supports a family alone. Not enough pay nor hours unless directed by the District Manager in which usually you will become a Trouble Shooter and bounce locations to make the hours needed just to pay the bills. Complete hastle to keep up with continuous changing nonfixed schedules. Yearly evaluations which is an awful waiting game for a hard worker. Dollar General is perfect for those who just need some extra income or is in school and need a small paycheck to make it by. Get paid weekly. Hour breaks sometimes 30 min. And don't expect much training they tend to just throw you in and let you figure most of it out on your own. Training on the computer takes forever to complete and needs upgrading some management will train against proper procedure in computer training which can makeale your job harder in the long run. Keeping up with both side work and customers can be nerve wracking at times... Can be a great place to work can be a nightmare....
good,I actually enjoy working there meeting new people. It was jus the manger that I had problem with sometimes. Other then that it was a good job to be at and making a career at.
good,Loved the job and all i worked with till all the unfair treatment started happening after the assistant manager became store manager. But loved the company over all still to be paid for 20hrs
good,This was one of my favorite jobs the people and environment was just great and my boss was my best friend I was just overall happy almost every day I only left bc I needed more money lol.
good,"For a first job ever, it was an amazing part time opportunity. The work is relaxed, not stressful, and fast paced, so the days go by quick. I don't know how it would be full-time, though."
good,"During my time at Dollar General I gain the experience to be a cashier ,I also did stock and inventory and it was an opportunity for me to exercise great customer service skills."
good,Came in everyday worked beside employees. Did not feel like I was above them. Worked as a team.I enjoyed coming to work everyday and being able to support my family and know that the employees felt my friendship.
good,"I loved working at this place, the employees will funds work with and easy to get along with a love to meet new people everyday. Easy to work with tried to give your days off when you"
good,"you stock all products and you also are at the cash register most of the time, sometimes you can do other odd jobs, but mostly stocking the food and toys"
good,"fast paced work , more product than space for store and managers seem to care about your well being personally which was a great thing, never a dull day involving customers and new product coming to the store, they need a better ramp way for the truck delivery it works against you other than that great place."
good,i absolutely love my job at dollar general. All employees work great as a team. We keep store clean and in order like it should be. I enjoy pleasing the customers.
good,"Love my manager and most of my fellow employees. Learned a lot about myself working for a company. Customers can really stress your patience at times, but then you get the sweet ones and it's all worth it."
good,There is always something to do and things to keep you busy. A good job. You will never be bored. Manger was great and always helped me with my hours. No complications.
good,"Very laid back, and nice. Isn't the best pay but for the chillness of the job it is acceptable. It was a lovely job that I would go definitely go back to."

good,Dollar general is a wonderful company to work for.  They have good pay and corporate is easy to deal with.  Promotions come often if you work hard enough
good,"I loved working for Dollar General. I worked my way up the ladder very  quickly and became a store manager in less than two months. Unfortunately, I had to work so many hours and manage so many different stores that I got burnt out. Eighty plus hours a week was just too much!"

good,"Rang up customers and took payment from them."
good,Dollar general is a good company to work for but I am expecting a child so I needed to go somewhere with better pay so I will have the money to buy necessities for my child in the future
good,It was actual a nice place to work. I greatly enjoyed my time working there. All the management was nice and understanding. The only bad thing is watching for shoplifters and fake coupons during busy times or late at night.
good,"the dollar store in rogers, i got a lot done and i got left alone for hour(s) at a time and got customers checked out and got items  put on the shelf's. The manager was rude and disrespectful."
good,I Enjoyed working for the company's brand wile attending there. I learned how to use more & better customer  services. Becoming more mature and patience with working with others that i worked under or broad consumers. One of the hardest parts of the job is working under supervision without any social communication or even having a good day at work. My most enjoyable part of the job is making costumers proud when you are working your hardest and most honest way. although you cant show any emotion wile at work
good,I worked on the assembly line I was basically a sorter I loaded trucks separated the chemicals and food items and make sure that everything gets to the stores in correct form and on time
good,Fast paced environment with no shortage of tasks to accomplish.  With it being a small amount of personnel in each store you learn to depend on one another to help the team move forward.
good,I enjoyed my time at Dollar Genersl great team players flexible schedule management is always there to assust when needed there are great advancement oppertunities within the company
good,"Dollar General is a wonderful place to work. Unfortunately me manager was a huge issue for me. She was very unprofessional, which caused us not to be able to keep keep people employed in our store. I would go back to work for this company in a heart beat."
good,I loved the store and it's customers. Didn't get along with some of the employees. I didn't let it affect my job. I would happily work with the company again.
good,"Having great customer service is a must working here. multi tasking is a necessity here you have to be able to run ya register, un load a truck, putting up stock, and managing your team."
good,"Gives good experience of customer service and working with money. Some days were long when its slow, other times it was short and faced paced. Best part of the job we seeing happy repeat customers come back and being recognized for previous conversations."
good,"i have enjoyed my time working there, i just needed more hours and pay. i received a promotion and 2 raises while being there. the work environment and coworkers were great, i just didn't get paid enough."
good,"Great place to work,  right manager can find you more hours.  Pay really not enough even for a single parent with kids or for the travel if living a distance away"
good,"The customers loved to come to an environment that was clean, stocked, and full of laughs and enjoyment. Making peoples days is what i enjoy the most."
good,This was a great job. I wish that the pay would have been more and I think I might have stayed longer. The work was very easy and most of the time you worked independently.
good,Just needs more promotions and more praise for jobs well done other than that great place to work just a lot to do as far as setting seasonal before the last season is over yet
good,"Working in the Dollar General is a pretty fast-paced environment, with lots to do! I feel I have acquired more knowledge regarding task, and time management. There is never a dull moment in this store, as I was always busy! Externally though, i am impressed by both the managers and co-workers. They are all role models with excellent work ethic!"
good,"I like my co-workers, I have learned how to do many new things, such as planograms and settings for the store. The management is great to work for presently."
good,other than several managers dollar general went through while I was there it was a great place to work. I enjoyed working there the most out of the jobs I've had so far.

good,"Most of your workday is stocking, checking (cash register) and zoning, no matter what position you hold."
good,"I loved working at Dollar General because of the many characters that I met on a daily basis. The costumers are the ones that give you a sense of accomplishment; well some of them do. It is not an easy or lazy job, you are constantly on your toes and moving whether it's running the register or stocking. It's a great job to be in if you are not afraid of hard work and getting things done quickly. The hardest part of my day/ week is when we received the truck and didn't have enough man power to run register and work the truck all in one day."
good,"Wonderful company to be a part of. Company has flexible hours to work with. This company believes in promoting hard work. The start off pay is not so great, but the pay raises are pretty good."
good,Good place to work for someone looking for a part time job good people they try to work with you. The work environment  is good the customers are kind and like to make you feel like your a part of the family.
good,The pay is decent for the type of work but they work you a lot and call you in a lot but don't like to give raises or promotions this is mainly a temporary job
good,"my review is based on my home location. The days off were very flexible as long as you requested before the schedule was made or while it was being made. You weren’t held to so many rules, as most dollar generals have a lot of inappropriate customer behavior. It was a very nice place to work at and if I ever owned my own business like a DG, I know how to do so, it’s basically what you do when you work there, you take care of the store with one other person and go home at the end of the night."
good,The people were friendly and had great attitudes about there job and loved to stay busy. They always kept the shelves stocked and clean for the customers.
good,I worked there for a short while. the company is good and the job is fun. You have a full plate but its not impossible to complete the tasks by deadline unless someone calls off or quits
good,I enjoyed working for Dollar General as a cashier and stocker. I actually liked unloading the packages that came off the truck. I liked my customers and workers.
good,What I loved the most about the job was Sunday mornings when my regular customers would come in before and after church. The hardest and second best day was truck day.
good,"Do your job and everything will be fine. It's really not that hard. Most of the time, you can get the majority of your work for the week done in one day."
good,"It was a fun place to work. I never usually had a problem with customers or other coworkers. I mainly was able to better my time management skills, mathematics skills, and learn the ins and outs of retail. Though the hardest part was being able to keep up with everything. I mainly had trouble balancing all the work I had as well as keeping up with my duties as a cashier."
good,The job site is easy to get to and very good experience .You are learning everyday and wiorking with people and families.I learned how to work a cash register and make change and be polite to the customers.
good,Its a very stressful place to work at with no where near enough employees to make the business grow the stores freight falls behind because hrs are not given to people !
good,Dollar General is a great company and have nice works there. It's all about fast pace and taking care of the products I like it stocking I love it cashier not likely. But yes it's a great company.

good,I typical day at work was using the register and stocking shelves. I learned how to deal with money better. Management was very nice and easy to deal with. The hardest part of the job was rush hour at the register. My favorite part of the job were either the customers or my co workers.
good,It was my favorite job I've ever had! I worked with a ton of great people and it was fairly easy work to do. The hardest thing you'll have to do is reset a plannogram.
good,My manager was awesome. Typical day at work was cashier for 4 to 8 hours. I learned how to prfoessionally  interact with customers. Co workers were the most enjoyable part of the job

good,Managers and employees work place are friendly. Not a stressful job. It's a place where you get to know your customers and a easy to learn work place.

good,"This is a good job for someone my age. The people and the management are nice. The job itself is not too hard. Overall, I'd say that this is also a good job."
good,The work place was a decent experience. You meet all sorts of great people. The culture was for the most part pretty easy going. A typical day of work consisted of helping customers.
good,Fast paced job with the best co-workers and management.  I had a emergency hysterectomy and had to be out longer due to complication after the surgery. I spoke to corporation office and am eligible for rehire. So exited to get back to work.
good,"Set different planograms, changed labels, put out sell tabs on items, supervised the store. Took care of issues or questions customers had. Handled the nightly money drop. Also made sure everything was accounted for an nothing was missing"
good,"just about everything is good about this job at Dollar General. You get to meet new people, help them, stick to the same job everyday and the training is easy."
good,"For the most part, this job was pretty chill. Running the cash register, and stocking on a daily actually could be very fun depending on who you were working with at the time. I loved this job, just didn't get paid enough at the time."
good,"I had a real high respect for the Lead Manager. She was thorough, a great leader, a lot of fun. a bit of a work-aholic. She made it a real enjoyable place to be. An excellent trainer."
good,"I would clock in, either start unloading groceries out of boxes to put on shelves or get on the cash register, then at the end of the day, lock up the store, mop/sweep, and help my manager count down drawer."
good,"I enjoyed working here more than other job i had. The managers were very kind and understanding, which made for a healthy environment. They were aware I had a second job and worked very well with my schedule. Though we go through some obstacles with customers, all of the employees are very upbeat and encouraging every day."
good,I have nothing negative to say about my employment with Dollar General. It was a great learning experience where I was able to be promoted to lead sales Associate

good,I enjoyed working there because it was a fast paced environment. I met a lot of good people and was able to work on my customer service skills. The manager was very helpful.
good,Manager for store is hardworking. Team work is great at my location. Everyone works together and make the job go fast and makes the store look great. I can honestly say I enjoy the staff and store I work at.
good,I really enjoyed working there it is a great place to work I work nights here I just need to work as an lna so I can do my career to you are always busy putting freight away laurel is a great person to work for
good,I would recommend working at Dollar General if you do not become a Manager unless you have plenty of staff.  If you are short one key carrier it makes scheduling and the Managers job completely difficult.
good,"Opened with stocking store, greeted customers, helped find items, gave details on those items, cashier, cleaned the entire store, swept and mopped, and closed the store."
good,"I enjoyed working at the dollar market. I love working with the public."
good,if you desire to grow your ability to multi task this is the place for you. Ability to run every aspect of the store while being in single coverage foe 20+ hour and still able to keep store in order.
good,"Dollar General is a very high paced work environment, however they appreciate the work you do. The management and staff were great coworkers and easy to work with."
good,I was trained by my manager in the cash register was able to learn it all the same day she and every other employee was very helpful with everything. It was a fun job for sure
good,On a typical day at work included taking care of things around the store making sure everything is all tidy up. The working enviroment is always hard working but also having a great time.
good,The only thing i did not like about working there was that the management was very sexist he barley ever hired males and when he did he treated them horribly.
good,"Loved the job. Hate the lies from management. May be different mgmt now. Hope so. Lied about hours changed, lied about which position hired for/advancement. Someone stealing money. Horrible."
good,The hardest part of this job would be dealing with irate customers to get them satisfied. However it was very enjoyable to get to meet different people.
good,"Great environment to work and learn, very polite and great workers to work with.Team always pushing to our goal and never giving up and helping one another."
good,I would recommend dollar general to anyone I know. It was a great place to work. The work place is relaxed but productive. Very good place to shop as well I would say.

good,Working at Dollar General was a good experience for me. I really enjoyed the work that I did for them and I looked forward to every day that I came into work.
good,having a great team is important. They make sure that all store managers are properly trained. Most enjoyable part of the job is assisting customers and seeing the smile on their faces.
good,It depends on how you look at each role one plays out as the leader on duty. For me I always made it fun for the employees while doing are tasks at hand. I always made it safe also and educated each of them on how the outlook of the store could excel. Retail is a messy and can be dangerous place to work depending on location and envirement. Its always good to enjoy and learn your job day at a time things change and so do we.
good,"A typical work day you work the cash register, great customers and restock on free time. Management was great very understanding. The hardest part of the job was working nights. The most enjoyable part of the day was meeting new people."
good,I started out as a part time associate and ended up advancing to lead sales associate.  The culture makes it a nice place to work.  The management changed several times but the assistant manager stayed the same and that gave the store stability.  Every day was a day to learn something new or do something new.
good,"Dollar General was a great work place as there was always something to do. A usual day would be opening the store, taking the bank deposit, then stoking shelves. Customer service is important."
good,"Typical day I would load freight into trailers, either by hand or by a stow jack or pallet jack. Although I would work other departments, I would placed labels on products using an RF device to track the count and inventory. I learned how to stack loads properly, heavy on the bottom and lite on the top and how to pack the load as tightly as possible without damaging product. I learned how to use equipment to load trailers or stage material. Management complemented workers who worked hard or did outstanding work and gave raises as rewards. The company had promotions with rewards such as , paid time off or money to encourage friendly competition between different distribution centers on a yearly basis. The hardest part of the job was that it was physically demanding and very repetitive. Most enjoyable part of the job was working independently at my own pace."
good,"Flexible, productive work environment, fast paced, customer oriented. High turnover due to stressful environment. Managers try to keep overhead low each week so tends to schedule bare minimum staff necessary."
good,I loved the environment. Also it is a great place to start out at as far as starting a career or for a first job. They do offer great benefits and they are great people to be around.
good,I enjoyed my role as assistant manager but the upper management made the culture and job very difficult to navigate. The customers and coworkers were awesome
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and busy. There is constant work to be done between running the register, assisting customers, stocking shelves, and cleaning. It's a tight run ship, which makes it more respectable. I had great management and amazing coworkers at my particular location. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude and/or disrespectful customers. Patience is an asset in any customer service job. The most rewarding parts of being a sales associate are the regular customers that brighten your day, the coworkers that become ""family"", and the satisfaction of hard work knowing you earned something worthwhile."
good,Dollar General was a good place to work. They were very community oriented. They made times for employees and their families to come and celebrate holidays at the job.
good,It was situated to say about this place is keeping up with all the order the order to make sonic the baby with huge the best to make sure enough to say
good,I enjoyed working there I liked my co-workers and management. I quit for medical reasons if not for them I would probably still be there. It is steady pace work as long as u do the work accordingly.
good,"Great place to work, Family oriented company working closely together to make sure anything and everything is done in a timely and speedy time frame.I enjoy working people that give 100% each and every day."
good,Dollar General was a fair and understanding company.  They feel that family comes first.  The company leadership team was easy to talk to and open to new ideas.
good,Very good company to work for has a very nice working environment. Pleasant people to work with you felt safe when working there. The store was always kept clean at all times. Were had colds that would follow us at night to make our nightly deposits for the store
good,customers were my favorite part about working at dollar general the customer were so sweet and caring...had some crazy ones but beautiful delightful people......
good,"Great place to work ! Nice environment,Quiet , friendly and fast paced. Making the DG customers happy and your safety cares about! You won’t regret applying!!"
good,"Dollar General cares about it's employees and strives to be a safe, rewarding environment for everyone. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people,"

good,"This job for me was able to balance my school life and work life and fit a very flexible schedule in. I was a fulltime student working a day job and night job, the manager understood school was important and having finances to pay off and buy what was needed is necessary as well. A typical day at work was checking to make sure no one was trying to steal any merchandise from the store while maintaining and professional tone with the person you are assisting in front of you. The hardest part of the job is trying to be as professional as can be even if it means you have to bight your tongue with some people. Looks like everyone's mother was right, if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it at all. Everyone is listening to what you say and do even if you don't realize it, tis job taught discipline to me in another way I didn't know existed."
good,My typical day at work is loading containers and moving them into the trailer. I learned about workplace safety and how to use and drive warehouse equipment safely. The management gave helpful tips to be successful at your job and would help if the lanes are backed up. Safety is a high priority to the workplace culture. The hardest part of the job is working long shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I'm on top of my job and help my coworkers.
good,I really loved working at dollar general it honestly was my best first sales associate experience ever. I hope to receive more knowledge of this job in the future.

good,"I enjoyed working for this company until my car accident which prevented me from preforming some of the necessary tasks such as the heavy lifting. But it was a great atmosphere. The Flora Store was very clean and organized, with friendly and caring coworkers. My favorite part was knowing that we were going to have productive days and no work place drama. The hardest part about this job was saying goodbye."

good,Company is a great company and is heading in the right direction and making alot of corrections in the right direction. alot of great new implementations being put into play
good,"The manager is good. He works with you on your work hours, You stand a lot and it is hard on your feet. What time you are not helping customers and running a register you are putting out stock or pulling good forward on the shelves to make it easier for the customers to get what they need or want. DG trains you to spot shoplefters and how to deter them from taking things from the store. they also train you for other things that happen. All in all they are a reasonally good place to work."

I learned how to better understand different dialects . I had awesome managers as well as store manager. The hardest job for  me would be stocking high areas because of my height . I most enjoyed the interactions with the different shoppers."

good,I loved working at Dollar General. Great people to work with and just interacting with the customers was great. My schedule was even great the helped me by working around my school schedule.
good,"In all honesty, my time at Dollar General was neither amazing nor horrible.  It kind of sat somewhere in the middle. Shift weren't very long and the job itself wasn't demanding. I would honestly find myself  bored and looking for something more often than not.  I would work with one of two people each night and the nights with my co-worker Sam tended to go a bit faster simply due to us working well together.  Management was very understanding if something came up and would always work with me if I had an issue with scheduling due to me working two jobs at the time."
good,"i really loved the work environment,amazing group work,wish i could have got to stay with dollar general but due to my pregnancy complications i wasnt. im glad i got to experience what it was like to work there,that whats make me want to come back."
good,"Dollar General was one of the best places to work when it came to meeting people. My experience working there was pretty good, but the work load was main put on me because I was the only guy working there. That did not bother me though because my supervisor was pregnant at the time. There was never really anything hard about working there, but when things needed to get done you could not be lazy."
good,I loved working here. I met so many wonderful people and advanced from cashier to management.  I took my job with pride and i loved every second of it.  Dollar general was good to me.
good,"A typical work day for me could go either way depending who my closing manger is for the day. If I was closing with my younger managers we would go about businesses as usual and closer to the time we were about to close we would goof off a bit and joke around with each other. If I close with my older manager it was strictly businesses. I got along with everyone I worked with. My co-workers and I also known when it was ok to be a little silly and when we had to be serious and get things done. Like on truck day, all work and no play. We always got our work done while having fun in the process."
good,Dollar General Distribution is a good job for full time employees. It has great benefits which makes up for the long hours. They are also a very giving company. They give things like glasses and bags to employees just because they can. The office staff and supervisors are very nice and do what they are able to for hard working members.

good,"This is a great first job for anyone. This was my first job and I loved it a lot. Customers and staff were friendly and since this was my local small town Dollar General, I already knew many of the customers on a first name basis. The pay rate is pretty low and there are rarely enough hours for every employee on the payroll to go around. Aside from that, this is a great company."
good,"This job was the best job Ive ever,ever had.The thing that made it so was the staff,our staff.We were more like a family & we were all close.Laughing & having fun while we were working.If I could go back to that particular time in my life.I'd be so happy.Unfortunately we've all went our seperate ways."

good,"Ran register, cleaned, mopped, swept, opened, closed, attend to customers, work freight, stocked and made bank runs."
good,"Most of the time we're very busy, there's many chances to learn all parts of the operation.  The leaders do a good job with the pass along between different shifts so we can be efficient in getting product in and out. Teammates cherish having a balanced schedule. Experience really helps to overcome barriers on the job. It's rewarding to get everything done by the end of the work week."

good,"My first job was very excited that I was beginning to work.  I learned about inventory & stocking, which was not to much different from doing chores at home.  The most enjoyable part for me was earning money for myself and being able to become a young independent young man instead of depending on my Mom."
good,I loved working here but sucked i had to get fired over stupid stuff i wasnt even aware of. but i made lots of friends with my co-workers and all the customers. of course your going to get mean or scary customers but i learned how to blow it off my shoulders and just keep smiling.

good,"My co-workers are usually quiet and to themselves, while doing their work. Everyone is kind of working their rolltainers to meet inventory and productivity goals by the end of the day. I learned how to properly stock merchandise and how to collect inventory from receiving. My manager is firm but fair. I enjoy working this job i just don't receive enough hours to pay the bills. The most enjoyable part of my job is having product knowledge and being able to help customers with their exact needs through this ability."
good,"My typical day at work, was a great one, I would stock shelves in the morning, and later during the day I would ring up customers, that I could help find things throughout the store, and it was generally a great time."
good,"Customer service atmosphere, knowledge of goals to be met and how to make each day better than the last. Great work environment."
good,A typical day at work goes quickly. It depends on if we get shipment or not. If we get shipment I work on stocking shelves along with running the cash register. I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle money better. The management is the best I've seen because my manager is flexible with my schooling hours and my softball schedule. The co-workers always have a smile on their face and are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is getting to know the store and figure out where everything goes. I enjoy being able to greet the customers and help them when they need help.
good,"Its an easy job, with wonderful co-workers. the work load is heavy at times because we are understaffed. but I truly love this job. My only wish is that the pay was higher."

good,I enjoyed meeting new people. I always had fun withe the customers. The managers were always nice and helpful. It was always a wonderful environment to be in. Even when you are in a bad mood they always found a way to get you out of it.
good,"I started as a cashier and slowly began my training to become assistant manager. with the knowledge I brought to this company and the training I received while I was there , I was lead sales associate within a year. within a few months I was 3rd key holder. after that I would open or close the store. I would oversee all cashiers, take care of all customers and get the store ready for next day opening. I loved working with all my co-workers and my management team was great."

good,"The job itself is good. Its always a good crowd of people and you know most of the people from school and your daily life. The co workers were people you could count on. Everyone knew what they had to do and we did it. The Manager is a friend now. He listens and understands what going on in life. If you have a problem, let him know, he do anything in his power to help you out. The hardest thing I had to do was leave that job."
good,"It was a good work environment, with supportive work staff. "
good,Spent most days handling the truck and the remodel of the store. I learned how to understand a planogram. The hardest part is reorganizing the store when it is not up to date. Most enjoyable is that you stayed busy in your job.
good,"I deposited cash for the day, I monitor the safety of the company, I continue to thrive and develop effective verbal and written communication"
good,I get to work usually around a half hour early every day. Then I ask my boss what is to be worked on first and most important job tasks.

Clean breakroom/bathrooms etc. Learned how to figure up money easier, and how to keep count of it thru out the day. Hardest part of my day was when we would get a return. I had such a hard time dealing with returns. The best thing about that job though was the people. I found it to be a warm experience to work with such good people."

good,"very fast pace fun place to work, never a dull moment , lots of hours as a manager, not much of a home and work life balance, but I enjoyed it,"
good,This job unlike most cashier jobs where you have to stay at the register all day allows you to move around the store and stock and keep shelves looking good so you aren't just waiting for your next customer. This job also allows you to help you better your social skills by dealing with difficult situations and customers.

There is always something to do at the DG."

good,I would say the hardest part of working at this job would be working on the cashier. The reason i say is that you would need to learn how to do the checks when somebody write checks or use there card.Also it gets difficult when doing voids and cash drops but overall it is a good place to work but you have to pay attention a lot.

good,My job consists of filling orders in a timely manner while operating a stow jack and headset . I place labels onto boxed product from then which I stack the boxes onto roll containers and deliver to the shipping area when the order is complete.
good,"Everyone is friendly, Great environment to work in. Management is great. Can sometimes be stressful. Quick paced. The hours are reasonable. Assisting customers is the best part"
good,I enjoyed working within the company I started as a cashier and became a assistant manager within the 5 years I worked for the company!  The only downside would be the maternity leave and transition coming back to work. as well as no space for employees who breastfeed. I also think there should be an opportunity for employees to give their side when put in as non-rehires.
good,"I enjoyed this company very much and am thankful they started me on a career path for Facility Maintenance."

good,"Worked for over 10 years at one store. Great place to work with plenty of opportunity for advancement. Overall management from store managers to the district manager is fantastic and are willing to work with you. As a part-time employee, they do not offer very good benefits so full time is definitely the way to go."

good,"You have to sit for a few hours watching company videos and do some exercises on a computer that pertain to your job. The next day they had me training on register. Pretty easy to comprehend. In between register training, they teach you how to read and use the hand helds for stocking. I understood my job after a week."
good,Dollar General is great to work for. Relaxed but also keeps you busy and the customers are wonderful. Truck days are a little stressful but it goes back to the relaxed past afterwards
good,"Best working environments great people , taught me a lot . Managers didn’t mind helping others when needed. Customers where greatly treated. And all employees kept place organized."
good,i did volunteer work. there really wasn't any bad thing about helping out at the store. the only thing i disliked was the manager's attitude. i found her very rude.
good,Loved the staff and the job was easy enough for me. Getting to meet customers was a great thing since I love people. Management needs more help on training and store cleaning.
good,"Things were fast paced but easy. Me and my team got the place looking great! I learned how to count down cigs, ordering items, and deposits and everything to do with the stores money! Saw many faces in my short time there as it was a fast paced job and alot couldn't cut it. Friendly staff. Was well taught and prepared for my position there. U boats and rolltainers were a hard part of the job we would always get behind by truck loads at a time due to a lack of staff. And we had a set amount of stuff to be done in an hour for each rolltainer and juggling multiple jobs that we were not required to do as one single person stuff never seemed to actually get done around the store. Most enjoyable part was just being around people and having an important role. I loved my job as a retail worker and even more so as 3rd key manager!"
good,Needed more time to work and and more flexible time frames but overall good management good pay and easy to with work staff in a great convenient location but couldn't keep empo eyes for to long for one reason or another
good,I loved working here except for the manager was on a power trip and abused her authority really bad. She also made it where I hated my job because she didn't do anything planned it off on us.

good,"A typical day at work at Dollar General from opening till closing is; clock-in and start your duties, and keep an eye on the register till the end of the day then clock-out. What I've learned from working there is people skills and money management. The hardest part of the job would probably keeping the store/isles clean, because you would have costumers not put anything back or leave them in a different isle. The management was nice and they knew that this was my first job, and worked with me. The most fun part of the job is making jokes with your co-workers and manager; just trying to make the time go by faster."
good,I absolutely loved the time that i spent working at Dollar General. The only reason i left is because of the Management at the time. I wish now i would of taken my concerns and problems further up the totem pole..

good,"Wonderful group to work with. Family atmosphere. Very laid back, professional but fun, they get together for team building events, cares about customer experience when visiting the stores"
good,Management makes the difference. I've seen bad reviews of DG and feel lucky time have had the manager I did. He kept up morale and was not shy to do anything he'd ask us to do. He led by example and our store was one of the best in the region. It becomes a matter of pride for the whole team. I was happy to advance from Clerk to Keyholder. My hours were always fair and gave me the time I needed with family while still being able to support them.
good,Great place to work!  Always have something to work on. I enjoyed meeting new people everyday. Management was wonderful to work with. you have an opportunity for advancement.
good,Management was very professional and kept the workplace in a great shape. Work flow was fast paced and everybody was easy to work with. Always had two employees at the store at all times. Management would aid in store recovery or any aid needed throughout the day.
good,"This is one job I loved the most only thing I didn't really like was not being able to advance like I wanted to. I got to see different people all the time and some just made my day a lot more better when it wasn't going good. I loved helping them out and selling stuff to them and telling them to come back and they always did. I liked that management let me do stocking most of the time so I could enjoy a break from the register some and feel like I was needed for something else also. I really wanted to make a career out of this, but I left since I couldn't advance after so many years of trying and now I wish I could go back but having trouble trying to find the right store so I can apply."
good,"So far I really enjoy working at dollar general. The atmosphere is pretty great. All of my coworkers are really good people, honest, kind and helpful. Management is also very kind, knowledgeable and helpful with teaching me how to do my job."
good,"My typical day at work, I have learned a lot about retail man. while at dollar general.I enjoy vendor interaction, customer contact learning what the customer needs are and what makes a better shopping  for them. I have learned all aspects of retail management."
good,alot of work you have to be commited to your job i stayed late came in early and worked on my off days not because i was required but because of the person that  i am and you grow to have a love for oyur fellow employees
good,A typical day at Dollar General was opening or closing store and helping and checking out customer's. I learned how to do the management stuff so that I could get advanced to Lead Key. The culture of the store was nice and calm we all got along. Hardest part of that job of course was unloading truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and keeping the store stocked and clean.
good,dollar general is a nice place to work but not enough hours. your coworkers are nice people and my manger was nice. all in all i would not recommend dollar general for anyone to work because not enough hours they had me work only when they needed me to fill in for someone and that was it after telling me at my interview that i would 3-4 times a week and i only ended up working a few times.
good,"supervising entry-level employees, assisting in the hiring process, overseeing retail operations, and ensuring customer satisfaction it was very fun working for dollar general I really liked it there and easy to learn"
good,"Dollar General is a very fast pace company. I am in management there so I over see the cleanliness of the store. Most of all to make customers happy.I also do the nightly deposits of the store, and refunds & exchanges."
good,Everyone was nice even the higher ups. First company I worked for that had managers that genuinely seemed to care about the people. Truck was the only bad thing but that's because of the companies corporate used
good,Excellent location to enhance customer service skills in addition to organizational skills. Employees are super friendly and are capable of finding any item within the store.
good,Enjoyed working with general dollar general. Good company always room for advancement. Staff was good to work with. Relocation wasnt a good thing stores where not able to work with many employees.
good,I enjoyed working there and would like to work there again. I enjoy workinh with people and the pace there is nice. The company was fair and adequate. There were breaks accordingly and the store was clean.
good,"Trabajo en equipo, aprendi un poco mas sobre el mercado de ventas, la direccion de la empresa estaba a mi cargo por lo cual nunca tuve problemas para realizar los turnos de trabajo, la parte dificil seria la auditoria cada mes, pues las ventas subia y bajaba segun la temporada, el compañerismo de mis empleados. El buen trato de mis superiores"
good,the manager was an amazing person and was down to earth she card about her job and made sure her employees did the job and made sure that it was a safe and fun job to go to.
good,Working in a growing business it was busy an fast pace but under good management you can learn fast an move up fast as well. the diversity in the customers is a challenge yet rewarding at the same time. For the most part the staff is friendly and inviting.
good,I really enjoyed working here throughout the time that I did.  The people were amazing and very cooperative. The store procedures were not hard to follow at all or the layout for the store plans.  Management was great until they were transferred then I pretty well took over running the store but all in all a great place to work.
good,"The store I was hired for, GREAT! The company as a whole, OKAY! I do feel that the employees should be paid more! But the environment is wonderful, if you like working is retail!"
good,"I held a part time position at Dollar General while I was obtaining my college degree in business.  I let my manager know about my degree and that I was a hard worker.  Within three days of my store manager seeing the drive I had to work my hardest, she gave me a promotion.  I feel like the Dollar General I briefly worked for has helped me advance my career in business as well as shown me skills that I have applied in my current job. I would recommend anyone to work for this company, and I appreciate all that I have gained from working here."
good,"the only thing i didnt like about working there was the fact that i had to do alot more than i was getting paid for."
good,"I love my job, always having something to do. Stocking shelves cleaning the store and meeting the people in town. I love how there is always something to do, I need that busy work during the day"
good,Greeting the customers as they walk in and making them smile was an easy part of my job at this place. I enjoy being around people and helping them no matter what.
good,Easy job. Not many coworkers. Lovely customers. Not a very big store so not a lot of people all at once. Management has poor people skills. Can have a life outside workplace.
good,"I have been a store manager with Dollar General for years and I must say this company is great for work/life balance and has amazing promotion potential. I know there will be many reading this thinking I am some sort of company man spouting hyperbole, but I will counter that for every bad review you have read there is always more to it behind the scenes."
good,I recommend working for sucessful companies like these.  I gained very helpful management experience and wish to further develop my skills to be the employee I can become. I love being able to support myself and my children and aging parents.
good,It was a great place and alot of room for growth. Hours were kinda crazy. The management was great and you got proper training. The benefits are absolutely amazing.
good,I learned a lot with this company. They also promote from within first. Nothing to strenuous while putting up freight. Love meeting new people.
good,"I loved working for Dollar General, its a great place. Its very friendly and the staff is fun to be around. Most times you just want to hang out there and talk. The Managers and employees are very helpful and take the time out of there work just to ask to even help you in the store or with your bags. I highly recommend working here its really laid back but everyone meets there quota and gets the job done."
good,I love the work place culture and management The store manager is exceptional and really motivates you on a daily basis. The work place culture is fun and relaxing.
good,"At 13,000 stores and counting, we're growing fast and so can you! With hundreds of positions open every week and plenty of training opportunities, joining Dollar General is just the beginning of your best career yet."
good,"it is a great place to work, just not enough hours ,and dont make enough. i learned communicating is the key and easy to do and basically just do your part ."
good,I had a really good team I worked with and a great manager as we'll.  If it wasn't for transportation issues I would go back there in a heart beat. It was a really fun job.
good,"I really loved working here! I was there from the ground floor, helping put in the shelving and stock the store for the first time and they kept me on as a cashier. It was great work and my team was really awesome!"
good,"Fast paced environment, you have to multi-task run the register and stock product on the shelves. Dollar General is big on the apparence  of the store you must recover"
good,I would go in at 6:00 in the morning on a Saturday and i would put up freight until 2:00 in the afternoon and that would be the best time i had at work the hardest part about me working at dollar general was when i had to work on the register because i had to stand there for a long period of time and that made my back sore and me and my co-workers got along great and we were a team. For three days i went to another Dollar General Store and help them get there store back in shape and i loved doing that.
good,Great retail store to work for. Benefits even for part time employees. Low pay wage though. I would recommend working for the company as long as you can advance.
good,I really loved working at this location and if i could i will do it all over again. They employees was nice and friendly and never seem bothered when you had a question or needed help.
good,Fast paced and rewarding if your are a self motivator. Busy and fast growing company. I loved the employeeys I worked with. I did go through several upper management at times which made it difficult to feel comfortable with them.
good,"Fun place to work, but always busy.  Stocking shelves with new items is interesting . People you work with are friendly and helpful. You join together as a team to get shelves stocked and keep store clean and organized"
good,"always pack with people, very friendly people around. always a good time. everyone got alone on their time at work. everyone always worked together. good manger"
good,Once you got the 7 day workflow down it was easy to work there.. Loved my district manager. They need to train people better and more in depth on the sales productivity
good,i loved working here! my co-workers were fabulous! management was amazing and the customers that came in on a daily basis were equally amazing!
good,I enjoyed greeting and taking care of our customers needs. Working with the other sales associates was very important part of my day.
good,"Dollar General gave me advancement opportunities which I did take advantage of up to, Assistant Manager"
good,We had a very busy day today and got a lot accomplished by working together as a team we all get along and tackle what ever comes our way I really enjoy working with the crew I look forward to coming back tomorrow
good,Dollar General was a fast paced always making changes to keep up with the growing needs of its customers. Dollar general offered many chances for advancement.
good,"A nice place to work with quick advancement."
good,this was a good job. I really liked everyone I worked with and for.  the hardest part of this job was trying to keep  shoplifting from happening'. the best thing was all the people you could help.'
good,"Excellent working environment, along with room for growth and educational opportunities. Company growth in the next few years expected to be great."
good,"A typical day at dollar general would be recovering, taking care of customers, helping co-workers, and handling money I enjoyed it though. I learned that you can not please everyone but it doesn't hurt to try. My management was well but towards the end it started to not go good so therefore I had to quit my manager was not doing her part making my job more stressful to where I was unhappy. I loved all my co-workers they were very well listeners when I would ask them to do something I only had to explain once, the hardest part of my job was truck. I enjoyed having customers the most, yes some were mean but the nice ones made up for the rude ones."
good,I really loved working for them and being part of the fast pace team. I thing the customer is the most favorite part of the job.
good,"I enjoyed my co-workers everyone was friendly and looked out for one another. Management at the time was also great it was just a nice, fun workplace and atmosphere. The only reason I like was due to being robbed the security of the building wasn't so well."
good,I enjoyed working for dollar general. The enviroment was a busy one but a productive one. They also offered advancement within the company.
good,it was a good and productive company to work for got alone with my employees and customers learned a lot .the most part that I like was satisfying  my customers
good,working here was an amazing experience. loved getting to make new friends and wonderful coworkers. management was terrible but anything else was awesome!!
good,is a good place to work as a seasonal worker if you want to make money it fast pace and is fun at times but at the end of the job it suck that the job ends
good,Dollar General overall is a good company to work for. Unfortunately it pay so little that they will hire almost anyone therefore drama pursues and it is not managed all that great.
good,Very busy workplace with very helpful management team and co-workers. Work around others scedules for a easy going workplace. Decent hours and very outgoing people.
good,The management team are all very friendly but they do expect you to work really hard at the end of the day to ensure the job gets done. The customers that come into the store become friends of yours due to them being loyal to your store and they are the nicest individuals you could ever meet.
good,"My typical day of work when opening and closing was making sure the store was neat, shelfs well stocked the cashiers had what they needed and doing there job. Most of all making sure the customers was taken care of in a friendly environment. what I enjoyed was feeling like family when it came to the coworkers and customers even though I have experienced some un-freindly customers I learned how to handle the situations to make them more happier."
good,"I loved this job and I would still be there had I not moved out of state. This was a great job opportunity that I had. Balancing being a single parent and the long hours was a little difficult but I managed. The security was there and advancement opportunity was really good. I could have definitely moved up in the company had I stayed in the state. I loved working for my boss, she was a great person. My favorite part of this job was everything working with customers being able to help people if they needed my help. About the only thing I didn't like very well was the long hours I put in when it was inventory time but I still like it very much."
good,"I really enjoyed working here, co-workers and management was great. Allowed me to work whenever I was home from school and was just a great place."
good,A very steady and secure job if you actually do your work and can be fun at the same time. Make sure you actually do your work though otherwise you will get the shaft with scheduling. You can also work at pretty much any Dollar General in the area if you need more hours any particular week as well
good,"Being in management in this company, you dont just do one thing all day it gets changed which is nice because it keeps you interested."
good,"All employees treated each other like family and were enjoyable all around. Simple job, with need of customer service skills. Handling money is the main focus of my position and handling any concerns the customer may have"
good,"sometimes my shifts were hectic,I enjoyed learning how to inventory,most of my co-workers was a pleasure to work with,my cashiers always ask if needed assistance.I took pride in what I accomplished on my job"
good,"I enjoyed working there, it was fun. I loved all my jobs. I make it fun by creating activities that we can do after the work is dun. maybe giving out surveys to customers to tell us what we can do to improve the experience there."
good,as a past DG employee I was giving the benefit of working for a great company that made me feel like I was at home...everyone I ever worked with on any shift was helpful and fun and sometimes witty but it was a great experience. I miss working for DG.
good,Our team was coworker oriented and very productive. Wonderful communication and dependability. Everyone was helpful to one another. Dollar General was a great learning experience in customer service and goal orientation.
good,The productive in the workplace was great. The management was great and so was the co-worker. Learning the cash register and being on the cash register and stocking the shelves when not busy.
good,"A typical day at the dollar general would be running the caash register, stocking shelves and if you had the time to recover the products on the shelves to where customers could reach them better. I learned at the dollar general how working really is, it is not all fun and games like most people think, you have to actually work you cant be lazy. The management was very good. I liked most of my co-workers but i learnt how to tolerate the ones that didnt like me but i never caused any trouble. I think the hardest part of my job was stocking and recovering the shelves especially the very top shelves because they have to be just right. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers with what they needed no matter what it was. Also, i learned to enjoy to recover the shelves."
good,"I opened,went to the bank to do a bank drop,did the schedule,counted out drawers,waited on customers,love the people,checked in vendors,mail search,pog's,lost prevention and much more"
good,"A typical day at work would include waiting on customer, making bank deposits, doing paper work and checking in vendors."
good,"A typical day at work involved stocking, cleaning, and ringing up customers. I stocked and unloaded pallets. I swept, moped, and sanitized every night."
good,The place it's self was great. I learned a lot there such as customer service and team work. my co-workers were great. there wasn't a hard part about this job just had to relocate
good,"I really enjoyed this employer. Whether is be me driving across country to go help remodel stores for cooperate visits, or being in my home store doing the daily routine tasks. I found it a fun family friendly place to be employed."
good,"Opened and closed store , I was a key holder dropped deposits and picked up bags. Kept the daily totals updated and ran reports. Ran cash register and stocked and cleaned the store."
good,"Its very busy at the Dollar General I work at so I have to keep moving, I like working in the retail business because I get to meet all kinds of people and I am a people person. I have moved up from cashier to Lead in no time, I really enjoy it. I eventually would like to be a manager and II have been told I would make a great manager by customers. A lot of them think I am manager already because I am always working when they see me. The hardest part would be the unruly people or the ones that don't speak much English, sometimes I have to explain things a lot to the ones that don't speak much English though it doesn't  really bothering me because I don't stress over much. I love my coworkers they really great people all different and easy to work with."
good,"I never  had a bad day at work. My co-workers are good to get along with. The Job was very easy to do never had any major problems. I loved every second of it. I always had a smile on my face and made sure I provided good service. I would count my money before my shift, and I would always clean my counter after work. I would say standing on your feet all day is really tough for me because of my back, but if you have the right shoes on your feet it should help."
good,"I loved working at Dollar General! A typical day consisted of meeting new people, being able to help customers with questions and concerns and learning about new product. I learned that Ilike to work with people in person rather then over the phone. Also that I am people person and I enjoy helping others and meeting new people every day. My co-workers were great they helped me with any questions or concerns I had myself and they did their job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry and rude customers, I would just smile and be polite. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and seeing all the product they would get in."
good,"I have the best manger, she is on everyone's side not just one person. She's fair to us all and tries to help in any way she can."
good,"typical work day opening or closing store.helping customers/cashier,stocking,cleaning,etc.im learned how to more active in friendly with customers more hands on.my coworkers where awesome,helpful,hard workers.there really wasn't a hard part about the job for me.what i enjoyed most about the job is the customers in helping,in building relations with them."
good,"My first customer service job, I learned all of the basic of being a cashier and customer service provider."
good,"•I would usually be the night shift manager, so i would come in at 1 PM. First thing would be to speak with day shift manager about anything that may have happened. (theft in store, money shortage, employee problems, and other common things.) Then I would go count all of the money in the store (all cash drawers, safe, petty change) and log everything. Second would be to setup a cashier and relieve the on duty manager. Third task was to direct the night shift employees and job duties and goals for the night, and help carry them out as needed (usually restocking shelves and setting up seasonal displays). This would usually keep us busy until closing time which was 9 PM at which point i would lock the main entrance, and direct stockers to begin cleaning the store, while the cashier and I counted the cash drawer together. Once all money was accounted for and all logs were filled I would run a computer program to see end of day sales and check them with logs and file any discrepancies. Lastly I would walk the store floor to overlook the store and make sure it was fit for the morning shift, and then follow all employees out, set alarm, and lock and secure the building."
good,Great place to work at. The company could of offered more to its employees though.
good,I operate the register and put out merchandise all at the same time.
good,most enjoyable part was getting customers what they needed.
good,I love working with the public. Stocking shelves. Keeping Store neat and clean. Assisting in Sales.  Assisting Customers.
good,My Review on this Job  I love working for this company  .they have a great team there .  I learn a lot by work as I have great customer skills .when everyone works together you have a great behind you but bad thing I can say bout this place was not paying enough
good,I loved working here. everybody got along and worked well as a team to make sure the store was up to the DM standards. nothing was hard about this job
good,"Great management"
good,"I enjoyed working for dollar general,learned how to manage a store an run it on my own. management for the most part was great. co-workers were awesome a fun environment. xhardest part of job was probably all the deadlines all at the same time and not enough time in the day."
good,"An overall great place to work. The managers were all very helpful and friendly, and the store was extremely well-kept."
good,"I enjoyed working for Dollar General and would definitely take another sales associate job if rehired. I had wanted to start working early in the summer to make sure I could work as long as possible, as I am also a student, but was offered a job in July and started in August, which I am still very appreciative of. I only quit in mid-September because my former college major (physical therapy) became more than I could handle with a job. This explains why I only worked here for a short time. I am now studying a different field, which will, incidentally, will allow me to be available for employment."
good,"Dollar General was a great place to work . Their expectations were high but were accomplished by doing your duties in a timely manner and following the company's SOPs and guidelines. And your typical day was paperwork. Not fun, but when done in the proper time slots, it was manageable. Your co-workers were what you made of them, treat them with respect but firmly hold them accountable for their actions. I can honestly say there was no hard part about this job, but if I had to, it would be the constant changing of the stockroom layout. It seemed it was done  on a monthly basis, but it appeared to me was that they got new hires in the top positions of the company and they brought outside ideas. Which is great but, why try to fix something that is not broken. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually going to work, knowing you were going to make someone's day a little better, being a customer or employee. What I learned in managing a store for DG is that you find out what you are made of. Either you grab management by the horns or its going to buck you off."
good,I really enjoy the whole experience that I have had working here.
good,"A typical day at work for me was basically being at the cash register completing transactions. If the store wasn't busy I was unloading trucks, stocking , and recovering the entire store. I learned how to recover properly, receive and check in products from vendors, and multitasking. Managers and co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was not having enough people to help out. The most enjoyable part was helping out a customer and making sure they were satisfied."
good,"Greeting customers, running cash register, Stocking of merchandise on to shelves."
good,"I am a senior human resource supervisor who has over 12 years experience in managing compensation and benefits, employee relations, reviewing and writing policies, training and development, staffing and recruiting, record maintaining, and conflict resoulutions."
good,"You have constant Interaction with the Customers, You build up a strong Customer Base with the Locals."
good,it was a fun place to work. the managers and coworkers were nice and helpful. the hardest part of the job was waiting for the manager to do returns because it required a managers key.
good,Dollar general was great because besides the knowledge and experience you gain you can work your way up.
good,"This job was a valuable learning experience as an young adult, I learned how to interact with different people who have different backgrounds and ethnicities and while helping me understand the true meaning of teamwork."
good,"helping costumers find products. "
good,"If you are an individual that looks forward into beginning a career in customer service/retail, this is a good starter job for you. I started there as an employee, went to college for a year, then returned to Dollar General and was re-hired as Assistant Store Manager. This job is a crash coarse in merchandising, as well as customer service, and you can become a specialist in both within your first month, reason being, there is short staff, because the stores are not very big."
good,aren't willing to work with hours. Schedual you hours that you cant get other things done.
good,i enjoy working in fast pace enviroments so there is no need to stop working
good,"I can honestly say that was one of the best jobs I ever had. The staff, the customers, the management, the community, and everything in between made my experience there a wonderful journey."
good,it is a good place to work people are good to work with  the hardest part of my job is the weather being outside is the most enjoyable part of my job
good,"The hardest part of my job is havig to stock 2 trucks in a hour but I loved a challenge,,the most enjoyable time is just showing  up,,,"
good,"Operating Cash Register, promotions selective selling , customer service"
good,"I learned alot of stuff at dollar general. They really got me ready to work cause this was my first job. They taught me alot of stuff as Inventory for store, Facing, and Register work"
good,My typical day at work was quick fun and fast passted it was full of coustmer service and fun people to work with my team was great and we all worked togthger to get the job done.I really don't have a hard part of the job I enjoyed every part of it
good,"had to open the store or had to close the store, wait on people,"
good,ran cash register and the managemnt was awsome there very friendly
good,I had a lot of fun working with Dollar General. The manager I had made each day worth going there for. She made it so easy on her employees. It was a great learning experience for me as an assistant manager. I liked the idea of taking charge and making sure the daily things needed to be done were done and in a timely manner.
good,I really enjoyed the team that I worked with and the facility. I had to step out for a short time due to family situation and now with every thing in order I am ready to find my career.
good,"As a cashier I would greet customers, help them find any items they're looking to purchase, stock the shelves when it get's less busy."
good,I loved working for Dollar General. My boss was amazing. The customer interaction was great. I am so thankful for the exprience.
good,I would typically work 6-12 hours at this job at minimum wage. I didn't have much experience working with the public and this taught me how to become more social and deal with customers. Which was very good since I ended up becoming a nurse. I started as a clerk at this job and ended up becoming part of the management team. So there are opportunities to advance. I loved my manager and coworkers in fact I still visit and talk to them today. Compared to nursing this was the lowest stress job I have ever had. The main part of the job was working the cash register and unloading stock to the floor. I used to have to help unload the trucks that would come into the store however I think they don't do this anymore. I believe everything comes in on rollers. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with my everyday customers who came in. You got to know them so well. The worst thing about the job was dealing with irate customers which didn't come too often. This job helped me through college. I loved the holiday season when it was so fast paced.
good,"Great place to work, enjoyed it alot, getting to meet people everyday"
good,"I like the company very much, excellent company to work for."
good,"I left this company because I had my child, but I greatly enjoyed it. I was assistant store manager and I handled about everything possible."
good,Dollar General is a great place to work. Good opportunity to move up in  position. If your a good worker youll move up fast.
good,"greet customers, use register, clean floor, keep area clean , sometimes you have to change position with team members and stock also."
good,"Went from being a cashier to a key holder. Management was amazing, always worked with schedules, super friendly co-workers, stress-free enviornment, so enjoyable. Hardest part was stocking. "
good,"Typically at work I'd run a cash register. On occasion i'd work freight from the back room out onto the floor. I also did ""lead"" work which is the manager of all of the cashiers. This includes refunds and working with customers to help them resolve problems."
good,"I would work cashier and put out stock all work shift until the last hour then straighten the shelfs up then count my darwer. I learned to mange other workers, check vendors in and out. My mangers were great friendly and nice. cowokers were friendly got along. My hardest part was trying to manage everything. I enjoyed everything i loved working there."
good,"a day working for dollar general was fun, enjoyable, and seemed to go fast. i was always learning somthing new. The sales team was the best iv ever seen. the hardest part about the job was helping tourist that didnt speek english find items. the best part about working there is all the storys you get to tell about your experiances."
good,"Performed Customer service, cashier and money handling. Also Working the sales floor along with the shipment area."
good,Schedule changes often change. Management wasn't so great to work for. The company practice was misleading more than solid.
good,"A typical day at Dollar General: was always rewarding you never knew what the day would bring, in other words there was never a typical day.I learned a lot,Dollar General was the first Managerial job I had. I learned about cash management,Budgeting hours,making a schedule .Hiring and firing, the hardest part of the job was letting some one go. the most enjoyable part of the job would again I have to say where the costumers."
good,I enjoy working for Dollar General but I am just not getting enough hours.
good,I had fun with this job and i got to interact with multiple people.
good,"I enjoyed working at Dollar General.The hours are long at times,but my fellow associates made for a fun place to work.Good insurance."
good,"This was a very fun workplace, they made sure you done your job right and that the customers were always first. Everyday at work i checked customers out at the register, helped the customers find and locate items in the store, while stocking the shelves, taking out the trash, and making sure that the store and the bathrooms were clean. The managers are strict with they're duty's but they are also fun to be around if you do your job right and not goof off. The hardest part of this job was trying to have things done on time when you was extremely bussy, and my most favorite part of this job was that i got to meet new people everyday and i got to help others."
good,"I help many customers with merchandise throughout the store, stock all the products as they are delivered, I have learned that all customers are not the same . I have exceeded in intake from delivery trucks, cashier work and opening/closing store. My co-workers are friendly and easliy to work with. I do not have a hard part about my job. I am very pleased the I have an employer that I can work happily with."
good,It could be more better for the mangers to have more room to make the store profitable.
good,A great place to work and meet great people I was able to work up into management within 6 months. Lots of room for advancement.
good,i love the custrom there and the worker was awsome. the price was great to.

good,Working at Dollar General was a great learning experience. It introduced me into the business of retail. I never a negative problem my time there at all.
good,"I have to say that I am great with people and so this job was an awesome experience for me. At the time of working for dollar General, it was in my home town, so Iit gave me the oppurtuntiy to get to know everyone in town. I learned to check in trucks and groceries on the computer. I have been a cashier off and on since I was just a young girl so that part was extrememly easy."
good,"I love working with my team. We all work together to get things done. I think it depends on where you work if you would enjoy working. I had a customer ask me if I was always so pleasant. She said I always had a smile on my e. We have customers that are returning customers, which is always nice."

good,There is alot to do in this company you can always look to move up. The company is so willing to help and promote within . The job is pretty easy as long as you are good with the public!
good,Run register after being showed how to do it only once. Page if you need help with anything. Management is mainly nice and helpful. Customer service and alot of demands on individual people.

good,"Typical day at work was stocking, unloadind truck and cashier. I learned a lot about retail. They were very fair and considerate with peoples schedule."
good,"I really loved  my job working at dollar general. The only problem that I had was the store manager was never really available after she left the store. She never worked nights or weekend and sometimes I was left there alone at night by myself with no help and I was in a very high volume store in kennett square pennsylvania. When I had brought this up, my manager cut my hours so bad that I had to find another job and when I did, she submitted to corporate that I just up and quit and I was a non rehirable  employee. I do not think that I was treated fairly in this situation because at the end of the day, if your manager is not available after she leaves the building at 3pm monday thru friday and makes false accusations, she should not be a manager of the store. Customer service it team work from the entire staff, not just certain people."
good,I loved working there. If i could go back i would but since i quit i dont think that is possible. The manager was not so nice bit not all are like that.
good,"As a Dollar General employee there are customers of all cultures coning in throughout the day. A lot of the customers are regulars, so after working there for so long you begin to learn when to expect your usuals to drop by the store.

good,It was a friendly place to work.  The management team was easy to deal with and were always ready to help out.  I would go in stock the shelves and leave.
good,I was a cashier and when I didn’t have any customers I would recover different items on the shelves. By night time I would sweep and mop the front part of the store. Overall it was great working there
good,Opening the store greeting customers and making sure that the tasks are done for the day stocking and helping with projects that have to be done. The job is physically taxing but enjoyable knowing that you have accomplished a good days work

good,"I am currently a store manager for DG and love it. The only down side is the work/life balance. I am at the store more than I am at my home. But overall, I'd prefer to never have another job than the one I do now. My DM is great and I am pretty lucky to have the staff that I do."

good,"Hired as a sales associate and in less then 3 months I was promoted to key holder. "
good,Great place to work. Management is also and so far. Work is not hard but sometimes there is a business rush.

good,"The location I chose to work at had a great team. My manager was a great team leader and took very much pride in her store as well as her employees. I was honored to have had the experience of having such a manger take so much pride, loyalty and put so much hard work into her company; it set an example for myself as to be the same kind of employee in my career."
good,Working here was a great experience. I have worked at two different location and this one was my favorite. The first location was not that great. I would recommend working here. The only reason I left was because I had to move.

good,my career with DG was cut shirt due to needing to relocate after another death in the family.interacting with the customers and learning their needs and wants was fulfilling as a manger. not having what the customer wants is always hard to deal with. meeting new people who are seasonal to the area is always a bonus
good,i like it at dollar general but living 25 miles away adds two hours to my work day. the rate system is highly demanding and creates an unsafe work environment because speed is more important than safety.
good,"My favorite job so far, Moved up within the company quickly, my managers were awesome, fast pace business, a lot of local regular customers that made work easier and enjoyable."
good,Dollar General gave me room to grow as a successful Manager. I enjoyed my time there. I do hope to return there some day. As a manager I was able to create my store and be proud of my store.

good,I enjoyed working for Dollar General. I loved my co-workers and customers alike. Didn't really have any problems with anyone. I only disliked one assistant manager and that was because she was rude and cold with customers and co-workers. I just wish there were more opportunities for advancement.

good,"I enjoy meeting and talking with customers. I was also able to keep a good stock of what my customers wanted based upon my conversations with them. I learned so much while being apart of this company! Leadership such as my district and regional managers have been outstanding when answering any questions and concerns I had. I learned more of expected daily routines, sales, shrink, inventory ...the list goes on! The people I have worked with have for the most part been hard working and dedicated to the team aspect. The hardest part of my job was politely and respectfully dealing with unhappy customers to make things right with them and disciplining staff."
good,Great place to work for. Employees are great and so are the customers. You are always busy no matter what. great pay and hours. I would recommend for sure!
good,Typical day at work would be doing totes or doing plan-o-grams. I  learned how to work well with others. The management was great at the beginning until i requested a transfer and didnt get it. So then i got terminated for no reason. The hardest part of the job would be trying to locate all the items to the right spot once the truck is delivered. And the most enjoyable would be having flexible hours to spend time with family.
good,"Enjoyed working for this diverse company. The employees and managers were very friendly and understanding. After asking for more hours, I was given an opportunity to work at another location for the same company, allowing an increase of hours."

good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for them. I got to know some amazing employees and customers. The hardest part about the job is dealing with unruly customers. The easiest part is probably stocking or running the register. I learned a lot about customer service and management. I highly recommend working for them.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company very much, the staff and customers were very friendly! The management was very helpful with answering questions. I felt very comfortable with the working conditions of this store."
good,"Good starting job. Easy, laid back with always having things to do while working. Only thing your have to worry about is the occasional rude customer."

I had a variety of employees (team members) and we made it fun. the hardest part of the job was leaving it. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the people of the community."
good,"A typical days work was opening thirty minutes to opening hours, and being available when other employees could not make schedule.   I've learned that management of employees occupies 90% of your time.  Management requires lots of patience.  the workplace was of mixed culture.  The hardest part of the job was handling shifts that was assigned to others due to no shows.  the most enjoyable part of the job was the Holidays and the patrons."

good,"I love working at the dollar general due to fast pace environment, multitasking, helping customers, close to home, and advancing my knowledge every day to best serve our customers."
good,My Review of work with this company is every inspiring and you can learn alot in retail if you be experienced. You have to make you customers happy and keep quailty up.
good,The employees and manager were sweet and very kind. They helped settle in and be comfortable in the work. The work area is calm and the hardest part of the job was to deal with unhappy customers and to keep your patience with them. My most enjoyable part of the job was to keep the store cleaned and help out the customers in need.
good,"This company has been going strong for many years.  In my time with this company they opened two new stores in the small town that I was in. Dollar General continues to grow, despite the big box competition."
good,Never trust an employee and make sure they can lock up personal belongings if unable to do so dont bribg anything i had my money stolen by a key holder and nothing they can do about it needless to say left never came back to work instead of goung to jail i walked away
good,"Before Dollar General I had not worked for a retail company in human resources. It the most fast paced job I have ever had, but it also the most fun for many reasons."

good,good place to work not so much hours but it was a very interesting job. the hours where not what id liked but the people there are very friendly an outgoing if it pays better id probably go back.
good,"My typical day at work is not too but busy at the same time. Most of the time, I am using the cash register to checkout customers and assisting them or other customers as well. When I am not at the register I am stocking and recovering items. Near the end of the day I sweep and mop the floors, then throw away trash. There are not too many things to learn at Dollar General but if there is something to learn I am willing to learn about something or a situation. My co-workers are good workers like I am and also easy going. They are also willing to help me if I need help. The hardest part of my job is stocking certain areas of the store like medicines. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people that can help me about advancement and benefits about my job."
good,Your work day was pretty routine. They offered training and rapid advancement. The most enjoyable part of the  job was learning and obtaining new skills.

good,It was a good job and I enjoyed working there . It kept me going and kept me intune with alot of things I am thankful for this job .
good,"Before opening, we would do the banking, get ready for the day.  After opening we got paperwork got done in the morning, we would stock, ordering, receiving of vendors, help at register, help customers if they needed help. I would merchandise product that was on sale or was new. I learned how to do that. You have to make the product talk to you, that was the key. The co-workers got along with each other. sometimes you would get one that just didn't get along or play nice. I think the hardest part of the job was hiring. You tried to find people that would fit in with what you needed. It wasn't always easy. The best part of the job was the customers. Sure you got some that wasn't friendly or happy, but overall most of them were great."
good,"this was my first assistant manager position and I really enjoyed it because I was learning so much. money handling, customer service, loading and unloading trucks, cashier, stocking. working with others and the customer service experience"
good,"This job has given me the opportunity to broaden my costumer services skills and has helped to improve my versatility. I started off as just a cashier and I now stock as well as recover and block the store. I most enjoy my customers though, I must say. The regular customers now know me by name or face and they always greet me enthusiastically when they see me and vice versa."
good,Each day of work is basically scheduled and semi organized by the company for success.  Allows the ability for advancement.
good,Great place to work always busy work with great people love them all. Always a busy store always something to do  Great customers
good,All of my co-workers were friendly and treated fairly. The manager was a sweetheart. The customers were friendly and easy to deal with.
good,"Most days were very fast pasted, as there was only 1 cashier on the job at all time, which was me. I also did inventory and stocking. I had to get a certain amount of work done by the end of the day and I always completed it. If I worked until closed I would clean the store before leaving."
good,"I only worked in one other warehouse before DG and I love both places. being a receiver I learned how to look for details, work with cool people and learned how to make deadlines, without being under pressure. they helped me achieve more than just a check. I honestly loved waking up and going to work at DG."
good,stocking and replenishing the shelves with products and customer service also making sure the store is recovered and cleaned daily
good,"Waiting on customers, stocking shelves. Unloading trucks at 6 am and stocking the shelves makes for a long day to what I remember. "
good,A typical day at Dollar General was counting the drawer to make sure the right amount of gloating cash was there and then assisting customers with their needs as well as cashing them out at the register. I learned how to move the store around and organizational skills as well as a lot of problem solving while working for DG. My coworkers were always easy to be around and always pleasant. The hardest part of my job was pleasing an unhappy customer but that also made it the most enjoyable to see that I could make them happy in the end.
good,The store manager was great.  Always willing to work with scheduling. ( school or dr appointments ect)  The store was clean.  Stock was always put out in time.  Friendly employees.  I hated to see the Manager leave because a death in the family.

good,"Lead Sales Associate similar to an assistant manager."
good,I have nothing negative to say about the Dollar General company because they are a great company to work for. You receive excellent benefits and bonuses. The only reason I am looking for other employment is that I would very much like to use my college degrees.
good,"I would usually open the store and take the deposit to the bank. I loved to stock the store and recover. I was always the perfectionist. I have learned alot of patience with co workers that didn't want to do what i asked them to do. I have been to 13 different stores to help cashier, stock and remodel. You have some good managers, some bad ones, and some that just don't like you because of personal reasons. The hardest part of the job is finding the balance between a manager that doesn't like an employee because they were there first."
good,Dollar General has a great environment and team. I loved the customers and I enjoyed working with great people. There is room for advancement with this company.
good,Had an enjoyable time being a part of the Dollar General team. My boss created an enjoyable atmosphere each day at worked & made me feel that the work & time that I put in was greatly appreciated. It was fairly easy to catch on to simple daily tasks & there was always something that needed to be done; each associate played a part in working together to make the day go by as smooth as possible.
good,"I had great coworkers, all very helpful. They answered any questions I had, and when I was presented with something I didn't know how to do, they showed me step by step how to do it."

good,I have been with this company for over two years now. I enjoy working with the public. I have several regular customers that I look forward to seeing everyday.As welll as the weekly vendors.I work with a great group of fellow employees.
good,"A typical at Dollar General Distribution, you go in talk to your supervisor. He tell how much work it is for today, and you get to work. I learned how to order fill very quickly at Dollar General the management was great. My co-workers was very friendly the hardest part of the job was going to cross train in case pack. The most Enjoyable part of the day was getting to leave on lunch break and when the work is done you can go home."
good,I went to Dollar General at least 3 times a week before i started working there. I love my customers and my coworkers. They were great about my pregnancy and maternity leave. I feel like my coworkers are my second family.
good,Lots of work needed. Fast paced. Need to be relaxed and calm with this job. Lots of advancement in this job. Can be enjoyable with a can-do attitude.
good,Everyday was enjoyable.  Did not experience any micro-management.  Was trained on the job and left to manage my own time.  Everyone was friendly and the environment was the least stressful I have ever experienced.  Dollar General Corporate Office is a shining example of how a family oriented company should be ran.
good,"Training appropriate employees was always my number one goal.  Informed and properly trained employees allowed the work load to be dispersed productively.  Allowing team members to know they are needed in control of shrink, sales, and overall increase of store brought purpose to each employee, causing a desire to grow and learn more.  "
good,"a regular day at work would consist of me stayin on my feet and being productive."
good,"Was giving a lot of hours during the week. The pay could have been a little better for the job. I like the way I got paid, I also like the idea that we were giving an opportunity for 401 K benefits after a certain time frame. I enjoy the people that I worked for. The only thing that I had problems with is that, the customers who thought they could come and steal things that they should have paid for."
good,"-Busy "
good,I clock in and start working on the freight. When the Truck comes I help Unload the truck and put the empty pallets back on the truck in a timely manner.
good,"I love working for Dollar General because you are always doing something different. I have learned how to set plan-o-grams for different seasons and new products. My co-workers are great and love the people I work with. I believe the hardest part is near closing time when I have to go around and make sure products are in place, floors are clean, and all areas are free of clutter. My managers are great, they work with you with your schedule and will help when you don't understand something. I really don't have anything negative to say about working here. I am looking for a second job to survive with the finances of life."
good,It was a great workplace but I feel that the pay and no benefits did not make it worth working there consistently.
good,"Fast Paced, High Volume Business with Friendly Repeat Customers Who Depend On Great Customer Service."
good,"every one that I worked with was easy to get along with. Never any complaints from customers about my help or personality. There was not a hard part about the job. If you had a question about any thing at work, all you had to do is ask a co-worker. It's a great place to work."
good,Dollar General was good because I liked being on day shift. I love working around people and helping people.

good,I enjoyed having authority and being able to make management decisions. I enjoyed building relationships with the customers and staying busy.
good,"All days were great,loved being there ,and loved my co-workers,and my managers."
good,"Busy days  "
good,"Most days were extremely busy which is great. You had to stock and greet customers, cash customers out. Only thing that was bad here you were the only cashier and you had to stock and try to watch the front at the same time. Makes it hard to stock while you are watching front."
good,Co-workers were like family to me. I was extremely comfortable working in Dollar General
good,"I always get to Dollar General about a hour early everyday I work. I love to get there to get a early focus on my day. Look at the billboard to remind myself of the recovery, the regulations and rules, and how my process on the register was the time before. After, I go and try find my manger.  I ask if she can give me pointer of how I can improve my performance before I hit the clock. From the time I clock in I find my mind in what I call my ""work zone"". What's more important that day is getting my job done and how I can help my store mangers better the store. What makes my day is seeing warm smile from the customers and give one back. I welcome them and ask if they need assist at the time. I have my own register and ring customers out, bagging their merchandise, and always welcome them back. Between ringing customers I stock the front of the store or recovery by taking things back to the proper places or fix items on the shelves to make look good. If I don't have nothing else to do or finish everything my manger of me I started sweeping the front of the store, empty the trash or even start cleaning the bathrooms.My best at my job is how I can make the store look as if I want my home to look. What I can do to make it look and feel like I would at my home. Warm, welcome, and pleased."
good,"Dollar General is one of the best companies I have worked for. They believe in a positive, motivational work environment. Team work is top of their list. They are always trying to better themselves, and make sure the employees have the training they need to succeed. Right now they are all about balancing family and work. They want their employees to have a healthy family life."
good,"A typical day started with clocking in,opening register drawer,checking out customers,doing stock in between,and closing at night. Management was amazing an always willing to help when needed."
good,"Not one day is the same"
good,"I ran cash register, restocked shelves, opened and closed store."
good,"The Dollar General was my first job, and I was welcomed with open arms.  Marci and my other managers were very helpful and gave me more experienced tasks because they knew my capabilities.  I enjoyed the social interactions and the relationships that were made with repeat customers. We had a really strong team, and everyone knew their place and did a good job at it.  I am very pleased to have Marci and the Dollar General team as references for my later goals in life."
good,"Typical Day at work. I mainly close the store with a cashier assigned to that night. It is rare for me to open the store. My day usually starts around anywhere from 1-4pm and does not end until 10:15pm. Start with breaking down rolltainers, totes, and uboats. Do that until 7pm, then I start recovering the entire store, bringing items to the front of the shelf and doing the safety, and cooler checks. By 8pm I am finished and start cigarette count, run tobacco report, finish. Takes about 15-20 minutes. I then give my cashier their lunch break, if they have yet to receive one, if they have, I sweep the sidewalks and parking lot. At 9pm, I pull my till, count it down, balance and run my reports for the day. I set the top safe, pull all of the cash pickups all the cashiers had dropped during the day. I pull out the change fund and count it and verify that it is at what it should be. I start making the deposit and getting it ready for when we close at 10pm.

This is a job if you are fond of retail that I would gladly recommend, the days can often be on and off and sometimes it might feel overwhelming but in the end it certainly offered it fair share of enjoyments. The only downside is the fact it retail means after December the hours tend to plummet and you can often go from working 40 hours or more a week to less than 20; and something that one should keep themselves aware of."

good,"Everyone that works their are very friendly and very understanding, I'd Rec command anyone and everyone that I know to work there or try it out! Their are the good days and bad days but that how it is at any work place. The manager and assistant manager are the best trainers and people I've met.

good,Was a fast paced multi-tasking job.But a very calm and relaxing atmosphere.Everyone was always really friendly and patient.The co-workers as well as the managers always got along and no one ever talked badly about each other or caused any type of drama with one another.

good,being able to satisfy the customer needs and being able to be the person that you are chosen to be is a blessing keeping the store organize and making sure my workers have everything they need to have store running in a smoothly manner.I enjoy helping people and practicing self points but most of all I thank God for the opportunity to learn
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers. Corporate is what is making me hate my job there. Keeps taking our store hours away from us and having us continue work even though corporate says we are supposed to be closed thus taking hours from the employees thus making it hard to even be able to make a little bit of a living off of the job for the time meaning. Co-workers are amazing and are fun to work with.
good,"Great place"

good,It was a great company to work for. The management position was a little difficult at times but it taught me a lot. The workplace at Dollar General was very busy at times because of all the merchandise we had coming off the truck.
good,"It's has is peak hours which is very fast paced but more than anything when it slows down you just find something to do sweep, mop, and rotate the shelves."
good,"I enjoyed my work for general dollar as well as the coustomers and mang and working with fellow employees.Its was always an enjoyable day no matter what was going on and days ended on a good note.It kept you busy but you always had a few to spare to talk with or help a coutomer and you always felt good about your job.A over all great place to work,and I try to incourage others to give general dollar a try.I hope to work for them again."

good,Wonderful coworkers and room to expand your career. Thorough training and excellent pay and benefits. Opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest people.
good,You got paid every week. Small staff. Large truck.with not much help. Inventory cycles every week. Associate discount is 20%. Schedules vary. Best part was that I quit.
good,I liked this job because I like working with the public in general. I did a lot of customer service and that made me happy to make other people happy.
good,Worked at Dollar general for 3yrs it was a hard job at time but it basically was to keep food on the table not a long term job at all but you can make some okay money.
good,I really enjoyed working for Dollar General. If I was given another opportunity I would definitely work there again. It was such honor being about to work and meet new people at the same time.

good,The Company is very understanding of emergency situations and cares about their employees and is always fast paced and has a ladder to climb for new positions with the company.
good,manager was fun loving and bubbly she was very helpful during my learning process very informative the hardest part is learning to time manage properly
good,I was stocking shelves along with operating the cash register. We would be responsible for our register. I would clean up around the registers and infront of the doors when down time
good,the most enjoyable part about working at dollar general is helping customers.getting to know my regular customers.doing my job as a cashier.makeing sure products are not expired.clean and neatly put on the shelf where that product belongs.i learned that you have to have self control.and patience with some customers example;when you have to ask for there i.d. when there buying a beer product or cigarettes sometimes I lose a sale for that reason.but iam also doing my job.
good,Absolutely a great place to work!  I love my work family! I'm close to them than most. Manage r is easy to work with as is everyone else! Pay is ok.. they do offer benefits if full time
good,It was a blast to work at the dollar general as all the employees got along great with each other and the customers were such a joy to see every time they entered the store. Although the store changed managers numerous times during my employment I didn't have a problem with the management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the occasional unruly customer. The most enjoyable part was when I was advanced to Key holder and the more freedom that provided to me instead of standing behind a register every day.
good,"A typical day can be pretty predictable. The management is laid back, you'll feel at ease your first couple of weeks knowing that they will be understanding of your situation. As long as you're not full of yourself and resistant to provide good customer service. You'll last and enjoy a steady amount of cash every week."

good,"I loved working here. I worked the cashier, sometimes we got extremely backed up and it would make it a little hectic on me. I had a lot of friends that worked there with me. The manager was very lean-ant with people he shouldn't have been with. I would say the hardest part of the job was closing, and it wasn't the duties, it was because everyone was constantly still trying to come in. I learned how to be very patient with people working the cash register for hours at a time. I learned AT the Dollar General that it doesn't matter if I'm having a bad day I need to smile and be happy because it doesn't matter what's going on at home, THAT was work!"

Entered payroll data, called in nightly sales, assisted customers with their needs. A fun environment to work in, was able to be creative for merchandising   products to draw customers in store.

good,a typical day at work. i opened the store and welcomed the customers      i was the manager. i learned how open i am and how hard the responsibility's are running a store and making sure things are right and the employees are doing there job. the store always stayed clean and always had stuff decorated when the holidays came. my favorite about that job was seeing all the people coming into the store and having a smile on there faces. i always new how to turn there frowns upside down. i loved the customers out of it all. the hardest part was getting the truck unloaded. we had to have it done in a certain time. we would getin trouble if the job wasnt done.

It gives you very good experience with money counting and stocking shelve, remembering where you need to put things and where everything goes in case a customer asks you where to find a certain item that they are looking for. The hardest part of the job was going in and trying to be nice to certain people who you know wouldn't give you an easy time but you learn to avoid any certain person and just think about your job and how much you need it at the time. Enjoyable parts of the job is always seeing your customers happy."
