rating,review
bad,"It has a small office in banaglore , 200 people working approximately.. too much of politics no trainingâ€™s no growth, work culture is not good, no flexibility"
bad,"No one has ever said ""I'm so glad I worked at Nasdaq.""  This company will destroy your career and your reputation.  A typical day is spent staring at your computer and having zero human interaction.  There is a hacker culture here, so if you aren't one of those childish mask-wearing Anonymous people, you won't fit in.  They have no business or social sense.  Having your work sabotaged by a coworker is considered weak and is your own fault (even if you aren't a programmer).  This company has an expiration date.  I can't wait to outlive it."
bad,NASDAQ is not a good place to work.  I do not recommend pursuing a job at NASDAQ.  Management is very poor and there is very little room for growth and advancement.
bad,"Nasdaq does not hire a lot ... they will backfill positions vacated by previous employees."
bad,"If the name didn't mean anything this would be a worthless company to work for, as that's the only thing good about it, the name Nasdaq on your resume. Two words: Personnel Grinder. It doesn't matter one lick about what you know, it's all about who you know. If you find yourself with a new manager who is advancing their own team agenda and you don't fit, you'll be signing up for unemployment. What a terrible company, management is *awful*"
bad,"This is a small unorganized firm and many people that work here are miserable but paid well so they stay.  I do not understand how a firm that runs this poorly is responsible for such huge trading volume and stock volume.  One hand does not know what the other is doing and the management is awful, most just care about the 9-5 and pay"
bad,"It was refreshing to see the new CEO join who started as an intern.  But unfortunately everybody else underneath her acts fearful of losing their jobs and results in them demonstrating older behaviors that don't engage teams."
bad,"Managers with personal goals get their way because of the poor HR management. There is a lot of racism that is being exploited and  loop holes are being used to maneuver around. The politics at this company is heavy. It's a very pressured environment. There can be some good experiences, but they're very small compared to cons. It's a great to have the Nasdaq on your resume, however expect to have a rough time there if you colored."
bad,"The company was not the best experience that I had in my career. I thought as a whole the company was okay. However, within my department there were some issues that I didn't particularly like and when I addressed them was turned away. I would have stay longer but management was not good. You know what they say people leave there managers not the job."
bad,"Great benefits - 6% 401k match, and they have nice elements like paid time for volunteering (2 days each year). That said, what management is saying about the culture and what is the reality of the culture are polar opposites. "
bad,"I likes the company in the beginning because all the employees wanted to do the best job and help each other.  Then they hires new bosses who were out for themselves and did not even care about the company.  So the employees to save their job took on the attitude of the bosses.  from there is was down hill.  I left the company and later those bosses where let go, damage done.,"
bad,Upper management change processed consistently.  Company has gone downhill for past few years.  Culture has shifted and they do not seem as organized.
bad,"The work was interesting and challenging, but the management was old guard and clueless. There is no job security and will get rid of an employee at a whim. HR is there to represent management only."
bad,"Unprofessional work environment, Typical day was spent cold calling and emailing. Micromanaged."
bad,"Long hours with a management that doesnt seem to care how overloaded the analysts are. Its a very political environment that is very slow to promote. They also have no concept of on-boarding or  any form of training. "
bad,"There is no goal or big picture. Day to day micro managing out of control."
good,"The Times Square office is an unusual environment.  It is run by a Mean Girls event staff and an endless parade of VPs that empower them. Since the workspace is shared by CNBC, employees are sometimes made to be props at their desks.  Since it is also a rental place for events, sometimes you cannot do your work without retreating elsewhere. "
good,"A typical day at work requires answering many emails, reconciling accounts and resolving client issues, then calling clients. "
good,poor senior management and lack of development/growth opportunities.
good,Not a friendly office environment. Would not recommend a friend working here under the current conditions. Exploitative and not recognized or rewarded for achievement.
good,A good workplace typically sometimes feels good and somedays long. Working for more than 3 years with no such good benefits in work related. But due to some circumstances am been to be here.
good,"they get their pound of flesh from you, culture is not right for most people, a lot of turn over. Senior management in it for themselves."
good,"Interesting work, found some colleagues to be intelligent and hardworking. Limited work life balance and concerns over downsizing. Decent benefits and compensation."
good,"They unexpectedly closed the entire office. I was introduced to a really unique platform.  It is one of the harder financial software programs that I have seen, but after investing a few hours on it, it has turned into my favorite financial software that I have used,  The best part of the job was being able to do a successful demonstration via Webex of the platform.  Also had the opportunity to introduce both Separately Managed Accounts and Unified Managed Accounts (SMAs and UMAs)."
good,Not much career development. Can be boring. That is pretty much all that i want to share. thanks
good,"The office is beautiful. There's a pool table and free food in the cafeteria everyday.They go all out for appearances. But the work environment is isolating . It's easy money if you're allowed the opportunity to do your job. There are a couple of managers that are over 40 yet remain with the high school mentality. They live by the typical female, jealousy rule everyday. If you're a typical. ice cold female you'll fit right in."
good,Gave employees chances to learn about Stock Market as they are a competitor of NYSE. Systems were a bit outdated and needed a refresh to stay competitive
good,An interesting job position that required quick decision making and quick and efficient communication with management and peers. Challenging environment that requires adaptability to change on a daily basis.
good,Nasdaq was a wonderful place to grow and advance in my career. The opportunities I had there were amazing. But it is fast paced and extremely stressful. There are way too many meetings during the day so working after hours is a requirement.
good,"Nasdaq has mostly talented people to work with. They are transitioning to a FinTech company without the style (think Facebook, Atlassian, etc) and have a very lean policy (1 person for the job of 2)."
good,Substantial turnover in sales and sales management.  Regional sales managers are stuck in monthly sales forecasting routines and have very little strategic focus within specific territories.  It's all a numbers game to them...hit the monthly figure and do it again.  Don't and you're forced out the door.
good,"Nasdaq runs a profitable business by limiting costs and buying assets. There will always be accolades to firms that do this successfully, but when you define yourself as a tech company, this will not help you grow. Nasdaq is run by prestigious, yet older, executives that do not understand the young and changing landscape of modern technology and growth. There is a clear disconnect between the top and bottom and what it takes to run these units profitably."
good,"I enjoyed a lot. I loved my role there as a fix qa analyst. basically, my project was migration from ISE to NASDAQ Option Trading System.  But time was limited so, we had to test a lot of test cases."
good,"A leader in the industry, they continue to add new solutions for their customers and compete very well with their competition. Most of this organization works well with eachother."
good,"I did enjoy working here. If you work in the finance area be prepared for slow job advancement, rarely receiving raises and being overlooked for all of your accomplishments as a group."
good,The company is growing both in size and in its technological capabilities. This is a very high profile firm and a leader in its space. Very dedicated intelligent work force.
good,"A typical day at NASDAQ was like most full life cycle sales jobs.  Make calls, send emails, do presentations and close business.  I learned a great deal about how a Board of Directors functions.  The need for technology in the space and how many industries have boards that they reports to."
good,"I have gained an invaluable amount knowledge and experience in the National Market System while working at Nasdaq.  Nasdaq clearly illustrates what they expect out of their employees.  I love my fellow analysts, manager, director and Chief Regulatory Officer like family members, we are a great working group and support each other for the benefit of our department."
good,"Once all the equipment was installed, there is a lot of down time and it can get pretty boring, non-stressful is nice, but I like a challenge and I like to keep learning new software and things."
good,"Work days may vary. Sometimes 40 hrs per week. However, it is possible to work more depending on group and various projects."
good,"Good group of folks on the talent acquisition team."
good,"good working environment"
good,Not a bad place to work. Work life balance is better than most and the compensation is good with opportunities to transfer within the company.
good,"Great company, not so great work life/balance. The money is great, the top level management is great, the middle management needs works. Overall, if you like making money but sacrificing time, go for it."
good,"Great place to work except in HR.  Worst run HR department you could ever work for.  Clients are great overall, benefits are good, and compensation can be very good.  Forget about work life balance though.  if you thrive in super chaotic environments and want great, intelligent work, it's fantastic.  great work, terrible leaders in HR.  Other leaders throughout the organization are quite good especially at the Executive level. Good vision, and such smart people."
good,Nasdaq was a great place to work and I was able to excel. The overall culture was a bit oppressive and hindered professional growth. I enjoyed my time there otherwise.
good,"Management is old school and serious type, so no fun really."
good,Great company to work for; many challenging initiatives; high paced ever changing environment. Frequent strategic changes require one to be very flexible and adoptive.
good,"Opportunity to learn about the financial markets, the role of the participants while working for an established technology company.  However, certain groups do not offer a stimulating experience, more of a quasi government slow moving organization which is beholden to the regulators and members."
good,"Nasdaq gives opportunities to the younger generation, they help groom and educate employees on the industry. They allow movement across departments and provide a wide array of material to be educated on."
good,"While completing 2nd QAs for this company, learned about websites and determining when to call the developer's attention to something that may not be working as expected"
good,nice office and good people enjoyed my time and learn a lot nice managers.  busy environment  but supportive people workplace culture is casual but professional.
good,"Oversee the Global Infrastructure for Nasdaq."
good,"The environment and co-workers were great."
good,"NASDAQ is an ok place to work at, I work in a department that's very important, but they have a lot of employees here are not worth the money they are getting paid.  Its like they don't know how to work the position they are in. Most need training and some do not need to be in that position."
good,Nasdaq is a great place to work. If you get into the right area there is plenty of room for growth and advancement. I enjoyed working with my team everyday. We worked long hours but it didn't seem like it because we were getting it all done as a team!
good,"Fanatical about expense management."
good,je m'occupais de l'ouverture de la boutique chaque matin a 8 heure  et de l'installation des articles sur des mannequins.en soirÃ©e je faisais des comptes et l'Ã©ventaire avant la fermeture vu que j'avais un employÃ©
good,Absolutely loved this job.  Worked in various departments until I was laid off.  Working in the Quality Assurance department as a Senior Administrative Assistant being admin to 54 personnel and several key senior management personnel.
good,"Ok place to be. The company i was under was aquired at the time and this seemed to be a smooth transition. No complaints. My manager at the time was a little crazy, but made things interesting. Good product and decent people."
good,NASDAQ will check the box for most of the desired qualities that applicants look for in a new employer. The only downside would be career advancement. Depending on the function and segment of the business promotions may be limited.
good,Learned many skills while working there.  Corporate culture was unattractive.  Very nice benefits with stock options and paid leave.  Could be a lot of fun...nice balance of slow pace and high energy.
good,"Good job environment, satisfied fringe benefits, Great Management, better work/life balance, employee involvement is accepted at any decision making process."
good,"No review No Review No review"
good,"Fun work environment. However, there is marginal room for upward growth. Many staff members are overworked. Management typically has their employees best interests in mind."
good,"Busy and unpredictable days, great opportunity to learn about stock market regulatory requirements and responsibilities, very dedicated and professional co-workers,"
good,"Large number of clients and rapidly growing. SMARTS Brokers has well cemented team. Sometimes work looks slow, but still able to cover hundreds of subscriptions."
good,Friendely environment. Had a great time with team mates with group of 10 people.
good,"Working in one of the fastest-paced Financial Marketplaces in the world is no place for the average 9-to-5'er. To succeed in this environment, you need to be a self-starter, stay cool under what can be extreme pressure, and be a firm believer in the days ends whenever it ends."
good,"Assist with managing team, daily schedules and assignments, meeting, staff meeting etc. Managed database, new hires and client schedules. Scheduled meetings and training's."
good,"Lot of opportunities to learn and grow."
good,"Checking Client Request"
good,"Innovative and good example of Scandinavian management"
good,Good opportunities to improve your career.
good,"My typical day is unpredictable, since many events happen everyday. I learned that my time management has improved drastically since I have been working with live productions. We are a small group, so we work very closely with management. My co-workers and I are a very tight group of 4 guys that run a very big operation. The hardest part of my job is my commute because I live far away. I enjoy the everyday challenges of the live production environment."
good,"Management should take care of employees in terms of better appraisal and opportunities.Also depends on project and manager you get,..you also have work from home option and office is at heart of city."
good,A typical day at work begins with me logging into my machine and reviewing my email for any potential system issue or system outages that require my attention. We also have a ping pong table where my colleagues and I play games when there is downtime.
good,"I worked at this company during their growth period, so I was able to grow with them. I was promoted a number of times during my 10 years with them, and I learned a great deal, and made lots of great friends."
good,The company is great but the advisory business is very niche and does not show room for growth. Coworkers are nice but anybody very smart moves on into better areas. Great perks as a Nasdaq employee and great benefits
good,It is the greatest technology company selling stock exchange products. The people working there and the managers are so helpful. The most enjoyable part of the company is the coffies provided
good,Nasdaq is the bast place to work with lot of flexibility. The culture of the company is good and the managers are great. You will get recognized easily if you do some good work.

good,"Nasdaq is a great company to work for, it was close to home, the job is stressful at times but supervisors and co-workers were willing to assist and the hours were flexible."
good,"Friendly environment, Sometimes Stressful Testing, and live testing scenarios. Easy and casual workplace, Early online Trading, exciting to work for a World Leader in Trading to this day."
good,"This job is great to build relationships with clients, and provide the service they are looking for with webcasting."
good,"A lot of my friends tend to wake up, shower, and go straight to work. And they often complain about having no time to do anything. I find that if I can get those 3 hours in the morning, I have a more productive and peaceful workday. I can sure tell the difference when I don't."
good,"NASDAQ is truly a great place to work. They also offer opportunity for growth, an overall empower you to be great. You receive endless training to ensure you are current on all updates, and new products."

good,State of the art technology; a wonderful group of professionals to work with. We did some great work at Nasdaq!
good,job was fast paced and rewarding. My day would start off by entering IPO's and symbol changes to the system prior to market open. I would then work in a helpdesk-like way taking calls from broker/dealers...answering questions ranging from how to enter a particular kind of trade to researching problem trades. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowing I had helped a broker resolve a problem. Closing markets and helping engineers de-bug new software was also very exciting and rewarding.

good,"Nasdaq is a great company that is constantly growing. The Corporate Solutions division is somewhat separate from the fin-tech side of Nasdaq, but it is still a good starting spot nonetheless. The benefits/compensation are competitive and its a great way to gain a deeper understanding of the markets."

Preparing talent and C level executives to go live on television to ""ring the bell"" at the Nasdaq Stock Market"" was an exciting part of each day.
