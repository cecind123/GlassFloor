bad,Worst place to work management it's terrible they have their favorites and they only bring in people they know from NFI not a recommended place to wor
bad,No work/life balance. Lots of sudden demand for OT and yet times can really slow down where there is no work. No advancement opportunities unless your in the “managers circle”. No communication and they give you the run around in order not to lose you but never give you a straight answer. They’re all over the place when it comes to company and employee needs. Not the best place to work but OT can pay off.
bad,"Alot of times the shoes come in falling apart! Have to send so much back bc they have to be fixed! Too expensive for what you get.Good luck if you are the manager with permission to override and make people happy, give them their discount they left in the car or share between customers at their request, I mean you are told to ""say yes"".. But you will get fired! fotweawarningwarningwarning!i!you"
bad,Not a good long term job management sucks and dont know nothing on how to run the job pay sucks for how much the company makes there greedy and only think about themselves and dont care about there employees
bad,"Very cliquish. Not a fair work environment. Very little to no training. (You're told to train yourself.) Lot's of favoritism and nepotism. If you stand up for yourself, then you are a troublemaker. Pay increases seem to only go to the favored people as do promotions. Have never felt so used or deflated by a job before."
bad,"Collector II contacts customers who are delinquent in the repayment of their loans and obtains payments, commitment agreements or establishes a repayment plan. Followed set policies and procedures when determining suitable collection solution. Typically requires 1-3 years of related experience. Works under moderate supervision. Reviewed and monitored delinquent accounts daily and maintained losses at or below established guidelines."
bad,This by far was the worst company I have ever worked for. District Managers say one thing when they come visit and turn around and say something different. Working towards sales goals like how many rewards you get and for accessories. Those were always the worst ever because people would get turned against one another and then the team your were working with would not trust each other.
bad,"Working at Famous Footwear was fun and exciting only my first day. All the other days that followed were annoying and aggravating. The managers are not as understanding as they look. They like to talk about people behind there backs. They are also rude (rolls eyes, huffs and puffs) and get annoyed everytime you ask a question. Also, they don't hold back when yelling at you for a mistake infront of the customers. My co-workers were the only good thing about this job, plus the 30% off of shoes. The things I hated about this job is that there is no hours (I went 2 weeks without working), the store is slow (not a lot of people come in) and we have no security. They expect us to do our jobs and also be security. This job is boring, all you do is fix boxes and walk around when its slow (which is all the time). Time goes by slow when working here. DON'T WORK HERE! IT'S NOT WORTH IT. WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY. THANK GOD I QUIT!!!!!"
bad,This company does'nt care about there employees make u open the store alone. And receive shipment by your self at 6am in the morning.
bad,"If for some reason you're the kind to enjoy frequent layoffs, dept shuffling/cuts, ever increasing workloads due to the latter, constant reprimanding/finger pointing, and little to no growth potential, then this is your place. This is a company obviously driven just to appease the shareholders. I've watched while every year like clockwork there are layoffs, predictably not long after the first of the year, yet the CEO can spend 10's of millions to rename the company and change the identity, just to make a mark for herself."
bad,"A typical day steady unless peak season (chaos)"
bad,"Racist company unprofessional manager , supervisors an HR favoritism within company. If your white you right if your black you are wrong. They have a do not rehire list of course and the list consist of not rehiring any black ppl that previously worked they before."
bad,I would not recommend working here. Mistreatment of employees and unfair pay make is not worth it. Also has a lack of organization and stressfulness that make the employees quit.
bad,Management was completely unprofessional and the company itself is unorganized. I do not recommend working for this company at all. Plus retail is a dying business.
bad,"I opened and closed store, made change and bank deposits, greeted customers, helped with product choices and trained new associates on proper customer service procedures."
bad,"I have never walked out of a job in my life until this one. The company has ridiculous expectations and crazy policies. They micromanage you to death and don't actually let their managers manage. The ""training"" is a joke. I guess this would be the perfect job for those who don't like to think for themselves and want no challenge except trying to figure out who's stealing shoes.  On top of all of that they spy on your Facebook and other social media pages, that was really the last straw for me. Good luck to anyone who needs a job so badly they take this one!"
bad,"Worst job ever. The management sets unrealistic expectations that even themselves could not reach. Product is made overseas and is poor quality. If you can do as I say and not as I do you might have a chance working at this place. Do not trust anyone at this organization for they will stab you in the back for a chance at advancement. This should not surprise me since their product, customer service and ethics is lacking."
bad,"Management has no clue what they are doing.. zero experience that supervisor have. Do not no how to mentor there associates.. 40hours are never guaranteed no company incetives. Also no 401k.. they treat people like they are trash.. I rather go work in the fields, then work there. Low paying jobs."
bad,Store manager plays favoritism. Very argumentative. One sided. High turn over employee rate. I have been with the company for 10 years mainly because of my availability. I was passed up for the store manager position and that is why it is time for me to leave.
bad,"If you enjoy being taken advantage of and over worked and under paid, this is the company for you! With passive aggressive store managers, and incompetent district managers this makes for a super stressful work environment that is often understaffed. Rest assured the assistant managers are there to save the day when nobody else feels like doing their job. My pay would not even fathom the thought of allowing me to live on my own comfortably let alone actually having a life outside of the job. This company needs some serious remodel on how to successfully keep a staff and pay them appropriately."
bad,"I very much enjoyed my customers and my responsibilities!! Unfortunately my enthusiasm started to diminish after just a few months. I noticed my store manager padding the inventory with stolen merchandise that he had not included on audit. (customers steal the shoes, not the boxes) After several weeks of store manager telling me not to include on audit, and store manger recieving a bonus for ""NO SHRINK"" reported, I notified the DM. Store manager was dismissed immediately. There was never acknowledgement of any kind from DM or company regarding my tip regarding this issue."
bad,"Old fashioned, redundant operations make triple the work for employees, causing less time for customer service. The back room was so tiny and packed that I had a panic attack half the times I went in there. No place to take a break, had to eat either on the keyboard of the computer in the back or in the bathroom. Last but not least, a HORRIBLE store manager. She was 35 minutes late to open the store, which had me waiting outside in New England winter with no apology and she didn't allow me to make up that 35 minutes either. Literally worked there for 2 weeks and couldn't take it anymore. Now almost a year later, they still can't get another assistant manager to stay."
bad,Not organized. Incomplete documentation to work from... No communication. Negative finger pointing environment.
bad,Not the best place to work. If u like to be micromanaged and being harassed this place is for you. HR does nothing to help employees. They offer temps a full time position then tell them that they won't hire them because there's nothing open.
bad,Main bosses like 2 waist workers time with meetings Everyday there is a lot of favoritism people who do less for some reason get pay more have to get along with managers to stay on job ohh and the ladies they are so not friendly they boss you around to make it clear is the older ladies and like 3 or 4 conceded ones that go to find a man instead of working.
bad,Over the last five years the company moved from an employee focused company to being just about the bottom line. A very tough environment for the field
bad,"management is closeminded and uninspiring, everyone there does the bare minimum of their job. they always want you to do more, they never recognize hard workers."
bad,Management would tell you to make deliveries with no insurance and no registration. Management was horrible supervisors don’t care about employees just performance.
bad,"The distribution center in Lebanon is not safe at all. If you have an emergency or family problems come up and miss one day they will fire you. When hired, they don't tell you how much you'll be paid or what type of employment it is but later will tell you it's only seasonal. Poor management and not understanding of emergency situations at all or very family oriented so if you have a family it may not be the place for you. Also no benefits were offered. Overall the work was simple, some supervisors rocked while you'd never even see others."
bad,"Worked for the company for about 3 years. Several different stores, total of 3 districts. Never made it past an assistant. If you're looking to grow with the company make sure to get in good with your immediate supervisors or you'll basically end up in a dead end job. Massive amounts of favoritism and turn over in most stores. Also they pay their non salary managers next to nothing for the work load and responsibilities. Would not recommend."
bad,"They do a ""cleaning house"" of people. They lay people of because it slow and then hire New people a month later. They also make it hard to move up in the company."
bad,"is never enough hours to cover shifts, they expect so much from employees and never receive anything in return, they make you do everything from opening all alone in the  morning and be alone for up to 5 or 6 hours, is never a thank you from upper management, for them your're  worth a number only."
bad,"This job isn't what you expect it to be, first of all management doesn't know what they are doing there, they don't know their right from their left, also they tell you one thing then they do another, them boys need to get their act together before they apply for management. The only good thing about this place that I liked was all the beautiful woman that work there."
bad,"Worked there for over 10 years. The company asks too much from their management team, but not willing to give raises for performance or ever give 40 hours to ""full-time"" employees. If you're in school and looking for a part-time job, this is a great place. If you're looking for a career, this is a horrible place to work"
bad,"I was hired as a sales associate and worked my up to management after a year of being there. I loved it! But, many of the managers that I had started with left for other opportunities, I was on my third store managers going into my second year of being there. There is a lot of drama that goes on within the management that is unnecessary. The environment that was created for my store at that point was extremely stressful so I left after being there for four years."
bad,"i never worked customer service before (call center) and being a degreed employee, degree in *Remains anonymous* , i took the approach ""just get in the door"" meaning starting at a entry level position i can work my way up or get the position i desired, being a internal candidate. WELP i was wrong. its difficult to advance, the pressure they put on you to take calls should be a crime. everyone cant have that ""cheerful uppity voice"" brown shoe looks for in every associate, NO MATTER YOUR ETHNICITY... the playing field is not fair.. and the quality assurance is terrible and bias!!! that is a big factor on your career advancement. "
bad,"If  you are already a well paid executive, apply here.You will receive an amazing signing bonus, then receive a salary competitive with the largest corporations in America. If you are associate level, good for stepping stone path, but plan to move on to another company after 2 years. Associates are penalized for executive bad decisions and management. Jobs are lost, departments downsized, upper management remains and continues receiving bonuses. Remaining associates receive nothing."
bad,"Before I left for maternity leave (was there for 2.5 yrs) this place was fun and everyone did thier part. The store manager was amazing. She was the best boss I ever had best of all she cared about her employees and did whatever she could to keep everyone happy. She ended up leaving the company before I came back. Our new store manager was horrible. He did not get enough training. he had no idea what he was doing there, he also had no expiernce in retail. The whole store was falling apart. He refused to staff me with people so I could pump milk for my newborn. I talked to the district manager which made it worse. He made my life miserable. I went partime so it could be easier for everyone. It only got worse. The manager was rude, refused to talk to me, didn't know anything that was going on within the store. If I pointed anything wrong with the standard of the store I just got eye rolls. I gave up and ended up quitting. Then he refused to give me my sick hours when I had to call out. The district manager didn't care and hr didn't care. They ended up hiring all new people since everyone left the company."
bad,"Unfortunately within such a large organization there are multiple steps & often a lot of hoop jumping to be able to complete one task in the step of buying shoes. Different information is given daily from multiple people making it extremely difficult to plan buys with product that will actually go into production. Several people working to get the shoes bought aren't always willing to be a team player making it extra difficult to get orders completed & ultimately delivered to the customer."
bad,Nice working quarters and challenging work assignments with the tools to complete the assignments with excellence.  Promotion practices seem to be more of favoritism than qualifications.  Tough place for an African American person to be promoted or recognized; Need more diversity in senior managment
bad,"Don't do it guys, seriously. Your support managers are either not there or rude and hateful. The longer you are there the worst off you are. Non competitive pay, unsafe to work with violence being shrugged off by corporate. Please guys, its not worth it trying to protect their shoes."
bad,Job duties in initial job description and interview did not correlate with actual job function which made it very difficult during annual review. Current state of retail is challenging which led to constant threat of being laid off or fired. Constant stress of doing more with less people.
bad,"a typical day at work for anyone, whether it be associate or manager, includes customer engagement, selling and customer service. The most enjoybable part of the job is meeting all the new customers"
bad,"My manager does not give me enough hours, treated me poorly (even though I worked my hardest) and not given a chance to advance. Manager treated the assistant managers with more respect than me."
bad,"BWS is the epitome of big business. If you want to be a true designer, Brown Shoe STL is not for you. Quantity over quality is standard practice. The bottom line (profit margin) is the top priority. Sales force fears change and new concepts and will only get behind whats proven very safe. Brands end up chasing trends rather than staying on leading edge or even contemporary. Management style in design & development is about pointing the finger rather than solving the problem."
bad,"Working at Brown Shoe (now Caleres) was not a great experience. Management was not involved and you never knew where you stood in terms of your performance. This happened over time, as management changed. initially, the company was great to work for."
bad,I worked hard for this company and even moved for them.  Watch your back because they will stab you in the back. I want the past few years of my life back. I missed so much working so hard for this company to be released by a new District Manager who had only spent about 10 minutes with me.
bad,I had fun with my staff but there was little advancement in my local area.
bad,I enjoyed working here to an extent. Some of hte management were quite unprofessional. The atmosphere for the most part was quite positive.
good,"I feel that retail job is a tempory job due to the exhaustion of customers and working weekends. I do not enjoy the unset hours, but that is retail and a good high school job"
good,Enjoyed working with customer to resolve issues. Co-workers are great to work with. The idea shift would be Monday thru Friday. Working every other weekend doesn't allow you to spend quality time with your spouse and children.
good,Great place to start at as far as career. Gave me great customer service skills. I was there for almost four years and I left because I wanted to work somewhere else to build on what I already knew and to gain new experiences.
good,"I watched this company go through many changes until I couldn't take anymore.  The pay was low and frankly not competitive for the industry.  I am fortunate for the experience of working there, but really would have liked to see things change."
good,I liked working at Brown Shoe. It wasn't a tough job and could be fun. I had ran into a problem with sexual harassment and nothing was done to fix the problem so I left because I didn't feel comfortable knowing something more could of been done.
good,Worked here for a year. Managers changed and my raise was forgotten. My last store manager was a brown noser who would turn her back on you to make herself look good to our dm. I met a lot of great people but I think corporate needs to work with district managers in finding better suited store managers. If you're looking for a full time assistant manager position you can forget about it with this company. At least I got a year of managerial experience from it.
good,"All of the responsibility is on the material handlers and drivers yet are somehow kept in the dark about everything going on."
good,"Ok if you're looking for just a job.  Long hours,  no set schedule. "
good,Employees need to focus on the job itself. Productivity would be down due to jealousy and uneducated individuals.
good,I began as a heel trimmer. Moved to the dowel pressing department.  I was a shop steward for my area.  The company was downsizing and closing several locations within the state.  No real since of job security.  Management was not transparent with employees as far as operations and expectations other that quotas desired.
good,"The job was pretty nice and the pay and benefits were nice as well. There were plenty of fun events organized by either the company and/or the management for my department. I worked in the Consumer Care department in the call center. Since it is technically a retail job, it was very stressful during the holidays and back to school seasons with longer shifts, mandatory overtime and volunteered overtime with many many back to back calls. "
good,Pressure to meet budget . Forced to implement short staffing. Sales goals too high in a declining mall environment ............................................
good,"Great colleagues, good work/life balance and benefits. There could be more mentorship with management and upward job progression/career track. Overall, a good place to work."
good,done material handling and die cutting at this job was a good place to work but plant was closing down soon.also could work overtime when needed to make up a day  at work.
good,"Good job, good employees.  Culture is very corporate but the benefits are good and the schedule can be good as well.  I liked working for the company"
good,"Management is always having you cover additional accounts and additional work that is not in your job description, sometimes to appeal to the salesforce.  A lot of times when you would ask for assistance, none would be available."
good,"Keeping up with every customer , while watching who may be shoplifting."
good,Every day was just a little different from the last. Believe more training and guidance would have been beneficial for management in our store.
good,The communication amongst departments and strong leadership are lacking at Brown Shoe California leading to a work place where employees often feel lost or directionless. 
good,"had a good experience. learned new skills with new teams."
good,Overall it was a typical retail employer experience. The company is very structured and follows procedures above all else. I found it difficult to move upwards in my career at this company. Employee satisfaction was also quite low.
good,It is a decent company to work for. You get all the benefits as well as vacation and sick pay immediately. On a rare occasion they provide lunch for you. I am just tired of doing the same thing all day every day.
good,Over all the management team is strong.  The sales team is results driven and there is significant competition within team.  The sales cycle is very short which creates significant peaks in hours required to get your work done.   The shoe show dates are not flexible which sometimes conflicts with family commitments.
good,"Fast paced!! Need the ability to multitask as there are many things going on. Learned a lot working here. Ability to drive sales, train and coach employees to drive sales."
good,Great job if you are single and/or have no kids. Great for somebody going to school during daytime. The heat is crazy. Pretty easy job just a bunch of lifting in the heat.
good,I worked for this company for 6 years and only reason I left was because my store closed. The DM is very professional and is a great company to work for.
good,"great environment, great management.... love the encouragement to get tasks done. Love my atmosphere while i am working."
good,We had to get the work out off a line so that you could meet your production quota.  The thing that I learned most from working with this company is  how to get along with coworkers. the hardest part of this job was to make sure you had enough shoes to make your quota. My coworkers were enjoyable to work with.
good,enjoyed this job very much - best perk was the discount on shoes
good,"when I worked there is was fun and exciting , but now the culture has changed . Do not know how it is now ."
good,Worked in several different positions throughout my career.
good,Worked for this company twice. First time was great and had fun doing it. Second time was more stressful and arduous. Better pay elsewhere for same title. and it's better if your a student or GM.
good,"Some truly great people in the organization, but also several people I hope to never see again. Direct supervisors always cared about me and my career, but upper management has little interest in the employees, or the community (CEO flies in every week). Consistently pay below market pricing for Manager positions and lower."
good,"I worked for this company for 6 years, 3 in Maryland and almost 3 in New Jersey.  "
good,Fast moving day. I learned to develope people skills in managing my own department. I enjoyed working with most of the people. The hardest part of the day is trying to listen to other managers point of views on life. The fun in trying to see how we were going to get the work done for the day.
good,i liked the fast paced environment. there was a wide variety of people that worked there. there was not a lot of down time and opportunities for overtime
good,"Great place to work and meet all kinds of different people. A typical day at the office is to come in, get free coffee or soda.  Great perk!"
good,"In the product development deparment, there is no typical day because we were involved in many projects so we had to wear many hats. Very dinamic place. As an employee, you learned to do many task and that was what I enjoyed about Brown Shoe/American Sporting Goods. Management and co-workers are very respectful and always helped as much as they could in any given project. I feel that the hardest part of the job was to sit for hours on your desk and do oracle entry, but it was not hard because of the task but because it took a long time. The things I enjoyed the most were to go to material shows, trend shopping, and see the final product after working for a long time on a tech pack."
good,"My typical day involves coming into the office in the morning between 7 to 9 and doing whatever work is noted as being a priority until about 4-5 when I go home. The benefits are not the best but are certainly better than a lot of companies, but salary levels seem to suffer because the company thinks it is giving great benefits. That said usually management tries to do good by their employees, but if the company doesn't do well in the market the employees are the first to feel it in the form of no raises and lay offs."
good,Solid job. Great staff. Doesn't provide a stress free environment.
good,"It has been an experience like no other. Managment has change several times within a year period.  The warehouse is not climate controlled in most areas. This company has a high turn over rate and could use a little up to date computer software as well as organization of work flow and material handling.  New management is trying to improve and refine our company in all aspects...productive, quality of packaging, management and employee relations, customer service, effectiveness methods to get job done faster and with as little customer discretion"
good,"This job was great as we got a lot of positive work done.  I helped people with general banking needs.  I also got commission for making balance transfers.  The management was not fair.  I think they discriminated against me.  I never made a mistake.  MBNA went out of business after 9/11, 2001."
good,Answering heavy flow of daily emails
good,I've learned to have a lot of patience. you need to know what you're talking about especially shoes because you want customers to be comfortable with what they are wearing out!
good,"You sit at a desk and answer incoming calls."
good,This was a great retail company. helped provide all the tools you needed to succeed. Fun work environment and great employees to work with. Overall had a great experience.
good,Retail environment. Worked alone a lot. Travel was required. Most of the employees and management was friendly & helpful. Hardest part was the long hours
good,How to handle busy situations with team work. How to handle a department by yourself by staying motivated and giving it my all for 8 hours. So staying busy Most of the day really help me get thru the days.
good,"Received inbound calls for placing shoe orders, I tracked packages, I was corporate office for shoe store so we handle customer complaints and commets"
good,"Responsible for large list of accounts,meeting changing customer requirements and  system upgrades. Worked as a team player in a group of 5 associates. "
good,Too focused on money. Employees get little time with families on weekednds and holidays.
good,Call center environment with no windows. required to work one weekend day.
good,"I worked with this company for several years.  It provided me ample opportunities to grow as a sales manager, and taught me strategies and coaching techniques to implement with my associates."
good,This job can be fun. The customers personalities basically determine how things will go. I had a great boss who took the time to occassionally teach me things beyond my paygrade just in case.
good,Love it. Get your shoes delivered to your desk! Stay up with the trends and see the celebraties wear the shoes!
good,"Worked here for nearly six years.  Generally excellent management; fair and reasonable.  Customer service work is tough but great teammates made a huge difference.  Pay was fair and the benefits were great."
good,This is a good company with dedicated hard working people.  There is a relaxed atmosphere yet there is an underlying drive for results.  It makes for good company  DNA.
good,This job gives you the opportunity to learn how to make executive decisions that will benefit the overall objective.
good,Enjoy working here. Work life balance is nice. The size of the company lends itself for various opportunities to grow within the company both locally and across the country.
good,"regular day of work as a manager team member is pretty straight forward, you come to your working place, review numbers from days/weeks/months and year before, analyzing opportunities and how you need to approach them on a new day to win for the day."
good,"The job culture has changed, but still a nice stable company to work for.  Get in with the right mentors and you can succeed.  It is an open floor plan which can be distracting, however wonderful for sharing business ideas and plans, as long as they include you in the conversation."
good,"sales and service"
good,"Start with little supervision, learn other position on daily biases . My manager was very good by cross training in everyway. I get along well with co-worker very well. The hardest part of my job was keeping busy when we found out we were closing."
good,"I love shoes and being able to help fulfill my customers needs and creating relationships with my customers. I guess I would say I am an old school customer service individual, in that if the customer likes the person they will come back again, not necessarily because of the product but because of the great service they received. In addition, working to help develop my staff to work towards career advancement gives me a great sense of accomplishment.  In the current economy, it is very difficult to try to do more with less.  This is the main reason I have decided to make a change. I do not feel I am allowed to be the kind of manager I want to be in this climate."
good,Managed Help Desk Staff and new store open/close staff.  Management was easy to work with and it was a pleasant environment.
good,"I enjoyed all of my 10 years that I worked for Caleres, Inc. It was a great company with extremely talented and caring people to collaborate with. The pay could be improved for internal employees."
good,The people were fun! The job was interesting and fulfilling until the downsizing began and then it became very stressful. The company has changed in recent years and a more updated review should be considered.
good,"amazing company, compensation not great. restructuring causes positions to get eliminated and difficult to get promoted. Company is really fun and CEO is awesome"
good,"First and foremost, when I resigned from my position at Caleres, it was a very difficult decision. I loved my job and was happy to go to the office everyday.  However, as I have young children, I needed to improve my work/family balance.  I was proud to work at Caleres.  However, the international division at Caleres was not treated with appropriate respect and attention.  Concerning certain brands in the company portfolio, the international sales team of which I was a large part, drove more business than the domestic team.  A typical day involved wearing all hats.  In addition to sales, I worked daily with logistics, quality assurance, customer service, brand management, marketing and finance.  I learned more than I have ever learned in my career and was exposed to every aspect of international business.  I would give the culture a grade of a B.  The hardest part of the job was the constant downsizing of the international division.  Although I was grateful to never be included in the downsizing, there was simply not enough time in the day to complete the workload.  I am a very hard worker but it took over my life.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the international travel and exposure to new cultures.  The relationships that I built with our international partners will be lifelong."
good,I love getting to meet new people and helping them with certain challenges that they may have and It also helps me grow and learn new things every day
good,"Strong team work and strategic thinking are paramount. I am lucky to be surrounded by a good team that works together to solve issues and support one another. We are encouraged to be flexible enough to circumvent any system / back of the house issues that arise, and are challenged to find creative ways around them."
good,"Good place to work, hours aren't bad and benefits are good.  Working in customer service can be difficult at times when customers are rude, but it is rewarding helping others."
good,This company was really lovely to work for .mangers were all really kind and care for the company very much.hard workers only problems never was able to full time hours
good,"Preparing market reports, opening store, handling sales and returns, promote, work on displays."
good,"the pay was horrible...$85.00 per week..General office duties...ran a teletype machine to communicate with the shoe factories located in different states to be sure that shoes that were ordered were in fact available.Management was very helpful to new employees. Hardest part of the job...making a living on the minimal pay. Most enjoyable part of the job...got a huge discount on famous name shoes for the family...Mother, Father and Nephews"
good,"Typical day was spent making new shoe buys for the next season, and filling in current shoe styles from the 200 shoe departments in my division."
good,"This is one of the few companies that does retail ""right"". Treats the Guest right as well as the staff."
good,"The people at Caleres are what makes it such a great place to work.  The nature of my job required me to be available to communicate with overseas.  This often meant early morning or late evening meetings.  Such is the nature of the job, though.  Leadership varied throughout the organization.  Some areas thrived on fantastic leadership.  Others were more than lacking."
good,"Caleres is a great company that stretches back over a century.  The culture is very diverse and energetic.  The people are passionate about what they do and take a lot of pride in their work, so it is a pleasure to work with so many people who care.  Management is good and leadership has vision, and has been very growth focused in the last few years.  Would like more communication from the top more often - I think it goes a long way with the rank and file, more than leadership often realizes.  Overall Caleres is a great company to work for, and one that will continue to grow in spite of the tough retail environment."
good,Very easy going fun job. Management is helpful and customers are awesome most times. I have been here going on five years and every year has been very good here.
good,I worked at Brown Shoe Company for a little over a year. I enjoyed my time there in the call center and then working with the email team. Most people had great things to say about the company.
good,"I started out as a machine operator making shoes, after a couple of years I was promoted to supervisor. I checked quality of employees work, and trained new operators, answered to foreman and plant manager. Let this job to move to Memphis, TN with my new husband.
