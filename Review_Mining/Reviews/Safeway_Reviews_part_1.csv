rating,review
bad,"Don't waste your time they treat u like dirt.I worked there almost four years ,some of the managers have no respect talk to any kind of way.They cut my hour’s from 33 to 17.This have to Stop"
bad,"Understaffed, overworked, and they do not care about their employees at all. If you have a disability stay away. The management consistently broke union rules. The union forgets about pharmacy staff when negotiations are due. Hostile work environment. Very gossipy. People can treat other people like garbage and get away with it for years if they're even slightly good at their job."
bad,"This is a job for those straight out of high school who still live with their parents.  Understand that management does not care if you’re sick, if you’ve had a death in "
bad,"Management has the mentality of: “if your not with me then your against me”"
bad,"The whole industry was toxic and very discriminatory towards my background and religion. My former manager pushed me over limits which would be considered borderline illegal and attempted to fire me at any given moment, hence putting in my own two weeks."
bad,"This company has absolutely no regard for family and work life balance.  They have very limited help and expect the world from their employees. "
bad,"I get that in the company of Safeway I've done some things that they may have not liked, but they pull strings and make my work experience there miserable, i felt harassed and unappreciated for everything i did i tried but guess it wasn't good enough so i felt unwanted and unhappy being there."
bad,"This was the worst job I’ve ever had. Management didn’t care about employees whatsoever, my time spent at work wasn’t respected, the manager tried to worm her way into my personal life, and she would throw objects at our heads."
bad,"Employees for the most part are very unhappy, but I believe this to be true in most grocery jobs. Managers are way over stressed and its the whole trickle down effect. To be honest there is not enough work to keep you busy unless you work as a picker. The coworkers are always looking for someone to be angry at and management doesn’t back you unless they feel threatened.  If you want to be miserable go get a job there please.  They pay the least in the 302 union."
bad,"I was never treated fairly. I was discriminated against in so many levels. No respect for privacy. Management tell your business. Very gossiping place. Pay sucks! I was never paid for my vacation they scheduled me to go out on 2 years in a row! Very racist company. If u work there for many years, these employees can go and shove on minors and nothing was done! This happens to my daughter."
bad,"I've terminated my employment. "
bad,"Working there provided me absolutely nothing. My pay barley helped me pay my bills, and hours were conflicting so I couldn't look for other work opportunities."
bad,Worst job ever rather go hungry and they beat you out your money and manager sucks thinks he better then everyone and terrible job period.would never work for again for nothing..
bad,"Another horrible place to work . People are constantly used. Very low wages unless you are a company veteran. Everyone is miserable there and wants to quit ,b ut they are all afraid of losing their benefits ."
bad,This place is a very horrible place to work. Your management team is changed every so often and then when you get a team that you like they change it on you so i feel like this company has alot that needs to be fixed.
bad,If you want to be a workhorse with no chance of advancing  safeway will be great for you.  They suck to work for!!!! Let me repeat.... they really suck to work for. Have fun getting up every day with no actual purpose to your life.
bad,Store manager only knows how to point out faults. Your hard work gets met with knit picking and complaints. No interests in making the store function more efficiently. Pay is very low for the work that is expected. Even fast food pays more and expects less of their employees!
bad,"Be prepared to suddenly lose your job, hours being continually cut, being understaffed and your coworkers stressed. People not showing up to work is common, all while management and the union, which you pay highly for, do nothing. I wouldn't recommend working here with all the stores closing, workers terminated and the stores reopening with all new minimum workers who are part time. Sobey's cares nothing for its workers."
bad,Horrible Hiring manager you only get trained on the computer they barely train you on the register they harass you if you go on your breaks and they think you are taking long when you barely went on your break
bad,Negitive is my review. Lie to customers everyday was not what I signed up for . management pass the buck every chance they get .  being a bullie is encouraged in management
bad,Corporate has a clear attitude of superiority over their associates. They do not like people who are intelligent and do not like to advance careers. Cheap company who slashes hours of higher paid in order to hire cheaper labor. Avoid!!!!
bad,"This store is the smallest in all of Colorado but the demands for production by corporate are based on a much larger store which presses the overworked understaffed environment. Front end workers do the most but get paid the very least, multiple health code violations in the back rooms are often overlooked and management is affluent. ZERO DIVERSITY at this location. Take your business and or work ethics somewhere else."
bad,Racist and unprofessional. I wish they handled things more settle . They would get a new manager every new month and they would look for reasons to release you even without proof and has happened numerous times
bad,"Worked there for 3 years and besides my supervisor and a few friends I met along the way, it was horrible. Management only cared about the money and if you weren't making his numbers look good you were on his bad side. I felt like I was slowly dying there. Unless your in high school and want something temporary, sure go ahead. But do not expect making a living unless your a manager or higher up."
bad,Im I had a front end manager that bullied people to no end follow them in the breakroom follow them into the bathroom couldn't let me use the bathroom and treated me like s*** I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemy! Management's terrible there to cliquish be careful when you work there
bad,"I did not have a good experience. The managers were biased, and I was treated with disdain when I had to change my availability. It was hard work for low pay."
bad,They are unsanitary and always have spoiled meats and attempt to sell them for half price. They have cashiers doing everyone else’s job If someone calls out or If they don’t feel like doing it. They’ll cut your hours whenever they feel like it.
bad,"Do not work at Safeway I worked in the bakery for 2 days and never got any breaks, also never got a schedule and asked more than once, disorganized store, and no one communicates anything with each other. The employees are rude at the summit location and unwelcoming to new hires. Too much work for the amount of pay. Left within 2 days of getting hired, such a horrible place to work"
bad,no room for growth here within this company and they need to work on management was a struggle to even go to your sup with a complaint no one seemed to care.
bad,Unfriendly management and training does not reflect the tasks you are required to complete in the workplace. Be prepared to have hours cut if you have a part time position at this company.
bad,"Management is not personable, or care about anything other than number. People are just numbers, not actually people to them. They have clear favorites and doesn’t matter if they do any work or not, as long as you brown nose. Two stores I worked at were exactly the same."
bad,"They will walk all over you. Just don’t work here. They will teach you to do advanced things within departments like inventory, schedule, conference calls, ordering, etc., and never pay you for it or give you credit. No flexibility and no honesty."
bad,"Favoritism, Billy's, drama queens nothing is left confident, always talking about staff behind there backs , don't deal with issues just let people do wat they want late .breaks"
bad,"I Remember just starting out in this place for not even a month in the middle of a remodel Albertsons was merging in with Safeway. Managment was horrible they would pick and choose favorites corporate would laugh at you when you asked where something was. It got to the point that within a month of being there 30 employee's from different departments had put in there 2 weeks in."
bad,"No communication"
bad,Horrible management that isn’t trained properly. Manager sits in the back all day long. Yells at employees gossiping in the whole store. DON’T WORK HERE!!
bad,"No accountability for their actions no proof of what they accuse you of. Bullying, poor treatment towards customers, fowl language everywhere, dirty looks"
bad,"The management is immature, play favoritisms, lack leadership and respect. They do not care that you are a student, parent or have an other responsibility outside of Safeway. They wasn’t Safeway to be priority in your life and don’t pay enough for it. Your hours are inconsistent and you don’t get paid more if they throw you in a different department you weren’t hired in. They over work you with no care."
bad,"Would be double booked for shifts in different departments.  No common courtesy for the employee.  You are simply a number.  Management tells you what you want to hear, but then goes and does something completely different from your discussions."
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this company after awhile. I started as a courtesy clerk and moved up to an all sales associate. Worked in the bakery, as a cashier, and in Starbucks."
bad,Safeway is by far the worst company to work for. The management team walk around like bullies trying to pick A fight. They schedule you whenever they want and when they feel like cutting your hours back they do. Don’t call in sick even if you have sick time as a benefit they will not pay you or allow you to use your benefits. The only one who benefits is Safeway. Worst management team ever.
bad,Managers only cared about how you could make them look good . they had little knowledge of how the front end worked day to day .and no concern fo others safety.
bad,"Horrible, aggressive and dangerous work environment. Please don’t do it to yourself. There’s no security and shoplifters might as well live in the store."
bad,"Managers are horrible. Nobody carries their weight. Never apply to store 1605. Worked two years there as a night stocker. Unfair wages, unqualified managers, understaffed, no communication between anyone, nobody takes responsibility for anything, everybody is constantly playing the blame game. Lots of drama."
bad,It's a union job that requires you pay fees. Hours are spratic and the raise is depressing. NOT WORTH IT! Also the other workers expect you to do work without any sense of direction or guide when you are new
bad,This job will suck the life out of you. The pay is not equivalent to the amount of work and effort required. Management changes every 3 months and most don’t even learn your name most of the time. Worst 5 years of my life. Lots of people have to drink just to be able to do the job...don’t waist your life!!
bad,"They were always understaffed and not getting breaks on time. Always had to bag own groceries while checking and always at the checkstand busy with mad customers because of the lines. "
bad,I worked for this place for 10 years doing all the extras . Stepping into the operational specialist roll when asked . Never got paid corporate pay. Was sent to may stores to help with other departments and never got any kind of appreciation or compensation. You will be relocated against your will no matter what your situation is. Don't expect for this company to work around any thing in your life cause it won't happen. They don't care if you have kids go to college get sick anything.  They will over work you and you will NEVER get a raise at all. They will use you as long as you let them and if you ask for a raise or complain to corporate they will find a way to push you out. They invade your privacy monitor all your social media take screen shots of any posts they can hold against you even if has nothing to do with the company. Beware don't work for this place.
bad,I got hired on as a casual associate so no benefits till you joined a Union. Poor management and the culture was poor. Had people telling that they were going to release me or have me go to a area that I was not hired on to do.
bad,"The management at the store was good, however the high up the management chain you went the worse it was. They do not care about their employees. They see their employees as an ID number not actual people. They have no forgiveness and are the worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,"At this job I barely got any hours and didn't get paid enough to afford the union costs. The reason for my lack of hours is because of ""seniority"". I would not recommend this as your first job, or any job at that."
bad,"Management is terrible, Produce manager is also the union rep so nothing is fair. Watched her take advantage of her workers by demanding heavy workloads, Ignore mental health needs, and make the job seem like no matter how hard you work it's just not good enough. Working for Safeway has much been like going to high school again, it didnt matter how hard you worked if they didnt like you, RUMORS! It's crazy the things that were spread throughout the store that weren't true, and the 2 years I worked there I even noticed my mental health go downhill. Just one of the many examples on their unfairness, I seen someone who worked there for 10 years be fired for an unauthorized discount on coffee from Starbucks. You're better off going back to school and getting a real job."
bad,"Do not recommend to anyone ever, worst job I ever had. Management was very poor and unprofessional, hours weren't good and we weren't payed enough for the work we had to do"
bad,"It's high school with all the clicks, I was a gm management and I was wrkng 50+ hrs a week I we're just so much I actually was taken from Safeway by ambulance and found I was suffering from over-exhaustion and spent 3 days in the hospital and one week off of work when I return to work they had given my position away I thought that was very unfair very rude and definitely Mary they walked around with noses in the air . Had huge egos over their jobs you're not better than anyone else"
bad,Just at the 6500 piney branch rd Nw is horrid and management should be fired immeadiatly I wouldn’t recommend anyone going to work at that location especially in the nasty produce dept
bad,"I hated working at Safeway it is a very stressful environment they Do NOT and I repeat They DO NOT care about their employees the Director is demanding verbally and emotionally abusive,  the upper Managers do nothing about it  they are Racist , they consistently break the law by not giving you 10 min breaks you barely are  allowed to  use the bathroom and poor training .There is no room for advancement , it is a dead end job your wasting your time"
bad,"Managers yelled at employees in front of customers and were very demeaning. If you approached them for anything they didn’t like they cut your hours. Sometimes no hours at all. If you get hurt on the job don’t expect them to pay. They use their doctors for exams and won’t use the report from a personal doctor. They call you the day after your injury to come work even if it’s just greeting customer because if you don’t they will be fined $20,000.  They do not take care of their employees at all! Stay away from this place and any of their other brands at all cost!!"
bad,The Safeway on market is the safeway that needs to be closed immediately. Yeah you get a paycheck.  But you can also get stabbed in the parking lot. Yeah its union which is great unless youre at Safeway where the managers lie through their teeth to cover their self.  Dont get hurt on the clock there.  Trust me on that one. If they didnt treat me like garbage  and try to trick me out of workers comp.
bad,Just look forward to being considered nothing. Coworkers are not happy and they change management every year so you will never have a clear example of what to do.
bad,"Employee who have been there longer than 10 years have the tendency to gossip, spread lies to get ahead in there work place. Lack of training meaning the show you once and tell you your ready and get mad when you ask questions."
bad,Just don't... I'm telling you. For your benefit... Do not work for Safeway or any grocery stores. Management surprised me that they were so bad. The hours were terrible.
bad,The management it the worst I have ever seen. They let people get away with harassment and it’s “just another day on the job.” Or you get told thats just the way it is. Its a sickening place to work.
bad,"I lose sleep and I am miserable all the time due to this job hate it !!!!  All they die is cut hours and make one person do the work of 3 people. Management is ungrateful never wish you a good morning nor a good evening when you go to them with an issue they are non compliant to your feelings or to the fact you’ve been with the company forever. They are very ungreatful  of their aging staff and make them work as hard as a20 year old shame on you safeway -sobeys"
bad,"I did not have any experience no proper training and no manager for seafood department. It was dirty and not well kept. Everything mislabeled, it was a nightmare. I was getting paid minimum wage and doing everything.  Employees were bossing me around and didn't want to work w seafood. Store manager was rude to all latinos & didn't  have no empathy when I wasn't feeling too good. Didn't go back one day."
bad,"Horrible nothing is positive about this company they will suck you dry and make you feel bad about your self "
bad,I was expected to do the job of 3 people for minimum wage and no benefits. I learned it's a bad company to work for. Customers yelled at me because there was nobody to help get the lines down.   I hated this job. It was the worst I've ever had.
bad,The store manager has no idea how to run the store and picks favorites. she also fired half of our crew for no reason and refused to replace them. People were kept on the schedule even though they didn't work there anymore. ( meaning everyone that did still work there got no days off because she kept scheduling people that didn't work there)
bad,"Management communication is a low"
bad,"I've worked at 2 locations, and spoken with other employees. It seems across the board a bad place to work, some locations worse than others. My supervisor consistently refused to post our schedule until the night before, and our manager didn't do anything about it. Constantly sexually-harassed by customers and co-workers. And security."
bad,I have 20 years of retail management and my experience didnt matter had to start at the bottom. Just moved to the area so I needed a job. Management liked to talk down and yell at the employees. They just dont care and that is the culture from corporate down.
bad,"Learned alot, decent management. Loved my costumers and coworkers. Way to much corporate involvement on the store level. Hours were very difficult being a single mother"
bad,"Terrible hours , terrible pay. Terrible management. They allow so many people to call out but don’t fire them , manager will not do anything when someone harasses  you they will still have they employed and will even put them on the same shift as you when you’ve told management multiple times you are uncomfortable. Management is childish"
bad,It's retail. What do you expect? Wage theft? Check. Cutting department hours and making you do more work for the same pay? Check. A livable paycheck? Ch... no.
bad,"Terrible place to work. Management not willing to train you, rather have you do the same thing over and over again. Ok if you like repetition and no chance of advancement."
bad,It was there long to get store hours  the manager I didn't  get along with at all. the store had a roach problem . I did get to grow and learned to have great customer service skills
bad,This store would be awesome under new management. The manager is nothing but a bully who treats her employees like they’re not to be respected. The environment is so intense because everyone walks on eggshells scared that she the store manager might do something if they speak up for themselves. Instead the store manager deliberately makes it so uncomfortable that employees left to rite quit or transfer.. This is by far the worst store to work at. Wouldn’t recommend it in a trillion years. All management needs to get fired!!!!
bad,"I dislike working here but I love my coworkers, they’re very sweet and understanding. Management sucks. The main person who’s in charge of the whole store should be let go of, they have so many marks against them from the union."
bad,"poor management who doesn't know how to talk to people with respect and doesn't know how to schedule. either over schedules you too much or none at all. only allows one or two people to work at the Starbucks which is very difficult, as it can get very busy to handle all customers and preparations for orders."
bad,The work enviroment is created by a poor management team people base on their needs and numbers they have to make. Lack of trust from management is a big issue. Courtesy clerks have reported to be looked down from managers also.
bad,"Nothing gets done unless you contact the Union Rep or HR about whatever your problem is. I worked at Safeway for 4 years. I practically ran a department on my own but when the opportunity for them arose to give me a raise and put me in charge, they ignored it.  There were conflicts between workers in my department and I brought it to management's attention, they ignored them too."
bad,"I started out as a deli clerk. ""Promoted""(MOVED) to bakery clerk then to cake decorator because of my skills. Still no pay raise. I worked thete from 2012 to 2015. Aspired to be a bakery manager given the fact that i literally did EVERYTHING. Down to ordering, inventory, baking, cleaning, cake decorating, packing out to cases. As still no promise of more money. No raise. The merchandiser kept promising she was going to make me bakery manager and it never happened!!!"
bad,"They treat team members very badly , especially dept managers.  Every week I was told what a bad manager I was even tho sales were up and the department was on point.  Nothing is ever good enough . That's why I stepped down"
bad,"Absent management, frequent management turnover, insufficient training, not enough staff"
bad,"Highly not recommended, poor senior management, very stressful place to work, no hours , management positions, your just a number in their eyes and computers, this company is falling apart."
bad,"Since April of '19 working here has been a nightmare. New management is running the store into the ground while cutting hours, expecting more to be done in less time, and not communicating their expectations between other managers and employees."
bad,"My review Summary clears up my experience with Safeway. I definitely were Luckily capable to shift to another job after Christmas Day arrived.  "
bad,The management is all over the place. I had to report to 5 different people all asking the same thing. I was forgotten a few times. Customers look at you like your the one who can fix anything and everything. There is not a lot of help and sometimes you have to do tasks that you did not sign up for.
bad,I didn’t enjoy working their at all I was a manager only lasted 5 months because every time I wanted to take a weekend off the store manager had a problem.If you like working long hours and no time off and horrible pay work here I wouldn’t recommend this place to my worst enemy.
bad,The sky falls and you feel like its a beautiful day dont let it get away. Youre on the run but you got no destination in the mud in the maze of her imagination yo ulvoe this town
bad,"Where I worked use to be good, now everyone is all for them self and loves trying to get you fired and the managers don't care at all about it. The management does not care if you have doctors or jury duty or out of town they will threaten to fire you if you don't come in"
bad,Management is always on your back. Always make sure you are doing exactly what you are supposed to do. And if you can’t this isn’t a job for you. So make you are capable of doing that.
bad,"DO NOT WORK AT THE DELI!! You get paid minimum wage but over worked. There is no TEAM EFFORT! So you basically pull your weight and others. Management is unprofessional. They have an ""IN"" crowd.. It's like being back in high school."
bad,"Typical day included doing daily tasks such as bringing in carts, bagging groceries, sweeping entire store, helping customers find items, and checking customers out."
bad,"The only good part of the job were the other employee's that were my peers.  The main Manager was awful.  Training was insufficient with high expectations.  I hear from other employee's at other safeways that management has been a issue."
bad,"Management  Was very poor at listening and trying to help employees. Never could get full time, been there 10 plus years. They have there favorites to promote."
bad,"Management in the beginning was great but after the head-manager left, everything went downhill overtime. By the end of my time there, I was doing some of the management work while getting paid the same amount I made when starting as a cashier. I worked in multiple departments including dairy, frozen, floral, cashier, courtesy clerk, etc... but the pay remained the same"
bad,"Management is selfish, arrogant, racist, and biased. Even if you work as much as possible, you won't get any credit for it and will be treated like a piece of trash. Your only chance is the play the political game and pray that management doesn't already have it out for you, because otherwise you're not even given a chance."
bad,"The lack of training made the job super stressful. There was no material/manuals to look back on when baking, if there was, I was never shown. I trained maybe 2 days before opening the bakery by myself. My trainer was always complaining that he would be done already. He taught me how to destress while he baked everything. I learned how to glaze stuff and destress. Nothing about bake times or how to tell what products are what."
bad,Safeway was the worst job i have ever had. The management was poor. The hours were all over the place. The place was never cleaned and the employees were treated very poorly.
bad,"Confusing place to work. Piled on insurmountable amount of work. Unclear priorities. Weird training methods. Strange co-workers, and management, and plenty of mystery shoppers/shill spies."
bad,Extremely understaffed always. Managment is horrible and disrespectful.  Only guaranteed 16 hours a week. No sales= no hours... usually 4 hour days. Minimum wage with no benefits if you do not work 24 hours a week..
bad,"Horrible company to work for. Nickname from employees; SLAVEWAY. No hours, different jobs than hired for. Horrible management. No training, a sink or swim company."
bad,"It was good until Albertsons took over, it was a great fun work place, it still is a semi nice place to shop at. Customers were good except around the holidays."
bad,"Night crew is overworked, understaffed. Cannot keep employees. You start at $10.80 to work hard, fast and meet all other duty requirements. I was kept after my shift without agreement. Work morale is very poor. Each person I worked with felt they were not appreciated and took no pride in their work or employer. Most were great people in general and their current disposition was not their fault. One woman who was training me began slandering me and other night crew members in Spanish to another employee, right next to me. She was assuming I didn't know Spanish. This concluded my second and last night of my Safeway employment experience."
bad,"I only worked at Safeway for a couple weeks and it was the worst couple weeks of my life basically when you’re just starting you have to drag a cart around the store and cut boxes half the time you don’t even get to it direct with customers because if they make you work the night shift that’s right from 9 PM to 5 AM with only 215 minute breaks I almost collapsed not to mention the middle my fellow employees treated me like dirt like I was an idiot. You have to wear a specific uniform with no exceptions. Bottom line don’t work here if you want to have an enjoyable experience, a moment of down time or a decent pay stub."
bad,making cakes for customers and also making sure they were happy. the hardest part about the job was management and feeling unappreciated.typical day at work was very stressful.
bad,"Very stressful! They want you to do a 2-3 persons job .Want 8 hours worth of work in 5. Pay is awful, don’t make enough for the cost of living in the area.  Short staffed"
bad,"The best things about the company are the benefits, weekly pay, and a few of the coworkers. Union dues used to be taken out in one sum at the beginning of each month. Fortunately, that changed and it is now a small amount each paycheck. "
bad,If anyone ever worked for Safeway in the deli then they should know coming in as a new employee for the deli department they always make you close. They are always short on staff so more then likely your doing your work plus someone else work. Your don't get properly trained. After maybe your second day they make you close by yourself. I don't see anybody being happy working there.
bad,only writing this because indeed is making me write something do not work here they treat their workers poorly pay is not worth the amount of stuff you deal with on a daily
bad,Probably the worst company I've ever worked for. They regularly mistreated their staff and customers alike and performed numerous illegal activity and directed employs to perform unsafe work actions and put out products they knew to be unsafe.
bad,Safeway sucks and they need to remodel the whole store. Most employees are cool but when working there the management sucks and its easy for people to steel from them. the starbucks always is good.
bad,"my typical day at work was to work up to seven different departments, and be given grief if I couldn't finish a job in the hours I was allotted for the department I was working in. The store managers never listened to any complaints any employee had unless it from a department head. My department head would constantly come to work late, leave work early, and disappear from his department for hours at a time, usually to hang out in different departments to chat. Some of the people in my department would just do the bare minimum of work, leaving rotten food sitting on the shelves, and would only clean the department once every couple of months."
bad,"Horrible, I hated working there... there is no words to describe it. Management is horrible. Job duties are horrible. It’s not worth the try to get hired there."
bad,"It's okay,manager was hard to get along with at times. Wish I had better pay. The people I worked with were great and I loved working with the customers, I got to know a lot of them because I worked in such a small town. So it was noce yo see them and it helped cheer me up when my nights eere were dragging on forever!!!"
bad,They call it slaveway for a reason. They will work you over 12 plus hours a day to get the most out of tou and still expect more you will never do enough or be good enough for there unreasonable demands.
bad,Bad place. NO benefits. no clear direction. unsafe place. horrible management. the management does not follow through or give guidance on anything or to anyone.
bad,I did learn people skills but the management was absolutely horrible because they did not respect my school schedule even when I told my supervisors the specific times and days I could or could not be at work they still went over my head and gave me shifts that interfered with my school schedule and I would have to ask people over and over and to cover my shifts because I had important things to do for school.
bad,Mismanagement of employees and lack of attention to detail attributed on a high turnover rate and made it almost impossible to maintain any kind of standard.
bad,"Harassment from grocery manager to other employees, poor management from five different managers, and cutting employee hours but not their own. After 20 years in this company I have seen many managers display the same toxic behavior that no one wants to be around."
bad,This place sucks.manger takes workers hours to work for herself. You can never count on your hours.They hire people who are almost illiterate. They give you one apron.one hat..The place is so dirty I can't figure out how they aren't closed down by health department.
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for since Albertsons took over, too bad they do not know how employees should be treated."
bad,"There are too many managers and they are union members. How can the union represent both the workers and managers? The fee of $13.88 is entirely too high for the minimum wage salary and high school students. Each county gets paid a different wage, in Maryland, every area has the same cost of living."
bad,"The whole time i worked there, there was no set management team. It was a new person every month, making it really hard to move up. They worked me like I was full time but I didn't have any benefits."
bad,it would be busy sometimes and sometimes it would be slow. managers and employees were nice and very friendly. expectations were a little high and soemtimes the demand was ridiculous
bad,"Working at Safeway was a nightmare. The employee retention is a joke, people either work there for <1 year or 10+ years. The management at my store was an absolute joke, and from what I've heard, it's universal. They run on skeleton crews to make it look like they're getting more done with lower costs, and then they get mad at you when 1 person can't complete the workload that should be spreas among at least 3 people. Hours vary so wildly, I've gone from working 4 hours in one week to working 40+ the next. The pay is absolutely not worth it, and they like to train everyone to be a cashier so they can have even less people on the clock, because they can just call up the stockers whenever there's more than 3 people in a line (which is at all times)."
bad,"would not refer anyone to work there"
bad,"Okay, sooo... When I got hired I thought it was gonna be a good gig, right? In hindsight I was so wrong! First, I wasn't even shown how to do my job properly and often left to fend for myself (though my co-workers were always quick to be the first to point out that I botched something up without telling/showing me how to fix said mistake and making sure that I knew how to do it.)"
bad,It's always difficult to work in a retail environment. But Safeway takes the cake. it's survival of the fittest. There's really no other way to put it.
bad,"Bad, was forced to work overtime (off the clock) every night. Either I stayed two hours after on the clock or clocked out right at 10 (when I was supposed to). They were very upset about that and threatened to slash my hours. All of the other deli clerks would trash the place and expect me to clean up WHILE tending to customers at the same time. Hazardous work environment."
bad,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMANY!!!!!!! I DONT CARE HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE FOR A CHECK IT IS NOT WORTH THE PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL ABUSE YOU WILL ENDURE BY THE MANAGEMENT TEAM. You will be working 50+ hours a week as a manager, be talked about negatively by other managers, they will say rude things to your face and turn all members of management against you. Once they all hate you they will start giving you bad working hours in order to break you physically and mentally so that you eventually quit. There is NO TRAINING PROGRAM, they throw you in your store for ""training"" but in reality they use you as a high end stocker, cleaner, merchandiser, customer service clerk, make you fry chips along with chicken in the deli, package pastries in the deli, stock all frozen and dairy products, lift pallets and broom and mop the floor as if your a maid. YOU ARE HIRED AS A MANAGER BUT IN REALITY YOU ARE AN INDENTURED SERVANT AND JUST ANOTHER BODY FOR THEM TO USE. ON TOP OF THE PHYSICAL PAIN THEY VERBALLY ASSAULT YOU ANY CHANCE THEY GET AND TRY TO BULLY YOU INTO ""RESPECTING THEM AS MANAGERS"". THIS IS A HIGHLY STRESSFUL PLACE TO WORK AND 3 OUT OF 4 EVERY NEW HIRE QUITS WITHIN 1 MONTH OF BEING HIRED.PLEASE RUN AWAY!!!"
bad,no transparent department policy /always follow what other company does-never leads/upper management not in harmony with one another/ no work ethics or interpersonal relationships/ cutthroat workplace /no lunch break/cares only sales
bad,"Constant pressured to do a three persons job. They were understaffed and were cutting staff hours. It would get so bad. We could only fill prescriptions as customers arrived. Back log got to a week behind. So much stress on the team there was no team. "
bad,Worked there a long time ago and it was horrible. Bad management. Not enough employees scheduled. Dirty stores. Constant outages and unhappy people...
bad,No set days off. Overly worked. I went from part time to full time without my knowledge. They cross train you because they lack employees. You don’t get breaks unless you beg for it. Your lunch is rushed because they usually need you back up front.
bad,"Management is horrible. Promised hours but they lie. The department I worked for, the manager is sexist. He gives into men but makes the women work harder."
bad,wouldn't let me transfer to a store closer to home had no choice to quit no set schedule was always late to second job all around poor company to work for.
bad,"Worst job I ever had, management treats employees very poorly. No opportunity for advancement or better pay every one stars at minimum wage regardless of experience."
bad,Very low paying job at minimum wage and takes years to get a wage increase. Never get full time hours. Very high paced and stressful work. Management does not care about employees.
bad,"Safeway does have many great people that work there and many great employees, but the management is not consistent and neither is any of the employees schedules or hours."
bad,"My employer was not willing to be understanding and considerate that I had a disability. She was not supportive in keeping me employed at Safeway. I was given 2 days of training. It was not enough training. I felt that if I had been given more training and had support from my supervisor I would still be at this company."
bad,"Terrible place to work, People are pushy with female coworkers, Management was horrible, I wouldn't even wish it on my worst enemies. Do not work here!"
bad,This is the worst job ever manager yells and screams at customers and demand you do work whenever she want you to. This job's OK for college student working their way through college the step to go to other jobs for some experience
bad,"They do not care about their employees at all. If you have children, don't even bother applying. They will make you choose between caring for your child or having a job."
bad,Everyone of these stores is extremely cliquish people will cut deals no matter what you do  you management has a habit of singling people out and making things as hard as they can for them and treats everyone like trash in general the courtesy clerk vests stink of sweat because they haven't been washed in who knows how long..wouldn't be working here if i didn't need the money..
bad,"Management was not consistent. They ensured that personnel did not make the full time status, to not require giving the full benefits.  Union issue caused me to be paid less than others that came in after, though I was doing more work."
bad,"Don't expect to anything more than working at safeway, from working at safeway. It won't get you anywhere except further down a rabbit hole. Not a viable place to work and support a family."
bad,Thanks again for all the help and support to learn how to use the help. I applied for this position as I can get it for all the money for my relocation.
bad,I used to work full time for safeway but since a year ago in August I had my hours cut because of a second job. But no raises or anything. Nothing has changed since I've worked here for 4 years now.
bad,"truth be told its not a bad first job, but if you can avoid it, i strongly suggest that you do. horrible management across the board unless the CEO comes in town. Never again"
bad,"The manger was sexist and an all around jerk. Terrible hours, not flexible, inconsistent, and inconvenient. The customers are nice but that’s the only part of the job to look forward to."
bad,Management does not appreciate employees and does not provide a good work environment. Hours varied from full-time to below part-time. Getting vacation days was near impossible and management refused to work with employees on getting more training or switching positions.
bad,"Honestly, it was not a good experience while I worked at Safeway. I was constantly mocked by one of my older coworkers and no one would do anything about the situation. They also under paid me and only gave me 12 hours a week."
bad,"The deli manager is an incompetent, lazy slob that takes little to no initiative, or responsibility for his faults and jobs. "
bad,In our area we've had employees attempt or commit suicide due to the poor treatment from their managers. Other employees have been denied leave even diagnosed with cancer or other medical emergencies regarding their health or even their own children. No one should have be sick and worried when their life is going to end because a Job that allows leave doesn't want to grant it so the individual could receive treatment in a timely manner.
bad,this place was poorly run and i was fired because they changed the scheduled without telling me and it was all done in pencil like we were in grade 5. i would never work there again id rather be homeless. awful awful job
bad,"Busy all day. "
bad,"Worst job I've ever had. Never hated going to work as much as I did well working here. Awful management although as long as you don't show up drunk, or steal from the company you for the most part have job security."
bad,"This is the worst place of employement in my career. Management is all men and treat women differently. If you don't conform to their un-ehticial ways, they will find a reason to fire you."
bad,"Safeway only offer you 14 hour a week. You cook,clean,customer service, dishwasher,pot and pans,ovens"
bad,"As a Pharmacy manager you will be treated like a piece of dirt by the store director at certain stores. They are your boss, and they may feel threatened by your Salary and education and look to control you with their power. Gossip & slander are an everyday thing creating a hostile work environment."
bad,"Working at Safeway is a terrible experience. Management is lazy and uncooperative. The turnover rate is immense, one week I had seven coworkers walk out. Pay is abysmal at best. Don't expect to get time off even if you request it months in advance."
bad,When I was working there I felt like I was a sheep that was being herded and the place was always filthy and the management didn't do any thing about people that were stealing. and they didn't let the coworkers go after them because the didn't want to be held responsible if thy got hurt.
bad,did not like walmart as it was not a god learing experenice I only worked 2 a week and did not have fun but it did teach me to be fast and to be friendly
bad,"My experience with Safeway was terrible.  I had a racist manager who had questionable hiring practices and no respect for those he hired. I was forced into a Union that did nothing for it's workers and given little to no hours.  The entire work environment was cut throat.  I seen people thrown under the bus all so someone else could move up to a simple cashier position. Constantly we were asked to perform outside our job description without compensation, and if someone refused retribution was common in the form of hours being cut.   I decided to leave when I received a 0.00 dollar pay check due to Union Dues which I could not pay.  I wouldn't wish this ""job"" upon any person."
bad,It was a horrible place to work they treated all of their employees horribly and all of the customers saw that and commented on it daily one of the customers actually gave me the idea to leave
bad,"Every day that I had to see my manager was the worst day of the week. She would forget to excuse me from my breaks, encourage other employees to be mean to me, and was overall a sociopath for no reason other than she did not like my face."
bad,My typical day of working at safeway was to clock in make sure my register is clean and ring up customers bag there merchandise and also try to be friendly with the customers. I hated management .
bad,"Did not like working here. The pay was very low. I got written up for being late once in 2 years. Do not recommend working here. Store manager was fired for sexually harassing underage employees, dangerous to work here late at night.. (not after close obviously)"
bad,Got my hours cut because the bakery manager didn't like that I was getting decorating training. Didn't tell me at the time. All managers and supervisors were like this. There's no loyalty.
bad,I did not like this job it is very fast paced and you are not paid for everything that you do. Honestly I would not go back even if I had no option left
bad,When hired they promised you basically the world and that you'd be able to advance quickly into better positions with better pay. None of anything they said were true.
bad,"I was stuck working by myself all the time, no breaks my lunch would be spent in the kiosk having to wait on customers while on my lunch hour. The corporation could care less about you, and they tell you , if you leave someone is there to take your place! I would NOT recommend working there, they play favorites, they let the people that they favor take extra breaks and do whatever they want."
bad,this ob was okay no need to say anything about it it was a job so that why  i would not go back the pay is not good either but it was not bad for the time being
bad,"Poor management. Pay is not worth the hours they expect you to work. Stressful days with very minimal help. Fast paced, expectations are very high. Various depts needed to know minimal."
bad,Working at safeway was my first job. This was the lowest paying job I ever had. Started at $7.30 a hr then got a $0.50 cent raise after months of working there.
bad,"Employer(s) are demanding, which creates a stressful workplace environment, hours are inconsistent, and there’s little to no chance of advancement within the company."
bad,"This is one of the worst companies to work for, if you want to work here for 13 years and live below the proverty  level then apply. The back of the house  is unorganized and dirty. That is were they store your food. 90% of the employees  don't care about the customers, they care about just having a job.  Poor management,  poor quality and poor judgment . Try another merger to bale you out of this deadbeat business."
bad,There is a lack of opportunity for you to build a career.  This particular location was based off of who you know instead of the work you do.  Popularity was more important than work ethic
bad,"this job wasnt great. I never got enough hours. I had no oppertunity for advancement, every time i tried to get training to get a promotion i was bursh off."
bad,I was never happy at work. I was treated poorly by customers and management and not taken seriously for my work. I learned customer service at Safeway.
bad,I've worked at safeway before and this store by far has the worst management you will encounter. Mangers pass off all their work to whoever is not busy as they do nothing. Hostile work environment where checkers will complain to managers if you do not assist them bagging even though that is not your responsibility.
bad,"I ask for more hours and didn't get it . Ask if I can go to another department and was dined. More responsibility then the other in my department ,that all I can say."
bad,"Place sucks, don't work there. There if its for a short time. The place is very depressing, everyone on there will back stab you or are two faced. Too much drama!"
bad,They will suck the life out of you. Expect too much out of their employees and managers are jokes! They don't respect time off and they don't show recognition.
bad,You are going to regret it. They disrespect and belittle their staff. The pay is not enough to live off of and the conditions are horrible. THe only saving grace is the discount
bad,It took so long for them to get back to you! You always had to call them to track down the Recruiting person. They need to improve on that. The people they had Hired  their are very poor at there Personality. They can Definitely improve On how they Hire people.
bad,"I prefer not comment on the end of my twenty eight years at Safeway. I enjoyed the people and customers and most of the experiences that I had . Since Safeway was bought out by Sobeys, the store and morale has been diminished"
bad,"Come work at Safeway if you want to hear the same repetitive horrible 80's soundtrack every shift, while getting paid minimum wage, and your hours change every week, hoping every week that they don't randomly decide to cut hours. "
bad,"Stressful place ,not a pleasant environment .they dont seem to care about you. They do not care about your life needs and will schedule you without taking anything into consideration .Management is not interested . Couldnt wait to get out of there.friends who tried working there said the same thing"
bad,he just doesn't care and is rude and all the workers are rude they don't have any type of professionalism. there was a lot of drama here and everyone was talking bad about the lead.
bad,This company is not a good company to work for. The company puts a lot of pressure on employees to perform with hardly any resources and is always cutting hours. It's very stressful to work at the company.
bad,"I worked here for almost four years and in that time I received several promotions and a pay raise of only one dollar. They gave me an ultimatum when I was in school, either work full time and quit school or I would be terminated. I was never respected there and was paid INCREDIBLY POORLY."
bad,when i worked for Safeway it sucked i was giving 4 hours a week and being paid 16$ every week and only scheduled 4 hours so its not worth it and had terrible management in Cottage Grove Oregon
bad,"Very little work "
bad,"This was my first job ever, and the job was just a job to make money. I do not have anything to say about this company because I worked here because my parents made me get a part-time job at 15 (:"
bad,"Good place to Start for Teens fresh out of high School,co workers and management can make or break your day,Food and snacks are  provided in the break room when management is pleased with everyone doing their part on keeping their Store in the top standings."
bad,"it was a good company before, now it's just another retail nightmare.  too much hours cut, no support, pharmacists need more help and this is just not safe"
bad,"I needed a job and Safeway hired me, however the management at the time wasn't the greatest. Their idea of training wasn't great, and if you worked nights they didn't train you. However, some of the members did end up working with were great."
bad,Safe way have many advantages and thus educate you a lot. It enables you to know how to welcome customers and also help them locate an item.Its always good for beginners.
bad,store managers are the worst and don't care for their employees the ones that they get a bonus off of . They are the real meaning of a p.o.s!! They love to hold your job over your head so their isn't any job security in this company.
bad,"It is tough to work in a place where company culture requires coworkers to report every transgression to your manager.  If I came in and needed to change into uniform clothes, someone would report to my manager that I was there - but Out of Uniform.... before I even clocked in."
bad,The deli department lack organization.  Did not have enough clerks to handle customers requests or orders.  As a deli clerk you are also required to mop/scrub the floor and wash enormous trays.
bad,"It was a very boring job. You would think that with t being boring that it would be ok, but it is so dead that it isn't even fun. Would not recommend anyone works here unless you are desperate."
bad,"This is a fairly easy place to work and anyone can do the work. Generally flexible hours, you start at minimum wage and get raises based on the number of hours worked total, not how well you do your job. If you are doing a bad job, they dont tell you, they just give you less hours and move you to a department that no one likes."
bad,"Work environment was chaotic to say the least and at the stores I worked in, I was harassed by both co-workers and customers and supervisors did nothing when I reported it. I would not recommend anyone to work at Safeway."
bad,Not an uplifting environment kind of depressing and expect you to be there 24/7 always 9 hours shifts. Management was rude and disrespectful and it was a terrible uncleanliness to it
bad,"Inconsistent shifts  , long nights and early morning . Very difficult for part time students to maintain such  crazy schedule . The Management were somewhat understanding about the situation. The hourly rates wasn't worth it, on top of the poor benefits and the ridiculous union fees every month.  It made it very hard to make a living with that kind of salary."
bad,"Pay increases were minuscule, pay was abysmal to start, and between healthcare and union dues, I was working well below what to expect from an area with a higher minimum wage than federal levels. I love unions, but the union I was in was only concerned with due fees and not the several OSHA violations and working conditions many co-workers faced in the workplace."
bad,"Safeway is not friendly to their employees, they are looking for profit which is understandable but they have no like for their employees, I feel that they think their employees don't do their jobs the only thing I ever saw was the employees worked very had and were not be thanked for their efforts"
bad,"Often not up front with work schedules and job requirement with candidates.  The union environment controls the work flow of the business, leaders have no say so."
bad,Upper management of Safe Sucks and they have no idea what they were doing. Very lousy management and organization from CEO dow to my level. That is why that compay was sold out
bad,"The manager was unorganized. Spent most of the day cleaning the floors, stocking shelves and bagging groceries for shoppers. My coworkers were friendly"
bad,"The is speaking just for the Deli department at Safeway nearest my location. Management was really bad. A lot of things would be reported to HR but would go unnoticed. Toxic place to work. Any other department is fine, just the deli is the rotten apple in the bundle."
bad,"Well the first issue was not knowing your hours until the very day of when you were supposed to work. Lousy wages, poor management, mentally challenged workforce and customers."
bad,They over work and under appreciate and under pay and are all to willing to work you into the ground then refusr to pay you and they will drop you the first chance they get
bad,"I disliked working there. The hours are horrible. Management is unwilling to advance. There is absolutely no room for growth. If you have a family, forget it. They dislike one having children."
bad,"If you want to be under paid, over worked. and mistreated daily, then this is a perfect job choice. You are only a number instead of a valued employee. No matter how hard you work. it is never enough and they do not appreciate what you do and the sacrifices you make for the company."
bad,"Mangers was terrible never enough hours ,manger always complain about everything. The whole experience was terrible they call n discus work when your off the clock"
bad,"The manager isn't great, the work place isn't perfect. The pay is bad and the managers take advantage of their employees. No security and the managers are rude. A typical day at work would be jumping from job to job with no help and no idea what to do. I barely learned anything from working at Safeway. The management doesn't do their jobs. The management never does their jobs properly. The workplace culture isn't great, rude people and disrespect from everyone. The hardest part of the job is having to do everything myself. I even had to do managers jobs for them because they didn't want to do them. So they told me to do it. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to see my co workers that are actually nice."
bad,"I have worked for Safeway for several years. They do not appreciate their employees and are very degrading. They do not do any training to promote their employees within or to succeed in their current positions. I do not recommend being employed by this company. You are constantly short staffed, will go 4 hours without a single break, and get yelled at for a line of customers when you are the only one on staff. Department managers will disappear for hours with no word to employees where they will be."
bad,There's a lot i could say about the time i spent working at Safeway but i think most of it is summed up in the fact that less then 12 hours after seeing my grandfather die i was told I needed to come into work regardless of the situation. No compassion. Also schedules were set on a weekly basis and would change frequently so there was no way to plan something ahead of time.
bad,"One of the strangest employment experiences I have ever had. Took me off the schedule without notice."
bad,Working here builds your tolerance for arrogance. There are no good visits or moral- boosting communications. The 'backstage' and store operations do not get along or coordinate tactful demands.
bad,alot of hours and overtime great work lace nice people take good care of their customers and love all their foood great customer service and the pay is very nice
bad,"Very busy and stressful at times. Prolong standing, walking and constantly on the move. Direct contact with shoppers to solve customer concerns. I'm also involved in checkout service to reduce grocery lines."
bad,They switch managers every 3 months and they treat their employees very poorly and the union is no help. They favor certain employees and the spread of rumors and hostility between employees is unbearable.
bad,We were always underpaid and short staff. Management was never around except to tell you that you were not good enough. Hours were very low and pay was bad. It was nearly impossible to get time off without them cutting your hours.
bad,"if you want to make minimum wages thats a great place for you to work, and work your but off than you are fine place for you to work for nothing and be criticized for everything you do"
bad,Terrible place to work. No reliable hours per week. Must come in on own time to pick a schedule but have no idea when senior co-workers will pick their schedule so you can pick yours.Schedule changes without notice. Micromanaged one minute and left to figure out next minute. No positive reinforcement. A good day is being unnoticed. No incentive to achieve. Pay raises random. Poor performers get department positions.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend Safeway as a job career. There is a lot of negatives and not to many positives. The work environment wasn’t the cleanest and the mangager wasn’t very nice.
bad,"never have I worked in a union atmosphere  so this  was totally new ground for me , I thought the Union was there to help you it was there to help the  union reps and not employees"
bad,Safeway is a very fast paced place to work with high expectations of their employees with little compensation on top of union dues no matter how many hours you get.
bad,To much favertisum so it makes it a bad place to work for . You have to be in good with there little click or else you will be the black sheep in the bunch .
bad,"If you're looking for a job to fill a gap or something go ahead and apply here but honestly even if you apply for full time they'll probably give you full time, schedule you 1-3 days a week as needed and then hire someone else in your spot and cut your hours completely. As a Bakery Clerk on the night shift you basically work alone, you work on a very strict time frame expected to spend most of your day packaging leftover baked goods, baking new bread, and spending the last 2 hours of the day cleaning and closing everything in the area. clean all machines, all pans, sweep and mop floors, and even the dishwasher itself needs to be cleaned out every day. if there's a lot of packaging that needs to be done you're probably going to have to put most of it in storage for the morning shift to take care of otherwise you won't have time to finish cleaning procedures."
bad,"It is good only if u are a student or looking for temporary job."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Safeway. The hours were horrible and training was not good either. I felt that they don't care about their employees. Especially working part- time and no raise until you work over 2,000 hours."
bad,"This was the worst place, that I've ever worked. The ""Upper Management"" was aweful, other employees were nice and we got along really well. We went through more Management than regular employees."
bad,"Was a courtesy clerk and it was terrible. You're basically there to only follow orders and clean. Management is terrible, staff terrible, everything is terrible."
bad,Worst job I have worked at they never trained me properly or even gave me  hours Management  was always upset or never happy certain staff members were very disrespectful to a older generation
bad,"Last resort employment, incompatible schedules, low pay, poor benefits, lack of advancement opportunities, poor local and corporate  management by some of the managers."
bad,Not enough help! Then you get threatened if you can’t finish your work. Too many chiefs! Not enough Indians! Management knows nothing about the business.
bad,"This is a good job if you just need a quick buck, but don't make it your life time career. They will work you to death. They do not care about no on. Money money money is all they care about"
bad,"I work in the produce department preparing all of the fresh fruit and vegetables. Management cuts hours and they expect to keep the same production numbers with less hours. When you present ideas to management to improve production I was ignore. Management is always stress out and screaming at their employees. Safeway needs to invest in some management classes for their managers. This has been my experience working at Safeway Located in Clayton Concord, CA. zero employee appreciation."
bad,division with union reps and company issues rules always changing company sets expectations way to high for the employee. managers are rude and cut throat.
bad,"Only worked here for three months due to the environment created by management and the pay scale. Here again, a company pushing current employees to do the work of three rather than have the number needed to accomplish all that they required on a day to day basis. There was nothing pleasant about working for this company at all and I could not wait to leave."
bad,I never received enough hours and the pay wasn't very good considering I had to pay $22 in union dues and didn't get any benefits. I also worked on holidays and only got an extra $1 for my time.
bad,"This job sucks, there is no free food so you have to work around all this free all the time and you aren't allowed to have any of it. Also there are no free drinks."
bad,I learned a lot about procedures and product from my Deli Manager she had very good communication skill and a great trainer. She had many years of experience working for Safeway. The rest of the store management was chaotic they basically worked employees to the bone with no worthwhile compensation raises were nothing and there were too many chiefs.
bad,"Management never did their jobs correctly, often putting their jobs onto others. Communication between staff and managers was awful. Often it would take going through at least 3 people to get a simple task done."
bad,Bad place to work very dirty and nasty the managers are complete jerks terrible scheduling not enough hours not getting paid for the work that is done pay rate is bad
bad,Management pretends to be oblivious/turn a blind eye.. whichever works in their favor. They're cutting labor but expect the same output. Employees work off the clock to keep numbers up. We get written up for working overtime. Don't ever be a front end courtesy clerk. The senior staff make it a point to degrade you. This job doesn't pay enough for that kind of treatment.
bad,People were unfriendly. Never enough hours. Customers were rude. Manager was always behind and taking stress out on employees. No benefits and had to pay way too much for union.
bad,The management at all levels are incompetent and bullies and you never get any hours. Since Safeway was bought out all the employee perks have disappeared and Sobeys is trying to take away all contract benefits. The second you walk through the door you have an overwhelming feeling of depression and when you leave you pray that you never have to return.
bad,No communication and after a few months I was let go without a reason and was making sure produce was on the shelves and the shelves were stocked up for the customers.
bad,"Always busy,  work never appreciated. Food workers union did not work hard enough to better salaries or handle employee's complaints. Very high employee turn over. Poo management at store level."
bad,I had a bad time working here just in general no one did there job managment did nothing and asked you to do things you shouldint have to do like climb in a dumbseter
bad,The worst place ever. The manager was awful. The company paid you practically nothing. I hated every moment of my life. Soul sucking. You have been warned.
bad,Verbally discouraged by management. Lied to about hours available to you. Unrealistic goals. Under staffed. Lack of equal respect. Treated as tho you lack education.
bad,"Not only does the management create a horrible environment for the employees, or at least the ones who are not from this small town, but they also seem to forget they they are also employees for Safeway just like the rest of us. I have never in my life been treated by any employer the way I have been treated by the management at Safeway. I am extremely disappointed in my experience there. I guess this is the trend at Safeway, since I have heard the same thing from other friends who also work for Safeway at other locations."
bad,Working here was fun in the beginning. but the union will not work for you until you have been with the company for 5 years horrible union. They do not stand behind their employees.
bad,"Turn over rate is extremely high, causing chaos on a regular basis. The management did not have the right characteristics to be successful in this environment."
bad,Gave me less than 8 hours per week. made me drive 30 minutes to work for a two hour shift and another 30 minutes back home in traffic. My paychecks only went to pay for their union.
bad,Safeway isn’t worth your time. I worked a summer here and it was the least rewarding experience I have had. In retrospect there were so many better opportunities.
bad,"I would not recommend working at safeway I didn't like the way I was treated. I always had to work holidays, they would never give me one off when I asked for it. I didn't even get to have my birthday off of work. The management is terrible and was the main reason why I left."
bad,"Terrible disgusting work, rude aggressive, abusive managers. Long unpredictable hours, unmotivated, unhelpful co-workers. Break room is nice but no reason to work there at all."
bad,Safeway is a poor company to work for ever since Alberstons took over. Management is more concerned about making payroll and controlling expenses than driving sales and building the business.
bad,"They wanted me to work through my lunch which was illegal and wasn’t allowed to take any breaks while Working a full shift because they were short staffed,"
bad,My mother has a lot of medical issues and I needed to constantly take time off / had to call in because my mom was in the hospital or needed me. My store mamanger told me I wasn’t ready to be an adult and couldn’t balance home & work.
bad,"the management was terrible, I hardly got a lunch when I was working, I would get sent home because I couldn't collect carts outside fast enough, they would write me up without my knowledge and then tell me about it later, they never gave me a pay raise, the workers treated you horribly as well."
bad,"It was ok to work there're just not enough hours, I worked in the bakery, I really enjoyed it. If I would have had gotten more hours I would have stayed."
bad,"Working at Safeway was not a great experience. Pay starts off extremely low and would need to work full time for years to get the top pay rate. Only problem is they do not offer full time to anyone but journeymen. A typical day consists of bickering from customers and other coworkers. Long time workers for Safeway are often feel entitled and take longer breaks and work less because they have the top pay then the workers who have only just started. Some management are easy to work with, others not."
bad,Safeway was Union Based and Oriented the same way. Bosses were screwed and Cut Throat. When is take an initiative it was meant with scales and discontent.
bad,"Poor management, low pay, takes forever to become a journeyman, low benefits, and a lot more. I swear working there is like being in a cut-throat high school where bullies, drama, and popularity are the norm."
bad,Very toxic atmosphere. People always bickered among one another rather than working as a team. Constant customer complaints about being ignored or hearing foul language. Management was awful and didn't care about their subordinates. Very sexist towards women.
bad,"Trying to get everything done within time period while being pulled in every direction."
bad,"Work week started when I first started working here at 40 hours then slowly decreased unable to let workers able to live. "
bad,"Hate this place point blank. no paid time off horrible pay horrible management. No overtime. treated poorly associates are not hard workers,never full 40hours"
bad,Greeting customers and show where the products are and take the time with customers. Get the food ready to prep before hand. Stocking the products and rotating by expiration dates. Check the labels and packages make sure it safely for customers.
bad,"Don't work here, there isn't a lot of benefits, they are not flexible, if they don't like you they just will stop giving you hours until you are forced to leave so that they don't have to pay you unemployment."
bad,"Horrible experience, No good hours rude manager. rude employees and rude customers. Employeees can get attacked at any time. No security on site at any time"
bad,their isn't  really nothing to say about this job. I did not enjoy working here at all. Way to much drama. Nobody was communicating with each other. I don't recommend anyone working here.
bad,"I have worked at Safeway for 18 years and just recently quit because I couldnt take it anymore and I don’t recommend anyone applying for this job. When I first started in 2000 they were a good company but have since cut back on benefits and pay, trying to compete with Walmart and Target. New hires will never make as much as I did or have as good of benefits. Management doesn’t care about the employees. They are all about top dollar. The culture of the company is awful. It’s all about each person for themselves. Employees  there are bitter and rude to customers and each other. It’s a hostile and terrible environment to be in. Please don’t work here for the love of everything, save yourself and those you love."
bad,"They do not meet any needs except their own. Job and life balance is none, it's either what Safeway or as the employees call it Slaveway wants or they cut your hours so you can barely survive so you have to grovel for hours. I have never been in a less friendly staffed environment in my life."
bad,workers are not really appreciated. I worked there for 2 months and I never felt appreciated by management. you are forced to join a union and I always feel that should be optional.
bad,"Not a good place to work at all. if your thinking about working here, run fast! Good luck making a decent living, they will cut you back to nothing and not feel one bit bad."
bad,"Safeway is a horrible place to work, was paid Federal minimum wage, horrible hours no pay raise, poor managers unorganized, not friendly managers, upside was a 10% discount"
bad,"The management is terrible, they don't give enough hours to nobody. You'll make 30 dollars a week, they would want you to get karts while its pouring down raining"
bad,"horrible management, they do not want to work around a school schedule. There is no life outside of work. They have corporate visits all the time so be prepared to work overnight 10 plus hours with no appreciation. I don't recommend working for this company at all, take your chances at mcdonalds. The only good part was there is room to grow but they don't appreciate anything."
bad,Managers are awful and have no respect for who works there. they dont treat anyone fairly and cause all of the hard working and caring people to quit.
bad,"I did not have a good time working for this company. Pay was terrible and wasn't worth it in the end. Management is sub-par at the most. Don't expect to get promoted, even if you work your absolute hardest."
bad,"They don't care anything about their employees, health or otherwise. If you are sick you are harassed by the managers. You have no life work balance and corporate makes decisions that very negatively impact employees."
bad,"The management for this job is extremely terrible, there is no general communication, lack of help and overall they show no appreciation. The hours are terrible and they do not care to add any to your pay"
bad,"the job paid very little, was demanding, but no room to advance financially or in position. Very short staff. no recognition. Don't feel like i grew much. Not a lot of learning or training."
bad,The manager that I had was very stressful. Very mean and not very understanding that I was a employee in training. They just left me by myself while I had a line of customers and didn't know what I was doing.
bad,"Hours were all over the place and no one ever really helped you move up, if you couldn't certain days because of school, they would take you off the schedule."
bad,"This is a horrible company and culture to work for, they have no regards for the workers below the offices nor the people in the offices. Their is no question why this company is destined to fail in the time coming"
bad,very slow paced and lots of busy work. Some employees were very nice and fun to work with. But employee morale was always low and there was a lot of in fighting.
bad,"The day to day was easy. Come in and prepare packaged food with little to no supervision. But they had completely inefficient workplace systems and horrible management. The job wasn't hard but whatever you did, it wasn't enough. They refused to hire more help and poorly trained me when I was hired.  They expect you to put in more work than they are willing to pay you for. Wasn't willing to work with your schedule unless you gave them at least two weeks in advance to figure it out. But then they'd forget your revised schedule anyway."
bad,"The guidelines were simple but the co-workers were unreliable, gossiping, and never completed their assigned tasks. A lot of the times, they'd just walk off and go home. the manager took out all of her frustrstions on the crew every night and the facility is infested with roaches"
bad,"This store is located in a very small town so corp, dose not come often,  so all managers get away with so much underhanded stuff they are also union locale 555 witch is no better in there position for the workers"
bad,it could be better lack of hours and need to get paid more for bs. there is always a fight over more hours and always looking at the new schedule because senority is not important . it is based on availability
bad,"I hated this job with a passion poor management the staff were not that great either"
bad,Had to leave because the store manager was very harassing. Never wanted to work on nights. Got promoted as a checker an was happy an was looking forward to a raise. Never got one. And have been working full time on nightcrew for a year making $350 a week at the most when everyone else is making $700-$800/week
bad,"there are better grocery stores to work at. management is greedy and not forgiving. overall not a good experience, maybe recommended for younger kids."
bad,Come in and get yelled at for something someone else did. I learned absolutely nothing. The management was Horrible. The workplace culture...there wasn't any. The hardest part of the job...just being there. There was no enjoyable part of the job.
bad,Poor management and extremely dirty working conditions where I didn't feel comfortable serving food out of our kitchen. Gross. No management and constant bickering between everyone. Don't waste your time here.
bad,would never work there again. Did not enjoy working for this company I no longer shop at this company. I mean what more do u want me to say about a company who does not care about thier employees.
bad,"Management could have been better. Training wasn't completed with full understanding of department, lack of correct tools for department. Outdated system."
bad,This was only a temp job but it was horrible managers where constantly changing along with new rules and policies. Coworkers where next to useless and would call out constantly. Good work went un-noticed
bad,"I would not recommend this position to an enemy let alone a friend.  Management really does not know what they are doing ""Trev"" Store Manager.  He does not know how to treat his employees.  The good employees that work hard are given everything to do while the lazy employees are overlooked and given nothing to do."
bad,Stressful environment created from management.  It's hard enough to work with the public each day but having to deal with awful management makes it unbearable.
bad,"Going to work at 3:00 a.m. in the morning was not my cup of tea.  To many of the staff would not adhere to the responsibility of their duties. They would constantly try to put their duties on someone else, especially on the weekends, so, they could get off early."
bad,"I would clock in, talk to the store manager about the plans for the day. Often i would find myself stuck in the check stand due to being short staffed. I would make sure that everyone would get their breaks and lunches on time. I would clean up around the store, receive daily deliveries, and resolve any problems that came up in the store."
bad,"The management treated you like slave labour, and if you stood up for yourself they found any reason to terminate your employment with them just before you probational period was up.  "
bad,"I would never work at Safeway again, the customers are friendly, and some employee's but the management only look out for themselves, they do not care about their employee's. they only do what they can  to get themselves  a bonus."
bad,"My direct manager was okay, and there some people there that were awesome to work with; we're still friends. But the company, similar to many non-tech companies, looks at technology as a necessary evil, emphasis on evil. Additionally, in my particular situation, it was a hostile work environment, with one employee who would never be retained in most professional companies."
bad,Management cared more about numbers than their employee's. The Union had a blind eye to all the issues in the stores. This cost the store a hard working loyal employee.
bad,"always had fun working at safeway. Bakery was okay to work with, I worked by myself every night. The harsdest thing about the job was dealing with other employees who they didn't need to work."
bad,"Horrible experience! Worst job ever! Slaved away...over worked and under appreciated big time! Almost everyone else who worked around me seemed depressed because they are stuck in that job. Old equipment shoots bread crumbs out in my face, no utensils to scoop berry filler in to donuts, no utensils to move hot deep fried donuts from pan to pan. I doubt they would pass a health inspection..all the things going on there. Ridiculous! I got injured and they refused to acknowledge it and help me out with payment and physio costs. It was a complete disaster!"
bad,"Management is horrible. Very difficult to work with the new management. Old managers created a fun environment, the new management should not be managers."
bad,hired me as a janitor at less than liveable hours even though i had experience as a cashier. When a customer was harassing me they fired me without getting my side of the story.
bad,they still use systems from the 80s and the management is terrible . the pharmacy manager was a mean pharmacist who didnt wana move or do anything besides verify rxs
bad,"Really have not enjoyed my time at Safeway Pharmacy. They call it Slaveway for a reason. I never got breaks, and my boss was a psycho! She would breathe down my neck all day and then yell at me for not getting anything done!"
bad,I learned  something about that store .ill will never see it the same. the customers are amazing and very chatty.No comments on management.the thing that i miss the most is the fresh bread.
bad,"no one who works there is treated well our store manager was awful very rude and disrespectful , the even cut hours if you were sick or got hurt or didnt want to come in on a day off"
bad,"i believe that a typical day at work can be stressful. i learn alot of things there because  you have to. the management is not that good at all, like something happends and you report it they dont move a muscle. i have nothing to say about workplace culture. hardest part of the job is been by yourself and doing everything when you have customer services to deal with. the most enjoyable part of the job is when is time to go."
bad,"I was never given a raise when I was promoted. The managers would say that they submitted the paperwork and that there was nothing more to do. The store needs new managers. You constantly have to fix the schedule because they always mess up. The job isn't hard but management sucks. After quitting, I never received my paid vacations or sick hours. Been months already and I am still waiting to get paid."
bad,"boring place, staff isn't very friendly, management isn't the nicest to deal with. everyone always seems to be in a bad mood when you go shopping there"
bad,"Half-decent place to apply. Seniority really takes a major part/role in this company. If you are a student, or need a part-time job, this would be perfect."
bad,"Although I worked for Safeway for 5 years, it was not a place I enjoyed.  The Management was not flexible and fresh ideas were not appreciated.  I do not recommend this company."
bad,"In this job, be expected to be worked hard. You'll be hating your job by the 1st month. Not a very rewarding job but work is work. Would highly not recommend working here."
bad,Safeway was a really bad job. I was not treated fairly at all. I was told by my box that I was not efficient to move up. The hours were horrible and the pay was even worse.
bad,All around terrible place to work. No matter what position you apply for be prepared to be a cashier and only a cashier.  You'll be over worked and barely any time off on a regular basis. But every Friday you get paid.
bad,Working at Safeway was a mix of negative emotions for me because if I needed help learning how to do something I would get completely ignored. As well as the fact that I was only paid $9.50 an hour
bad,Bad management. No available advancement opportunities. Incredibly unprofessional employees and management all around. The union protects the worst employees from ever getting in trouble for bad and lazy work.
bad,"Hard working , with no help stressful and lack of communication, most of the time managers do not know how to do their job and they go to employees to do it and help out"
bad,A day consisted of cutting and preparing fruit for customers inside the store. The management was insufficient. I did not enjoy working for Safeway. Nothing was enjoyable.
bad,Safeway company does not care about their employees management bullies you and if you're sick don't plan on calling out because they pretty much force you to come to work.
bad,"Sliced my hand at work, blood was all over the place  but nothing was done. I had to be picked up by family and taken to the emergency room and then my manager expected me to work the next day even with my doctors note."
bad,"A typical day at work varied from day to day depending on where they wanted to place me. either cutting meats and cheeses for customers while getting salads and pastas for them. or making sandwiches and frying chicken. In this experience I didn't learn much. "
bad,"I like workin the Bakery. It's a stressful environment. Ppl talking bout ppl. Manger's show favoritism. We make minimum wage. Part timers only get 4 hours a day, to do 12 hour work in. Shaking my head. Manger's telling employees business and it's jus a crazy work environment"
bad,Hated working there. Management was terrible. Employees did whatever they wanted. A lot of favoritism. Some got away with things that others would get fired for.
bad,The safe way manager there was boring and didnt do alot to help the store progress in to any thing greater that backed up cash registers and angry customers.
bad,didn't like management. They mocked me when I had to quit to go back to college. They ran the store in a very average way. Can i be done with this yet?
bad,"Minimum wage, no advancement, work schedule is posted 2 days in advance for the next week. Management is toxic."
bad,"The management is very bad, pay is minimum wages, no extra hours, favortizema to certain employes, new employees get crispy hours, treat you like slaves. Don't work there not worth it."
bad,"The work is monotonous, at least for the position I had. The managers were always upset and arguing with other managers or employees. I was afraid to speak to my managers when I had issues or questions."
bad,working for the bakery was fun because I got to make fresh brad in the mornings and bagels and donuts and other bakery idioms like cookies pie's always loved the early morning and being home at lunch time
bad,"they claim to be a team but no one there is team players , management is handled poorly , great benefits from working with them but unsafe , dangerous environments"
bad,"They demanded so much from you without rewarding yo. I gave my boss my schedule that she knew 6 months ahead and she barely looked at it and tossed it, and still wanted me to come in when I gave her my schedule."
bad,This is a good job for a teen that lives with his mom in the basement. don't get too comfortable there are better options for you when you turn 18 . believe this
bad,For such a big company the pay is not worth the work you give. Way to many managers and not enough workers. No teamwork or communication I learned I don't want to work in the grocery industry again
bad,great people managers was ok some time but not all the time safeway taught me how to manage my time and it gave me great customer service skills the the work environment was excellent
bad,Very Stressful environment. Everything has to be done now. Work 6 days a week only off on Mondays. Working every weekend. No time to spend with family. Doing alot of the work by myself.
bad,The pay is ridiculously low. The management is bad and  everyone that works there is backstabbing the other departments. They give  you  bad hours there isnt hardly anyone working there that is full time and people have been with the company for years.
bad,No seniority in the business means you don't get many hours. unless you do cashier where you stand in one place all day. you make minimum wage with 5 cent increases every like 7 months and top out pay is like 13 something.
bad,not a good company. New people every other day. Kinda sums it up. Never felt valued. nice enough people. however management didnt seem to care if you were good or just there.
bad,"very bad company to work for from every aspect that one can think of.   Poor compensation, poor benefit, substandard professional culture, toxic politics"
bad,"This was a god company to work for, unfortunately, the company is no longer trading, but i enjoyed my time working with Safeway. The work life balance was fair and there was a good bonus package."
bad,"dont work here, its awful, worst job, they dont listen to you, nothing is done there, management is the worst ive ever seen, worst company to work for."
bad,"They only care about the business, instead of the people conducting the business. Low staff, barely breaks or lunches. They wrongfully terminate and create hostile work environments."
bad,Terrible treatment of employees terrible pay too responsibilities. No chance for advancement. No job security. they want you to work full time hours but then you are not considered a full time employee.
bad,"Received, processed and handled orders at the counter, I learn how to take order and how to make order and how to communicate with customer and how to make a good cup of coffee, this is funny work for me."
bad,Low pay high turn over rate type of job no advancement alot of favoritism as long as i worked there for certasin sections would be out of order alot of young people who dont want to work
bad,"I  basically got told to figure things out on my own. Didn't get trained to close which I got stuck with doing each shift, ended up getting fired for not doing it properly.  Always asked what I could learn, if I could be taught how to make sandwiches which I either got ignored or told to just figure it out.  I always kept busy stocking things, cleaning, got accused of not and that was used as a reason to fire me. I feel sabotaged..."
bad,Management was disorganized and flat out disrespectful. They cared little about their employees. Getting time off months in advance was nearly impossible.
bad,"horrible place to work, they""ll  expect a lot of work done in the 3 hours they give you for the whole week they want you to kiss their butt  and beg them for hours everyone talks about each other they start stuff between the workers because they think that that well make them work harder if they don't like each other the managers dont set a good example they dont lead by example  they talk on there phones whlie interrupting workers while they work,  my managers don't come to work in professional work attire, they treat courtesy clerks like anything , the managers lie and harass  their employees, and they got crazy rules that they dont follow themselves you'll get  fired if you buy some thing before your break and you'll get fired if your late coming back from your break but they do it all the time plus they got favorites  so that dont stop some  workers from doing it plus they'll write you up for  just about anything so dont blink or breath  they'll also assume that you aint doing anything even if you are they'll watch you on camera helping customers then tell you aint doing noting but talking mind you that one of their main rules is customers come first  my manager told me that they can find items themselves its a whole lot more pettyness that go's on in safeway but im a just stop here good luck"
bad,Only work for this company as an absolute last last last resort. Several years of cuts have resulted in higher prices and longer lines with an ALL time low in employee moral.
bad,No set schedule. Had to hop around to all departments. Seasonal wage. Had to pay union that did nothing to stand up for rights at workplace. Only ever conceded. Management weren't organized or educated. Only positions that were full time were department managers and they were probably the worst workers. Everything else was considered part time. Union only cared about full time employees. No chance to move up at all.
bad,"Safeway was understaffed, the Deli where I worked encouraged not following the food handlers guide due to being understaffed. Manager didn't have good people skills."
bad,"I absolutely loved the people. I looked forward to seeing my regular customers. The management are liars. They promoted me to PIC. So, I did the work of a PIC but did not get the pay. I was told to come for training and instead of training I was grilled by a very mean person from asset recovery over $9.60. It was a misunderstanding. I was suspended and fired a month later. I miss the customers."
bad,"They expect you to learn everything in two weeks. Felt under constant pressure, I also felt as if they were holding a double standard for me because I'm (older). I was constantly under pressure to get ALL the carts in during my hour. Had to always go behind the younger ones and do their job since they didn't. They let me go just before I was to become a permanent employee, but they kept the younger people who have an umbilical cord tying them to their phone."
bad,this isn't a good job. the pay sucks and the hours sucks. bad experience for me and I would never recommend the job to anyone unless your in school and live with family and not paying bills.
bad,I did not like the hours. I had my hours cut from 21 - 9. When I was hired I was promised 25 hours minimum. I have never received even close to 25 hours a week.
bad,Safeway is a very dated TA group with lots of contractors and very little commitment to best practice tools & efforts.  HM treat the recruiting team with little respect.
bad,"Are you a masochist?  Have no self esteem?  Do you want to be chewed up and spat out?  Well, Safeway is the job for YOU.  We'll treat you like dirt and ask you to work even harder.  No amount of self-loathing and managerial disrespect is out of bounds."
bad,"I would score less management there was a nightmare no communication, you see new faces every week they cant keep people, advice to the new people going  in beware..."
bad,Management was irresponsible and I had to correct mistakes made by management often. There was no support when I had food poisoning and my manager would not answer her phone. The scheduling didn't work with out department but our store director wouldn't make changes.
bad,"Night crew now does the bulk of the heavy lifting."
bad,"It is a great place to work for a short time but not a place to make a career. It was a great place when I started, but then the policies and procedures flipped completely, hours were cut, and they expected you to do the work of 3+ people by yourself."
bad,"Worst job experience I have ever had. If you don't believe me,"
bad,Only good thing about working there was seeing the friends i had made while working there. Oh and leaving at the end of the day. The pay was horrible.
bad,learned management skills. Management there was lacking. Learned customer service skills. Hardest part of the job was having to work holidays and be away from my family. Not competitive pay.
bad,"Got only 4 hours a week, management horrible to customers and employees. No sense in managerial responsibilities, seen more personality from a school of lepers."
bad,"The scheduling is miserably inconsistent and the work is not gratifying. Most of the time the customers are fine, but the  vast majority of stores are horribly mismanaged, and there is an abundant lack of training for any job they have."
bad,I would not work for this company under any circumstances. The breaks were not the correct amount and the pay was absolutely terrible.
bad,"Not a good company    ,  Very unprofessional management. Lack in technology and no skill full people.        Poor benefits, no security, so many car robberies in the campus."
bad,Not a good place to work...suggested by other pharmacist not to take my lunch break many times....professionals putting blame on assistants when they are not checking properly prescriptions...
bad,"In my opinion Safeway lacks organization with their company, I feel that they focus more on small things vs bigger problems that not only effect the company but also the customers."
bad,"Be prepared to bring lots of lube to make getting screwed by this place easier. The average work day includes doing work for everyone and not receiving a simple thank you but a gracious cut in hours. The only people who get promoted are the people everyone hates cause they cant put those people anywhere else so PROMOTE THEM! Management doesn't talk to employees they simplily do there own thing which is nothing and when you don't do what they expect you get the ax, So being a mind reader is a must. Overall working for the Schutzstraffel  (SS) was not my cup of tea."
bad,"Horrible. worked 10hrs a week for $11 an hour I could afford to work there spent more money on gas to get there than I was making. "
bad,"Just a terrible place to work, they treat there employees like they are  nothing. the job its self is fun and easy, but they dont keep you on a set schedule. your always bouncing around from different shifts."
bad,"There was no clear instructions half the time, and if there were they were barked at you in front of all the customers. Terrible management, and they never give you hours."
bad,The management staff at the location gave preferential treatment to employees that went to the office to complain. There was no balance to the staff as the under achievers dominated the department. Management was often rude.
bad,I had a great personal pharmacy manager. The stores themselves have very poor management and do not take care of employees. Poor pay and not so great benefits.
bad,"The management was unresponsive, co-workers' morale was always at a constant low, they would forget to pay vacation time consecutively and offer no apology or remorse for having 'forgotten' it."
bad,"I think the job would've been better if I'd had more work experience. So really the job was probably great, but I wasn't ready for it."
bad,"Wasn't flexible with hours (had new born).Management didn't listen to problems involving verbal abuse from other co-workers. threatened to be fired if called in sick one time. Other than that great benefits and company, outside of few specific employess at this location."
bad,I don't like it because its not a fair company. because right now it treating me terrible. I work 5 days a week you supposed get 2 days of but they take your day so you work 6 and get 1 day of a week when you body need to recover 1 day its not enough. I got injured on the job and I told my issues and they seem not to care its either you come or get written up or fired.
bad,Safeway is a place to work if you are really needing a job quickly but you are worked hard and likely will not advance very fast. The employees are always cheerful and nice but management is uncaring.
bad,"After first starting with this company I was under the impression that they cared not only for the customers but for the employees instead, how ever after working there for 5 short months I learned it was quite the opposite. The deli manager (my boss) told me to extend multiple food dates on multiple perishable items and after trying to bring it to the attention of the store GM they shrugged in off in a statement that the deli manager would never do that mainly due to the fact that the deli manager had been placed there by corporate due to her having the lowest shrink percentages of any other manager and the extending of food dates would be the main reason that that would be the case."
bad,Unfortunately my employment was nothing of the word enjoyable. I am appreciative of the quick opportunity I was given but believe management had severe room for improvement. Safeway was not the type of job I found rewarding.
bad,"Typical day at work, clock in check what time to do sweeps. Bag groceries, then do sweeps and clean the rest room, then push carts then do a 2nd sweep. You don't get to talk to co workers. What i learned is that no one cares about you and you are on your own. Co workers mind there own business. The hardest part of the job is pushing carts and having to do carry outs and help customers push their heavy carts to their car. The enjoyable part of the job is just sweeping and walking around the store. But overall its not enough money to make a living. So i suggest anyone who is going to do this job. Make sure you are physically fit and if you are going to school its a good job cause its part time."
bad,Poor store management not enough hours there really nothing else too say once you have  poor management from a store employees dont want too work cause not enough hours and on top of that too have a black store manager with blonde hair that thinks she better then the next black because of her position
bad,"working at Safeway grocery store in Altamonte Springs Florida as a courtesy clerk, you will get the mot one day a week some weeks you will not be scheduled at all."
bad,"As an employee I am finding my job becoming more and more detrimental to my overall wellbeing.  Anytime we get a customer who changes their mind, or simply doesn't want something we have to call for an override; which in essence shouldn't be a problem, but management always take their time and make you feel stupid for calling them. I want this to be a good job, but I don't have a lot of faith in management at this point."
bad,"I worked at Safeway in Hilo Hawaii for about a year and a half, and the ultimate reason for leaving was the store manager. (A-hole)"
bad,"staff members are encouraged to haze new employees and make work place unsafe for training employees, unfriendly management"
bad,"I worked for Safeway in the Deli Dept. All I can say is I was not appreciated by the manager. I was always on time, never called in sick nor was i ever late.  New employees would quit or walk out the first day. Manager was always in a bad mood and would take it out on the employee. A poor lady who had been in the Deli for 12 years was scarred of management. She too was a great employee but always had the fear of what management had to say. Management would walk in at 7 am, by then I was there at 3 am had tons of things done, but was never good enough. She would walk in and say, ""Your not done yet?!"" and rolled her eyes. Everyday is different even if you knew the opening position. There were times that i was running a bit behind, but not once did management helped but was always judging . I believe in team work, you wouldn't get any team help there. She has the attitude of, Its your job!"" I quit because of her, even when I had asked to be moved to a different department. I was told that Management prevented of me leaving to a different department because she didn't have anybody else to cover my shift! Well HEELLLOOO, your the cause of nobody wanted to work for you! Upper management would not do anything about her verbal abuse. (that is what I consider, when instead of running a deli, but her attitude was running a boot camp!)"
bad,was my very first job when i was 16. had to leave because working and school were conflicting. was a good experience. managers weren't willing to help with my schedule.
bad,"was expected to handle other employees work load, some times didnt get my 15 at mid shift, and was never really treated fairly as an employee"
bad,I felt/thought that working at Safeway would've been a fun experience and a place where i would love to come to. After physically working there i noticed a lot of unprofessional activities going on.
bad,"Safeway is a very dangerous place to work. The management is the worst I have ever worked for. I have never had managers treat all of their employers like high school children. They made me feel very afraid for my job security, my private life being kept separate from my work life, and the particular position I worked in was more than often scary due to the customers I would get. Customer service/ bookkeeping is the worst job in a Safeway. Not only do they move up the salary ladder the slowest, even a courtesy clerk, they have the busiest job that pays near the littlest. If one must work at a Safeway, then I suggest making the managers your best friends ever and working in a department like the bakery or produce departments. I could go on and on about how a particular Safeway is very bad to it's employees, but I think giving them one star (because I couldn't give none) on every level does enough for them. I regret my entire career at Safeway."
bad,"Most unprofessional place I have ever worked. "
bad,"Safeway doesn't give employees very many hours, but the union dues are like $100 a month. This makes it hard to justify working here."
bad,Safeway has to be the worst company I have ever worked for they not only treat you like garbage they throw you around like it also. They are not flexible you never get an oppurtunity to become full or part time without kissing so much behind your lips are brown. You do not start with any benefits and the management is horrible.
bad,"Worked for Safeway. Was in the company for years and through all those years I was employed I seen a variety of workers quiet get discriminated or if not it was just retaliation. Its so sad how their management is. I see these company like a discrimination place.I didn't get fired I volunteered to quit it was just so much non-sense. Theirs better jobs then Safeway instead they should call it ""slaveway"". If your ready to get mistreated and have a lot of stress then be my guest and apply. Wouldn't recommended it."
bad,"Store management is terrible, and only cares about money. Not the employees or the customers, just money. Promised management the entire time I was there and it never happened. Waste of time."
bad,"Do not work for this company.  They will lie to you and tell you that you will make a certain amount per hour and when you get your first check it will be not what you were told per hour but 1.50 less.  When you ask why they tell you oh it's a mistake it will get fixed on the next check but of course no it didn't.  2 months go by, still not fixed.  They don't care if you are not able to work specific days due to other employment.  Even though, you informed them of these certain days at your interview and put them on your application.  Forget about ever getting to request a day off and get it off.  They will bump you so that managers can have the day off if they feel like it.  They treat you like you are a child even though you have the strongest work ethic out of all the employees.  I got this job as a part time job and thought it would be fun and an enjoyable place to work but with all the garbage they put you through and the lies they tell you, it is more like a slave labor job and they don't give a darn about their employees or the fact that they have lives besides working.  I refuse to even shop there anymore."
bad,No room for advancing...not even fulltime... scheduling sucks...most enjoyable part...when the shift is over..........................
bad,"They only care about the customers, and not the employees. I had a medical emergency and they expected me to finish my shift at work instead of go to the hospital"
bad,"I come into work everyday at least one-person short, management doesn't know my name without my name tag, compensation is +$.5 every 1,200 hours, no advancement opportunities, unorganized, no employee appreciation except for the occasional pizza in the breakroom. This is not the place to work if you want to be happy."
bad,"The Union Local 400 has let this company sell its workers out. The pay has been cut in half, they hire children now because adults can not afford to work for the the scraps that they pay."
bad,discrimination on martial status due to my daughter not being biological. My daughter got sick and she needed to go to hospital and some discrepancies arouse from my boss due to this.
bad,"Safeway expected alot from its employees and didnt not return the support.  Pay was aweful, hours were terrible, as well as the employees who were part of the union and felt untouchable."
bad,I was extremely disappointed at how this company functions. My manager at the time ended up getting fired after I left for a teaching job because he was making other people do his job. One of my coworkers claimed to have been sexually harassed by another coworker and claimed the manager did nothing to stop it from happening.
bad,"Safeway is a TERRIBLE company to work for.  I was lied to about my wages, my pay was cut without notice (they new about it weeks in advance and tried to hide it), and I was worked to the bone."
bad,Hated working here and would not recommend anyone to try applying here unless you definitely need to. Hours sucked management sucked pay sucked and the training was through a computer. I was expected to know how to do my job.
bad,the only think that was good about this job was some of my co workers. the management was bad. it was the worse i have ever seen.
bad,Too many  burned out negative  people  who  influence  the newer workers .   Too much work to do and hours are cut so u need to get it all done in a short amount  of  time .  Very  low pay. I am being paid what i was earning 15 years ago. It's  a  very sad sad situation .   Thanks to Albertsons  and Safeway .  We have no union in the bakery .   The only  place in the store .  So we cross union lines and do work in other sections . .........done with complaints  . Nobody  will do anything  about it.   Just want to warn u.  Pay is bad and safety  practice  is very dangerous .   Jusy be careful .   Only good thing is to use this as a stepping  stone to your next job.  God bless & good luck.
bad,A typical day at work involves micromanaging 24/7. Employees constantly getting yelled at and written up for not working fast enough even though they are working by themselves when the work actually requires multiple people to accomplish. The managers do not care about employees. They find any possible way to take raises away from you. All they care about is cutting employee hours and employee pay down to nothing so they can make their store look good by saving the most money for the company. The only enjoyable part of the job is some of the co-workers.
bad,"Lots of stress, poor managers. Lots of work for little pay. The director of pharmacy for the last few years was awful in every way. Horrible manager."
bad,"great job fast paced, Love working with the public and enjoyed working with other employee's. Hours were long was able to get 40 hours"
bad,"No career growth.  Time pressured, cannot take even the mandated 10 minutes break. Low salary. Needs more improvement in order to upgrade the sales."
bad,"At first it was a good place to work, overtime it became such a huge strain on myself. Doing more and more for the managers and they just started to take me for granted so they didn't have to do anything extra, and of course the managers look out for each other regardless of their actions and way they treat some employees better than others. Honestly every time I see someone I use to work with they ALL say the same, how much bs is going on, how much they hate it there, wish they could leave if they had another job, everyone hates that store and it starts becoming a emotional burden than a job! I know ppl need money to survive but take my word for it, you can find a less stressful job elsewhere!!! This place is a dead end, and corrupt with the higher ups inner circle. Tracy Peters is by far the worst manager I've ever worked for out of all my years!! Not even a good person!"
bad,"I could not wait to leave this place"
bad,"If you want to be treated like a second class citizen for barely enough compensation to survive then this is the place for you. Say good bye to your free will when you step through the doors because the Management honestly doesn't care about you or your mores. They don't want people working there, they want robots."
bad,"Management has no empathy or sympathy to anything going on in your personal life"
bad,I did not like this job environment I had property stolen from me and when I reported it stolen management terminated me . NOT A GOOD WORK PLACE.
bad,"It is customer service, you are an object and not a person. Your hard work is rewarded with screaming customers and your poor work is rewarded by screaming managers, you are an object, not a person."
bad,Not enough hours didn't like the new manager told her i was 7 months pregnant that i couldn't do anything and she asked if i can push carts outside even after the fact i told her i was 7 months pregnant went back to work in Feb 2014 and told her why im always late and she kept writing me up even when i tell her why wanted to transfer and they said they cant because of something and i when i came back i wasn't even on the schedule had to keep calling to when i was scheduled to work then on that my son got sick with a cold he was only a few months old like 5-6 months so i couldn't go to work i called and they fired me because i didn't want to take my son out in the cold and to slip and fall with him on ice. and on top of that i get wic and most of the stuff i wanted to get they don't have it they didn't have anything
bad,They have you do other peoples job people bring all their drama to work they're disrespectful the company pretty much takes you for granted and doesn't care
bad,I absolutely hated this place. Don't even go there! The management sucks. The people suck. I was an honest worker and I brought up an issue of harassment and they basically called me stupid.
bad,"The environment is very tense, managers constantly breathe down your back, managers are impolite, and uncaring about their employees unless they have some type of connection (I.e) (same race). This particular store that I worked for, was continuously under staffed, co-workers some were friendly and team players while some others were sneaky and lazy..."
bad,"A typical day at Safeway consists of not getting enough breaks, being made fun of for asking for breaks, and then getting yelled at when you don't say anything. That's how Safeway handles everything. Even when my grandma died they were upset that I’d have to be gone when I was scheduled and made me come in and work anyway. They get angry that students can't work all day because of school.Management is constantly panicking about not having enough employees, but never fix it. It was the most stressful job I’ve ever had. Safeway in Laramie WY is always hiring because everyone is always quitting."
bad,Hired at Pavilions in January left another major Grocery Company as Assist Manager to become a Manager in Pavilions took major pay cut temporarily while I was to be trained to Safeway standards pay raise and quarterly bonuses were promised upon completion of training. After 5 month's of slave labor doing management duties being payed courtesy clerk wages Gelson's contacted me offered me a great position with respectable pay and I immediately left Pavilions. My experience in Safeway was horrible been in the industry 25 plus years and never had I experience such a cut throat mentality many employees are blaming Albertsons merger as the major problem.
bad,the company does not care about any of the employees the place was dirty the hours were bad you can work hard and not get anywhere
bad,"I enjoyed learning about new drugs and all the variety of tasks..The hardest part of job was the math in the pharmacy and being responsible for the lives of people, management was pretty good in being approachable.  Most days were fun and I enjoyed my work schedule, but job did start to burn me out and the repetition got boring."
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this company, and neither did any of my co workers. I would never write a negative review about any company unless I felt they were not treating their employees anything less than fair. The daily tasks were set as if you were a slave to the management, who did not think their positions required them to work."
bad,Safeway is run terrible i applied for fulltime i got partime the management is horrible the people are really nice but i didn't like that i had to quit cause i was not impressed with the hours i have lost
bad,"Working at Safeway was a good experienc, a lot of walking. great job to keep myself busy and on my feet. was great working there for janitorial"
bad,Safeway doesn't provide enough hours nor pay to make a living. You would have to work two jobs just to make ends meet. All of the employees are miserable and make sure you are too. Just wasn't what I expected.
bad,"Working for Safeway was like being in a  Concentration Camp, overworked, underpaid, under appreciated,....the list goes on. I wouldn't recommend my worse enemy to apply there. Unfortunately, in hard times a person has to take whatever jobs are available."
bad,"If you like working with young thugs and ex-cons then this is the perfect job for you a total bottom of the barrel job. Terrible environment for customers and employees who are not about ""that life""."
bad,Many changes make this workplace difficult to balance. Recent sale have made hiring impossible. Grocery will teach a person to work hard for little pay!
bad,"it was so long ago I had this job the I dont remember much, but I know I didnt care for it to much. the management sucked, the co-workers were not all that nice or helpful and if something went wrong you blame it on the new guy at the time(me). the hardest part of working there was when the manager, and the 2 other higher ups left for vacation at the same time, for a week.... and I didnt know what to do, for I was more or less in charge being the only one there at the time that was there for more than 3 weeks. so I did my best trying to run the deli, and after a week everyone came back and gave the new guys a ""good job holding on with out us"".. the more I think about it, the more I think everyone didnt like me while I worked there..... the best part was leaving the job to find something better. I didnt look back or even try to get my job back after I left, and I was happy about that."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,The worse place to work at I would never go back even if they paid me a million dollars a day to work the minimum amount of hours. I don't understand how they could still be in business.
bad,Your position in the store is not concrete. No matter where you'd like to be placed you will be transferred to different areas in the store without your consent in a very irate way. They also do NOT take personal life into consideration. Overall i hated it and my opinion was not a very uncommon one within the store.
bad,"Poor management. No room to advance. No wage increase. A company that only cares about making money, does not care about employees or the community."
bad,My typical day is working 5 hours and no overtime. I really wish they give more hours to employees who want to provide for their families.
bad,"I feel sorry for people that work there right now. wages are so low and they make us work like salves. "
bad,"This company was horrible to work for, bad hours and pay. BAD BAD BAD BAD"
bad,"No full time positions. They work around the seasons. If you are lucky you get 20 hrs a week. "
bad,i was a high school student and never had the ability for school work i worked every evening from when i got out of school until 9 pm i worked alone with no back up when the store backed up the most and worked as a manager with barely any training. we were alwas under stocked and un appreciated and never given the time off we requested when promised
bad,"*THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL SAFEWAYS*"
bad,it was nice see the same people coming to work and helping them out
bad,management is horrible they dont hire enough people so they expect the work of 3 people done by one person you get yelled at for being a couple min overtime because you had to do the work of 3 people every day for little pay because safeway is a stingy company! horrible benefits
bad,"I loved working at Safeway because its a very friendly environment. My co-worker were really nice and help you when ask for help."
bad,I disliked my Safeway store mainly because of how horrible our management was. On a daily basis our management outright expressed who they liked and who they did not. And it was even more clear you were not liked when the weekly schedule came out. With the management openly choosing favorites it created a hostile work environment between other employees. Management would partake in gossiping about other workers and threatening to fire or give disciplinary action to anyone who was out of turn. Worst thing union dues.
bad,"The pay is horrible, the amount of work to do is overwhelming, and there is a labor union involved for 99% of the workers."
bad,I have been with the company for over 20 years and I find it a great place advance and learn.
bad,"Management sucked coworkers got defensive and threw everyone under the bus"
bad,"No matter what you do, its never enough for this co. Management is discriminatory against older individuals. No hours, benefits not great, poor pay on the new contract."
bad,As a 20 year employee I have regret that I stayed with this company for so long. Poor management and hard working employees get the shaft. The poor workers get advancement . Sorry I stayed in such a poorly ran company..
bad,"it was a great company to work for,overall i needed more in the quietly of growing in corp."
bad,"Women need not apply accept in deli or bakery.They are definitely a good ole boys club with a few token female mgrs. As a thirty year employee I could look around at an all men's club. Human resources runs the company,and the politics are very high. They are looking to replace all longtime employees with new at a lower pay scale. The union does nothing but take your money. The hours you are expected to work are ridiculous and all they care about is how much money each store makes. Every employee can be replaced very quickly because of the economy. Turnover is very high!"
bad,"Safeway does not care about any of their employees. All they care about is a good customer rating and will do anything to achieve it. Feel free to throw a hissy fit to get want you want, because it is their job to give it to you. Not only do you not make enough for the amount you do, the union steals most of your paycheck each week."
bad,"you are forced to join a union, managers ask so much of you, then write you up for when you cant finish everything that they told you to do. vacation pay is honestly up to the manager, i never get paid, my wages are cut, and schedule sucks. minimum 16 hours which with your union dues taken out, is about 80 dollars."
bad,Was come down hard on for being the one white man. Worked hard and came to work everyday than had hours cut for no reason.
bad,"They want to much form you."
bad,Covington Bakery has the worst training I've ever experienced with a do what I say attitude I've honestly never hated a job so much. The work is hard and the pay is little all for what? To get union dues and maybe pay a bill. I don't think so. There's no way to make great money here so if you don't care then Safeway bakery is all yours. Just don't mess up the french bread.
bad,"not the best place to work at"
bad,"The store where I worked was always so short staffed that you cant be out sick period. not that I do that often or anything but I should not be in the deli with vomiting and diarrhea. the management does not work with you on anything. and our union rep said that safeway was the toughest they had to work with. I was told upon being hired that I could request a lunch. I requested a lunch for any straight eights they scheduled me for and was never given one. I don't recommend them to anyone. I also had a coworker who quit because she hadn't been paid in several weeks, I happened to be standing outside the managers office who's door was wide open to the employee lounge telling someone on the phone that said employee was a welfare case and serveral other unpleasantries. my review don't do it"
bad,"it is an opportunity for me to work in this company, because i learn so much."
bad,Honestly I couldn't be happier to get out of their. They wouldn't work on my request of full time. The Hours were ridiculous more so than most jobs. I went into to my Job thinking it as just that a job nothing more nothing less. When it comes to recomanding this company I would NOT recomand it to anybody stay away from this work.
bad,"Early morning intake of chilled products."
bad,Just like the title reads this job will work you to the bone and pay you minimum wage while expecting the world out of you.  Did not care how they treated you that's why the workers are in a union.  But the union representative does nothing to help as he does not care either.  He will listen to you about any problems you have but that's as far as he goes in terms of helping you seek fairness within the store.
bad,Safeway will make promises to you with NO intention of keeping them.  Many co-workers complained about the same issue.  If you choose to work there make sure you get every promise in writing.  Then watch your back....
bad,This position they hiring for is only for 2 days a week there going out of business n closing all stores dont waste your time!!
bad,"I would just bag customers orders and ensure that everything was bagged properly. Eggs and bread together, cold items in the same bag, single bag for meats, no more than 13 items in 1 bag, etc. I would also assist customers with carry-outs to help unload groceries into their vehicles. Another part of my job was to clear away the shopping baskets on the parking lot and turns would be taken amongst my co-workers and I which would lead to 1 hour shifts every 2-4 hours depending on the scheduling. It wasn't to bad but I just received minimum wage at the time... I was so happy when I got my 40 cent raise for it only to be completely ignored after a new minimum wage law was passed."
bad,"When I took that job it sounded awesome."
bad,"I am a single mature woman that my job is all that I have to survive on!"
bad,"Safeway is very unprofessional managers are rude, and unreliable."
bad,"This place is horrible. The cashiers always get into arguments, promotions are given to the pretty not the hard working, the union screws you over."
bad,"it's the worst job ever. no time advance you are stuck in your job title, i did not have a good experience"
bad,"It was alright you worked really, payed well it was ok working there"
bad,"Hard work until shift is over"
bad,"load truck for deliveries "
bad,I started working at Safeway in the evenings as a second job I think because of my age 19 they kept moving me around store to store where my weekly pay would not cover my gas and when I asked for a permanent location i was layed off
bad,I was very unhappy at this job. It was extremely hard to go to work there. The store was understaffed and a very stressful place to work
bad,it was fun but not really good management also I would really work if I was really sick and still put me to work or else I would be fire.. as management says. didn't really like it after 5 yrs..
bad,"two thumbs down, again what more to say, accept these companies have to learn how to treat people with respect"
bad,"They never listen to both sides of a story, and even thou you have video to prove your innocent when you did nothing wrong they use it to fire you. And no I would never work for them again."
bad,"Did not like the experience at all."
bad,"Management is not the greatest. The start pay is not good, and it takes a long time to get a 5 cent raise. Co-Workers are awesome, except for some supervisors. The hardest part of the job is being over worked for such little pay, the management likes to take advantage of their employees and make them do jobs that are not part of their job title, they like to schedule a small staff on busy days to save money.  "
bad,"The actual job at Safeway was awesome.  I believe the cashiers hired when the new Hilo store opened were hired just for that purpose, because we all got laid off at the end of our probation period.  I gladly took on additional hours and worked the shifts that nobody else really wanted.  It would have been fine if management would have explained from the beginning that this was a temporary hire.  That way we could have planned accordingly.  But alas...we were just kind of hung out to dry."
bad,A typical day is me usually providing customer service for customers
bad,I would never work for safeway. you work your butt off the management really does not care about your well being and they are not respectful of your schedule out side of work and they expect you to make them your first priority at 8.75 an hour and the union is unreliable and the management will also tell you that you can not call in sick to work. overall treatment of their employees is horrible i would give them zero stars if i could they are horrible! worst place i have ever worked in my life and i am a hard worker but they were understaffed everywhere and blamed individuals when the job did not get done when staffing was the true issue everything could have gotten done if they had two people working my shift. Not to mention getting benefits though them is the biggest pain in the butt. You have to work for years in order to get them and most of the employees are suffering with out work benefits. 
bad,"They pay you nothing, don't care if you have a life outside of work (i.e. school) and feel this should compensate for them attempting to have complete control of your life."
bad,treats employees like poorly.  Only way to move up is by treating others poorly.  They don't work around your schedule.  If would like a different schdule they say they can find someone else to replace you.
bad,this job has no really good points as a job they just work you to death and don't pay worth anything
bad,"Wow ...for such a big company you""d think the employees would be happy..I was shocked on how lazy the workers in certain departments are.I also was shocked on how much involvment management isnt.This company definately isnt family oriented.I feel if your family member was dying ,theyd tell you ""OH WELL "" sorry about your luck."
bad,It was a fun new place to work intill i gotten to knoq the manger's they were very mean and rude to me they always put me down and i had no respect from them after i been gone for a week because i just had a baby they haven't gave a me any days to work so i been out of work for 6 weeks now and they still wont give me any hours i been working hard for 2 years to move up and they hire new workers
bad,They are not fair they person that they had as manager over the deli is very unfare and dosent listen the person who in question they did this to a few people. Safeway is not a good company to work for
bad,"After working for Safeway, it is not a reliable job. Because they are Union based, they are able to take other employees hours as long as that employee has at least 8 hours in a week."
bad,Low pay
bad,this company do not respect it employees as well as they do noy inforce protacal that is tought in training and there managment team is very unprofessional
bad,"the safeway location i worked in, treated their employees like slaves. not fun at all"
bad,"I wish they understood us more here at this job, there is alot of miss commications ."
bad,"I was sadly disappointed with the Safeway job experience. It's too bad too, because ""Vons"" used be a great place to work. Or, so I hear."
bad,"Safeway as a company over works their employees and under pay them. They don't care about employees personal lives, Safeway even has the employees go without breaks even when its an 8 hour shift. Management never helps out but always criticize employees even when they are doing a wonderful job."
bad,i worked there for so many years last year had major surgery and when it came time to go back to work they would to work with me and my restrictions i asked about other positions my manager didnt have time to call other stores but yet he promoted 2 guys to checkers even though i had seniority. was that a slap in the face
bad,"After 25+ years of progressive, upward mobility, I went to Vons/Safeway and was promised much, given nothing, and learned nothing. One pay increase, 3%, in four years. The Insurance costs are approximately 15% of your BASE salary. (No joke.) The are NO bonuses. (No joke.) Not recommended for white males over 40. The hardest part of the day was going to work. The most enjoyable part was leaving. They expect 10-14 hour days with no hope or advancement unless you are ""chosen"" by Senior Management. (Think of a monkey opearting a space capsule: flip buttons, hit the blinking switches, and hope they don't taser you.) Front line supervision is cannon fodder, grease to build the pyramid. They are ruthless; they operate on fear. However, if you have served in the military, are between the ages of 30 and 40, are a woman, or of Hispanic descent, and are willing to remain in one, ,low ranking, position for 15 or more years, brother, this is the place for you...not recommended in the strongest possible terms..."
bad,"The co workers in my department had little to no social skills, or custmers service skills. At 19 years old I didnt have the experience to know how to deal with such aggressive co workers. It was a poor experience, and I wont go back."
bad,The market is competitive that its hard to go to work and deal with the day to day work day. The upper management and the customer are never happy. The company seem to want store management to do all of the management work and also everything else in the stores.
bad,"The benefit of meeting new people,and helping people when needed"
bad,It is a great place to work if you want to work hard and get nothing in return.
bad,"I worked at the Pleasanton, CA store. The employees were great. The managers were jerks. I liked this company until I worked there and found out what they are really like. I am speaking for the Pleasanton store ONLY. I try to never shop at Safeway. The pay stinks, the hours stink, their ""union"" is cheezy."
bad,I worked for safeway for more then a year now that I no longer work there and itsd been more then 10 years I tryed to reapply and they will not becuase I used to work there. I even have more experiance in the fields they have and won't even concider the application.
bad,"I came highly recommended with previous management skills & I received no respect for any of that but instead treated like a piece of S#%! On the ground by not only management but the high school drama queens who constantly lied & missed work then stole others shifts to make up for the shifts they missed! Do yourself a SOLID & run, run the other direction away from Rivermark Safeway/Starbucks because once your caught up in the web of horrid people it’s almost impossible  to get away from them."
bad,"They will lie to you about raises, benefits ect. They will give you a certain time limit on tasks that are physically impossible to complete. They’ll always expect you to stay later and don’t care if you have appointments to take care of. If I could give this review zero stars I would have."
bad,"No lunch breaks, rude pharmacist to staff and patients. District manager is an awful cold hearted, horrible woman.  Manager also just thinks about money making. No true care for patients."
bad,"Working here is just like a typical job for any new worker or young adult fresh out of highschool. The pay is minimum wage, the hours are not gauranteed to be 40 hours, unless you work there for years an earn journeymen pay.  Better off working anywhere else that pays minimum wage an gives you 40 hours. Management has no idea what they are doing for nightcrew"
bad,"Even though I completely hated working there. I still pushed to get everything I was assigned and then some. I worked harder than anyone else in my position. I wanted to move, every time they offered, I accepted but never did move up, the most they did for me was gave me employee of the month and a $25 gift card for the store. For whatever reason, they weren't able to move me up/and or increase pay."
bad,It's cool for your first job. Don't get stuck here. They don't take care of employees. The only way you make money is if you're a store director other than that no good
bad,Very under handed people working at the corporate level. It was plenty of opportunity in the beginning and the 3 ladies whom ran that department were great by far very caring. As the 3 ladies were replaced or moved and others came in it went straight down and very crooked !!!!
bad,"I was excited to work their at first but quickly realized it had been a mistake to work there at all, the store manager daily made all the managers cry , like tears flowing and all that and these people where really good at their job but he just yelled all the time and made it so stressful we had an extremely high turn over rate of both workers and mng's and it was almost 2-3 years to finally get the company to remove him . i watched him actually ""break"" a person"""
bad,"I have worked at two different locations for the past three years. One store as a part time employee and the other as a department manager. Upper management and the company does not care about its employees. 90% of employees are unhappy with their job, how they are treated, how much they are compensated, and how much the company is lacking in decency and respect for its employees. I would not recome to this job or company to anyoneZ do yourself a favor and run while you have the chance"
bad,They dont actually care about you. And the manager is terrible They care about making money and that’s it. Work you to death or not at all. Very inconsistent
bad,my coworkers were great my management was terrible the company doesn't care about their employees and doesn't believe in paying a fir salary to their workers the only good thing is they are union.
bad,"Management didn’t care about the people. They only cared about what you haven’t gotten done by the time they come over and check up on you which was very rare. Management only cares about their look rather then quality. They only care about getting a customer in and out, rather then asking them how’s their day going. It really made my time working at Safeway miserable."
bad,It doesn't seem like the company cares about its employees. I like the people I work with but they seem to want me to put my life on hold for them....
bad,I put in a schedule days I can and cannot work they don’t care they’ll schedule you when they want whatever’s convenient for them is what you get. Can’t request certain days off no matter how far ahead you tell them
bad,Back in the early 90s Safeway have a great company to work for but they have steadily gone downhill and now owned by Albertsons if you want a nightmare go to work for them
bad,"At first working for Vons was great. Now that Albertsons owns it, it has gone downhill."
bad,I learned a lot while working at the select location I was at. There was a vast array of personality types and backgrounds who would come through my line and it taught  me a lot about conflict resolution.
bad,The store and its management team are immature and unprofessional. They make the work environment there for employees not in any way easy for you to do your tasks and they refuse to add additional hires to the departments that are needing help most desperately.
bad,The safeway was very poorly managed and there is no room to move forward at the company. The only raises available are 25 cents every 6 months. It is perhaps the worst company I have ever worked for.
bad,It was a good high school job for a little bit. I really regretted working at Safeway overall though. When I got into the produce department the manager who btw was probably the best manager I’ve had  and the team made it much better I’d give them all 5 stars but it really wasnt worth the pay and headache. If you’re a courtesy clerk you’re  basically chopped meat. They don’t treat you well.
bad,"Company morale is very bad. They don’t value employees as family or friends. Just another body they can shuffle in and out"
bad,"If you are young they have no problem working you into the ground so the older ladies can do what they need to though in the same hand when you need hours, you come second to the older employees. If someone calls out you're guilted into staying or you feel like youre going to get in trouble which probably wasn't the case but it felt like it with all the gossip."
bad,For being a Union Place and having to pay union dues you get none of the benefits I'm working for the Union still give you a rule book that is not in sync with the stores rules
bad,If you want to sacrifice your entire life for a company that will fire you without a second thought and pay you for 40hrs  but expect 70+ hours a week then this is the job for you.  If you don’t want to have a regular schedule and work all hours of the night and be treated like a sl@ve.  If you are not sold already don’t forget that you have to babysit 100+  children
bad,"Main manager only plays the blame game. I worked harder than 2 people always. I have been even called a locomotive. Continually covered for my boss. She didn't even become a manager until I transferred from another store. I was ordering and covering for the week sales. I was terminated for what they said I did a no show no call. I had never even been wrote up. I called when I said I would my husband has been in bed for over 8 weeks and is in critical condition and they said they would work with me and then fired me liers"
bad,The management was absolutely dreadful. Store manager doesn’t have a single care about the workers or our concerns. There was no sense of teamwork. Bad wages for higher positions.
bad,"I worked for this company for over 3 years. There is nothing positive about working here other than a steady paycheck. I was a full time employee yet was never guaranteed full time hours each week due to the store manager cutting hours consistently. The management does not care for their employees nor do they want to listen to any of the problems or concerns you try to share with them and will do absolutely nothing to resolve them. Department manager was not capable of handling employee conflicts within the department. Department was full of employees that only wanted to create conflict and drama between one another which made this place and extremely negative environment to work in. You will be overworked and underpaid, they expect you to do too much that you will never be capable of completing in one shift. You will be forced to work every holiday, weekend, and never get any time off unless you have years and years of seniority. Overall, this is a terrible place to work and there are much better opportunities out there than this company."
bad,"They were not fair to me therr and had me lift every thing heavy there with no help and i"
bad,Don't consider employment with this company. Over worked and under paid. They never acknowledge any good you do and they aren't satisfied with anything
bad,Horrible place poor management low payment they talk to you any kind of way that they sees fit and poor hygiene at the deli Area an never have anything in stock
bad,"I worked two stints at this particular store: from 1996-1999, and again from 2008-2010.  My experiences of the two employment periods were starkly different from each other.  From 1996-1999, the store managers, assistant managers, and department managers collaborated effectively to ensure that their customers were satisfied.  During the latter employment experience with this company, the store manager seemed very disinterested in maintaining a satisfactory experience for her patrons.  Training for new employees was limited to minimal computer-based applications and a bit of guidance from front-end or department managers, who rarely appeared to be on the same page."
bad,"Training is a joke."
bad,"It is a very stressful workplace, not because of the workload, but because of the people you work with. They have been at their jobs for a very long time and are only holding on to their jobs because they do not have anywhere else to go to get paid high. It is a union workplace, and you get raises based on the number of hours you work, hence the employees not wanting to leave."
bad,"Download products in aisle to be stocked on shelves. Cleanup by collecting cardboard and plastic. Insert cardboard in Baler to create bale. Faced products near end of shift. Manager lack people skills, she talks down and threaten employees. Hardest part of the job is down stocking multiple pallets. Workplace culture high-tension. Enjoyable part of the job, looking forward to going home."
bad,"Safeway is owned by Cerberus.  That should be a red flag right there.  For those who don't know, in Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three head demon dog that guards the underworld, devouring the souls of any dead person who tries to escape and any living person who attempts to enter.  It is a monster so evil that even Disney could not figure out a way to portray it in a lighthearted tone."
bad,"Used to have a good management, coworkers are good but not the management. now every week of your schedule expect that the manager are going to called you off 2 to 3 times every week. They only want you to work for like atleast 12 - 20 hrs per week. And They kept hiring new drivers and cut all the hours of the other drivers that has been there for a long time. Not a place to stay. Very poor management."
bad,"Store Management at this particular store was woefully pathetic.  Frequently very unprofessional and unresponsive to customer or associate needs.  Problem solving was not their forte, and declining sales at this store was intricately linked to the incompetency of the store manager and lead assistant manager/person-in-charge.  I suppose it didn't help that they were secretly dating."
bad,"Store management is awful, they will yell at you even when you've done nothing wrong, constant threats to lose your job, threats of being written up, management will approve split shifts and then blame you and act like they never approved it. High school level drama and bullying, you get a 5% discount on everything, no PTO, no unpaid vacation time, unpredictable scheduling, no hours available but understaffed. I wish I could say something good about this position but there are none, I am the lowest paid person in the entire store yet the most micromanaged and in a specialty department that should be paid around $12/ hour."
bad,"Unhonest work environment. Promised raises and advancement only to be taken away for no apparent reason. Unreliable work hours. One week would have 40 hours, the next week would be 24 hours in order to keep me at part time so i could  not receive full time benefits."
bad,"Must pay union fees for a union that does not protect their employees. Must sign an open availability form to guarantee more than 20 hours a week, must come in if called in. Workers referred to safeway as ""slaveway"""
bad,Manager who was a woman continued to sexually harass me and offered me marijuana. My work was made very uncomfortable due to her. I did enjoy working with customers though and most of my coworkers were helpful when I started.
bad,"Toxic working environment, low moral and extremely poor management. The store manager had the employees stressed out and demanded that you complete your tasks or possibly be dismissed."
bad,"Hiring process was easy."
bad,"Gone are the days of a company with integrity.  I started in the 80's and the culture was...every employee mattered. When a long time employee became seriously ill...we all bonded together and gave up a day or two of our own sick pay to help. That employee could stay out much longer to heal and return to work.  That is loyalty and the return on that investment can be measured by very low turnover, excellence attendance records and working earnestly.  Safeway today is cutthroat  and de-valuing of employees."
bad,"Poor work culture"
bad,"Albertson's buyout of safeway has ruined the diversity and morale.  Employees don't have a voice. I'm not retail, but office employees are like robots."
bad,I did not enjoy my time there. It is mimimum wage with no room for advancenent and  you arecrequired to joon a Union it is not optional and the duescafe automatically withdrawn from your paycheck.
bad,Safeway does not care about their employees. They do not hire enough people to be a successful with customers and staff. Overwork employees to make up for lack of staff but refuse to give full-time hours.
bad,"I didn't enjoy working at Safeway because I felt like all courtesy clerks were put into unfair situations. At times I would be the only courtesy clerk for hours and it would be very busy. Also, I'd be yelled at for not getting at carts in at busy hours, I just had a very bad experience."
bad,"You can only get fired within the first 3 months if you are not working up to expectations. after the first 3 months... then you are in the union and you pay union dues.When you are in the union u can only get fired for stealing, not doing your job tasks. the old contracts for employees were better than the newer ones, By them saving money did it benefit the newer employees? Its a good starter job."
bad,"Safeway does not care about their employees. They will cut your hours regardless of how hard you work, they refuse to listen to any concerns you have, they threaten your job if you are a single parent and they have no regard for people of color or women."
bad,This company is going under and won't give employees dependable hours. This is a job for someone who has no bills and just wants spending money. There is no guarantee that you'll be able to provide for yourself off their hours/wages let alone provide for anyone else.
bad,DONT DO IT! Find Something Better! Not worth anyone hard work or time. company has gone down hill since it was bought out. they no longer care for the employee. its all about the $$$
bad,If management didn't like you then good luck advancing. Hard work doesn't pay off because no matter how hard you worked you wouldn't get recognition and always get yelled at for not doing something. the hardest part about working there was the other employees because they were lazy and didn't work and the management because they didn't care about you. A typical day at safeway was working hard and getting in trouble for something that you had no control over. Management is fixed there and everyone talked about you no matter what it was. I learned that you cant trust no one and not to rely on anyone.
bad,"Corporate emphasis on great customer service is not reflected in the hours invested in stores."
bad,The work it's self is fine. But when you mix in everyone's drama and complaining it becomes like high school or middle school. Management doesn't care about you only care about getting their bonuses. There always seems to be someone at the grocery store that will always try to get in your business and start drama. Best to lay low and talk to as few people as possible. I worked graveyard stocking shelfs which was good except for the hours.
bad,The hours are capricious and constantly shift from week to week with no rhyme or reason. The managers are terrible at keeping up at their job. For all their qualifications they are really just glorified cashiers.
bad,"If you enjoy being confuse, from lack of training, and being pressure everyday to know every single detail about the store under a limited amount of time and like having privileged customers downgrading you everyday, well safeway is the job for you. Trust me everyday I go to work here, and every employee always mentions how much they hated here. Save yourself and move on."
bad,"Management has their favorites. They do not care for their employees.  Pay is terrible, no one is treated with respect. You're asked to do so much with low pay.  Benefits don't begin till you've worked for a year. Hours and scheduling are a joke."
bad,"The management at Safeway does not care about their employees well-being whatsoever. I was consistently underpaid, and never allowed a single opportunity for advancement despite being consistently promised opportunities. Management also refused to change my schedule to work around school."
bad,"I didn't work at safeway for long but I was very disappointed in the way people treated me, co workers and managers. People liked to talk a lot of rumours but I had one friend who got me through it until I had enough."
bad,"Clearly a lack of communication within the store, does not care about employees and promotes gossip among management team and workers, general manager joked about firing employees in front of other employees, degrading and disrespectful, openly talks to customers about employees wages... I could go on, just a hostile environment and not worth the stress to stay with this company. There were a lot of unhappy employees and it was just depressing."
bad,I won't ever come back to this company since they treat their employees like dogs on a tight and short leash. Hierarchy is not how to run a successful business.
bad,Really fast paced work. Had to do a lot of stuff in so less time. Fear of being fired all the time. Most people there are not happy with what they do there
bad,This job is not worth it. You always show up on time or early and no one cares about it. You are always being yelled at especially if you didn't do anything wrong and my boss was a potty mouth.
bad,"I worked at the same location for the better part of a decade and all I came away with was that not only does corporate not care about the employees, but the management will outright tell you to quit if you don't like it. No matter how far in advance you apply for vacations they will cancel even approved time off."
bad,Obussive management unprofessional at best co workers who drag their feet low wages for hard demanding work I personally would never work for them again and I was employed thief for 8 years as a bakery manager. Safeway has become a joke 20 years ago when I first worked for them it was a good job all the way around now it is pittiful
bad,"Hours were all over the place, no consistency. Very little feedback from management. No benefits for 16 months and very little chance for advancement. Hard work was not noticed."
bad,"Hours are continually being cut, forcing people to skip breaks, work off the clock, etc. If you don't get everything finished, you know it will devolve onto the next poor sap who comes in. You need to check each pay check you get, as it appears to be policy to underpay all employees whenever possible. Vacation will not be paid, you will not get the wage you are promised, you won't get holiday pay. You will be expected to be available 24/7. They make it known that everyone is replaceable."
bad,"When i first started it was a good company to wok for, but the company began to change and become more about profits less about employees."
bad,They pay minimum wage and work you twice as hard. Schedules change constantly because they want to be the priority job. After three months you will need to pay a hefty union fee.  Managers are arrogant and bullies. Team work is non exsistent. Everyone  works for themselves while calling it teamwork. The enjoyable part of my job is the customers and the fact that they only let you work 24 hours a week.  No employee appreciation
bad,"Never enough help. Lost a lot of people in Deli in last year NONE replaced "
bad,Trust me. You do not want to work here.  They are cutting hours - so they basically want you to work with a 'sense of urgency' - which means do a LOT more with a LOT less.  Which means extreme understaffing.  Work here if you want - but Don't say you were not warned.  I'm currently looking for other employment.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Manager was friendly. Good Co-Workers."
bad,If you do not like the cold and to run around all day this job is not for you. Making anything from Guacamole to watermelon bowls all day in 40 degrees getting wet and freezing.
bad,"The only benefit in working for this company is the friendships developed with co workers. Management is underhanded and their expectations are unrealistic. Your self esteemed will be lowered by the complete disregard management has for you, nothing you do is good enough."
bad,"At first, this job was OK. But, then it went sour.... FAST! The customers were VERY rude and constantly judged me based on what I was doing and how I was bagging their groceries. I also had some difficulty with keeping up with the pace of bagging groceries then switching lanes to bag more groceries and then to clean the bathrooms and then go out in either in the rain or hot sun to push carts into the designated cart place. Keep in mind I had just been released to work after my knee had healed from surgery."
bad,"Managers usually don't do anything butt sit in the office and walk around the store. not actually making the store a better place. Management also isn't very understanding when it comes to school schedules  for the a college Kids that I have talked too. If they have to have a schedule set to be a certain way they usually give them less hours instead of helping them out. Store also Trains helper clerks etc as checkers so that Management doesn't have to help check if need be, which doesn't seem right. Store has many things going on that shouldn't be happening but management just lets it slide ."
bad,"Had time taken off due to doctors orders and when I came back and let them know i was able to work they just told me they would get around to it but never did and just left me hanging, not very professional"
bad,"I worked for Safeway for one year and it was the worst place I have ever worked.  There is no work\life balance.  They pay ok if you are on the old contracts not the new ones.  There is no advancement and our store manager was rude, mean and all about his bonus.  I will never work for them again."
bad,"As a baker I was expected to bake breads and decorate cakes. I was only given three days of training before being left entirely on my own in the bakery. It was a lot of pressure, having never worked in a bakery before. I could bake the breads, stock shelves and help customers no problem but decorating cakes was a challenge."
bad,"For all the flack you get from customers and management alike, you consistent hard work go unappreciated. If you get a promotion, it's sheer luck or its because no one else will do it and they know you are a person who will try and be team player but will neglect to give you a pay raise for the extra work you just took on."
bad,The management is horrible and led by a bunch of kids that don't know what they are doing. I will never shop at Safeway again
bad,"A typical day consisted of coming in to find that the truck was either late or that one or more crew members had decided to quit. On a good night you'd have four people working a 900-1200 piece load and be expected to be done stocking in about 5 hours. The rest of your time is spent facing the store, which is tedious, especially when there would always be a senior team member who decides to not help and talk to the other department members as they came in for their shifts. Most days you would get out on time, but others you'd be expected to stay over to finish facing. Then there be berated for getting overtime."
bad,This place in this state refuses to allow you to work their without being part of the union. Being part of a union should be a choice.
bad,"Some advancement possibility but at a wage below poverty level, management has unrealistic employee expectations."
bad,"A pathetic pharmacy operation.  Management is more concerned about how clean their unused and worthless Wellness Centers are than how well pharmacists take care of patients.  Corporate management micromanages pharmacists and techs, threaten and harass the workers, and always make you feel like you are about to get fired over petty violations like keeping a coat in the pharmacy.  They actually come in and search for ways to get you in trouble.  They are biased, cliquish, unfair, and uncool."
bad,"I have being working with Safeway Grocery for numerous years now. I have seen a lot of changes, good and bad changes. Safeway has been declining as of late as far as having adequate staff taking on a full day of labor and customer service. I noticed lately, that' all employees are being forced to work harder and faster due to lack of insufficient labor. In addition, causing unpleasant and rude customers because of longer wait times to check out and inconveniences with being helped or having products stocked on a regular basis. This company used to be very employee-friendly and striving chain of retail."
bad,"The store manager and hiring manager treated me like I was a piece of dirt being disrespectful and not caring about my well being. I got little to no hours, little pay, and never got recognized for all the hard work I was doing. This will be the last time I ever work here especally in AZ."
bad,They pay you so little but you have to do so much. You get an hour long lunch but they dont give you a discount on anything bu a Soda! -.-
bad,"Although I loved giving great customer service and my fellow employees were pretty neat, the Safeway Corp appears to be interested in only one thing, the bottom line. While cutting their employees hours, they would continue to make new hires. It just didn't make sense. They expect their employees to give ""World Class Service"" while treating those same employees like dirt."
bad,I learned so much with this company. Especially how to talk to people and how to handle sticky situations with finesse and tack.
bad,"Most of the miniscule wages earned went to monthly union dues. The union reps are very difficult to get a hold of and don't follow up on things. They seem to work more for the store instead of for the employees who pay for their coverage. Management is just that...muscle, demeaning, negative. Everything that management should not be. Instead of grinding their heel into your back, they should lend a hand and help you up. The customers and my coworkers were the best part of my job. Whenever I speak to one of my friends still at the store, they hate being there! I have never heard anyone say anything positive about working at Safeway!!"
bad,"work was stressful, with lots of old people. people would act like they have never been to a grocery store before. the managers only care about their bonuses and if you get in the way of that, they try to ruin your life. the only good part about safeway are all the other employees that work their butts off for nothing at the end of the day."
bad,"I have worked for Slaveway for about a year now. Making just above Min wage still. They promise you more hours if you help drive more sales. No matter how hard you work, your hours go up and down like a yo-yo. No real pay increase for 5 years, what I hear. I work in the Deli. We are always short staffed. Our manager hates working with customers and expects us to do it all so she can hide somewhere supposedly doing endless paper work. Don't ever be late, skip a lunch, park in the wrong place, wear the wrong clothes or you'll be written-up and nagged endlessly. Our store makes us do these observation reports daily which are increasingly a waste of time and nobody takes seriously. Going hand-in-hand with cutting hours, they also order less supplies we need such as detergent for the dishwasher or plastic gloves we are required to wear. Even garbage bags for our trash cans.There are constant inspections, secret shoppers which grade your performance and unexpected tasks handed out to complete at a moments notice that will drive you crazy. They always preach how important it is to score well, but you will never see any reward for your efforts. Oh, maybe stale old cake or donuts in the break room, Whoopee! And don't get me started with the music they play in the store. Anything depressing or Billy Joel is all they play."
bad,Did teach how deadlines are important and working as team memeber
bad,You get a different days to work and random hours which overall are not enough.every week it’s a different schedule some weeks you only get 16 hours and some weeks a little more . If you want to stay in one place and work yourself up it’s going to take years for 40 hours a week and full benefits. Co worker’s are nice but management is not .
bad,Paid the Bill's. The managers did not know anything along with very disrespectful to man kind. Would not work for Safeway again the human resource is awful
bad,Company lies about pay  they say hourly but it is not  they steal money from your trips because it is hard to figure pay  they do not care about their employees you are just a number  the benefits are good only because we are a teamster shop and it is negotiated in contract  the pay is subpar compared to most trucking jobs in the area
bad,This job was so emotionally draining from the drama in the work place and customers screaming at you all day plus low pay isnt enough to hold anyone there. I would never go back.
bad,"I'm not sure if this is just the store I worked at, but it was probably the worst job experience in my life."
bad,"Managment and pay was horrible for experienced grocery store operators."
bad,"I worked there for 3 years, was trained to be a front end manager, was trusted with the keys to the store and the combination to the safe. And I was only making 20 cents over minimum wage. Even when I refused to run the front without a raise, the keys were forced upon me frequently."
bad,"Safeway is the worst company I have ever worked for. I was a Manager and the pressure put on me to put on the employees was horrid. Minimum wages and high expectations from employees were not worth it so the turn over was extremely high and we pushed the dependable employees to quit as well as they were worked to death."
bad,"Enter at ur own risk😊. Safeway is a company that will use you until your soul is gone, pretend they care then squeeze you to see if anything else comes out. While under paying,  over working , and demeaning you. Good luck."
bad,"Safeway is union which helps a little, but when you're on the bottom of the totem pole as far as hours are concerned, it's very tough to continue when you're only getting 25 hours a week"
bad,Working at Safeway is stressful everyone is in there has there own clicks if you dont fit in they will fire you I worked there for over 7 years and I seen it happen all the time .very unprofessional bosses there are very rude and will cut your hours over anything also bosses will tell your personal information to people that work there .I would never work there again and if you are looking to work there go to frys ...
bad,"The store is always under staffed."
bad,"I wanted to go back as a cake decorator. I was talked into being a manager. Then 2 months later transferred and demoted, not to a cake decorator but a baker. There was a baker there for a few years at $12. Hr. Unfair pay for all the work and inconvenience of rediculios hours."
bad,"Multiple health and safety violations were broken at my store. I got food poisoning multiple times from drinking milk from my store that I purchased and brought home. dairy room door open all night, clock hit the red gauge and went above, meaning the milk and other dairy products were at a warm temp for 8+ hours every night. No enforcement of people in packaging/ baking departments to ensure they are washing hands, wearing hairnets, using gloves, multiple times food in bakery was dropped on disgusting floor and then picked up and baked. a close friend worked a local Safeway and had the complete opposite experience. Customers shouldn't deal with those conditions."
bad,Management at Safeway is poorly they treat their employees very badly not a good good place to work. Work hours are terrible they will bounce you back and forth til 11pm then got to be back in at 7am .
bad,wasn't a good job only had 20 hrs or less . managers never wanted to work with you .and to guarantee hours you would of had to had a letter written with how many hours promised . 20 hours or less wasn't enough even working 2 departments.
bad,"Eight years with this company and the only thing that matters is bottom line profit for the store manager and company profits. Consumer concern or employee relations are non-existent. If you have an education, steer clear of this company, drop-outs, are the rule and if you are a current or past drug user, I am sure you will rise within the ranks. Company prefers employees they can manipulate because they know of their limitations. Choose to excel, not to accept indignant treatment by corporate illiteracy. Horrible career choice! The only benefit is the contacts made with customers, the only saving grace!"
bad,Not my first choice more like my last. Would not recommend applying unless your a teen in need of chump change.most managers were veg in training and in overall duty's haveing workers doing things outside of job description tht the manager themselves should be doing
bad,poor staff poor job clean are poor managenet overallpoor job never enough employees always hiring poor rnd employees who never did their jobs i would never recomend
bad,This company has  no direction. Every job description that they have is vague. Corporate management has all these rapid fire initiatives that they keep rebooting all the time. People get fired in mass waves every other year or so.
bad,"At first they make you feel wanted and give you praise. Then they cut your hours, and state corporate forced them. Never know your schedule until Friday. Planning doctor appointments are nightmares due to inconsistency in days. No family time. To get promoted you must go to nights. The night crew manager is unbearable. She expects you to throw 40 cases an hour plus face an aisle in under 30 minutes. check customers out, dump trash, and clean the back room. We are human not machines. Was constantly written up for petty things. Gave two weeks and never looked back."
bad,"I wanted to work at Safeway because my grandmother worked there for 35+ years. Not the same standards and customers were not made to feel like they would enjoy the store's overall experience. Heavy turnover with employees. Too many managers, not enough training. Hours were cut to 10 per week."
bad,"You get yelled at to work faster by Managers because they don't want to help check out the customers and don't end up hiring more employees even when the store is constantly struggling. You will end up having to do 3-4 jobs instead of just the one you signed up for all while being overworked. A family member could be dying and they will still yell at you and tell you that you need to come in anyways. Have paid sicks hours? Good luck trying to use them, they won't let you. Tell the Union? They do nothing but sit around and get paid more than you for it. Courtesy Clerks get the worst of it and get treated like garbage. I've had panic attacks because of how stressful it is to work there, and when I'd go to bed at night I'd have nightmares about that place. The work environment had caused me physical and mental pain. I spiraled back into depression and had to quit because I wanted to commit suicide from all the stress. The only good part was my coworkers and few regular customers. Otherwise most customers are stuck up and belittle you for not being rich like them. You might also get racist comments thrown at you for being anything but Caucasian. I tried to be or at least pretend to be happy working here but I could keep up the facade any longer."
bad,"Management is not able to manage the store. It's always the same story. We were short staffed, only I was left to take all the work which was never appreciated. "
bad,"I was harassed many times by older men and nothing was done about it by security who just watched. Coworkers had bad attitudes and thought they were above you (aka the checkers). I’d be in the parking lot until midnight collecting carts, cleaning a drug-abused bathroom, and cleaning up messes that managers should have stepped in to help with. Also, most recent manager is extremely disrespectful. Overall an unsafe, unhealthy, and poorly managed store. Would never recommend working here, especially to teenage girls."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time at safeway. it was low pay, not enough hours,heavy work load. i did however, like my coworkers. i also learned alot about baking, preparing, and customer service."
bad,I was frequently scheduled to work 6 days a week and was routinely denied vacation requests. Management would do everything they could to cut pharmacy hours even though we routinely met performance goals and operated in the black. Safeway's culture of pharmacy management is dangerous to the Patients and the Employee's health since hours have been reduced so much often you don't receive your breaks or have time to use the restroom since there is no coverage if you have to leave the pharmacy as required by law.
bad,I disliked this job. The manangers were alright. It’s a great store it just didn’t suit me personally. Managers weren’t always cooperative at times. But other than that it was fine
bad,I have worked here for almost 12 years and it keeps getting worse and worse. This company is not run well. Very stressful. Used to have panic attacks when I knew I had to go to work. Management is not on your side.
bad,"A typical day at work for me was welcoming but soon became a hassle as my Manager was a sexist that would pit employees against each other. Repetitive complaints about how your working wasn't as good as the other employees workplace was pretty normal sometimes you had the grumpy overworked people but I've never had a problem with that. I struggled with understanding things and communication was the ABSOLUTE WORST THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the three managers after they had decided i didn't belong there, Best part of the job was going home"
bad,"Working   at Safeway isn't a place you would want a career at alot has change and because the management doesn't care about their employees and that simply bad business , there's no unity there and i am actively looking for a better job ."
bad,"Nearly all employees, unequivocally, hate working there. The management is horrible, unfair and degrading. We all wish to work somewhere else (which is what I'm pursuing now), but most feel stuck. Very little reward for a LOT of work. The union doesn't help either. They vote themselves a raise, and we lose out on a pay increase."
bad,"The people I worked with were generally okay. My concerns were never addressed, I was fired for a misunderstanding, and my manager was biased, and since she didn't like me personally that affected the way she treated me as an employee. Which is a good part of why I believe I was let go"
bad,"If you want to be bullied and treated like you don't matter, then work for safeway. Management has no experience and has no people skills at all. Worst corporate team in American business."
bad,management sucks and only care about themselfs. they change the schedule without letting you know then proceed to yell at you if you miss a shift. its just a joke i 10/10 don't recommend
bad,"They are so desperate for staff and I can see why, they're manager is absolutely rude and lacks communication skills. She offered an interview time that I unfortunately could't make and coped an attitude stating this is an interview, so its important right? If you can treat a potential hire like that i pity the employees."
bad,Not even worth having it be your first job. There are plenty of other nice grocery stores to work at compared to here. Would not recommend to anyone at all.
bad,"Worked here for a very short period of time as the staff was not very friendly and the work environment was pretty stressful. It was a decent first job as you learn a lot about cash register systems and customer service, however it was often difficult as customers were not always friendly as most of them are in a rush to get their groceries. As a cashier, you have to stand in one spot for your whole shift (with 1 or 2 breaks) which can be tough on your legs and feet. Overall, I think it depends a lot on your location as I found the worst part of the job to be unfriendly coworkers."
bad,"I enjoyed my job and helping customers with what I could, only down fall for me was lazy employees picking up slack and rude employees. I enjoyed my time while I was there and made a couple friends."
bad,"It was cool working with Safeway , but everyone there  talk about each other and down talk the next person they to old and miserable and worried about what the next person think or say ."
bad,"I've only worked at one Safeway location in Junction City so my opinions are based on my experiences at that location not all Safeway locations.  The store has no business being open. They changed management almost every 2 months. None of the manager s had been trained to do there jobs. Weekly schedule was posted whenever management decided to post it, and multiple times They changed the schedule in the middle of the week without notifying employees. They don't rotate product. Always found product still on shelf after sell by date. They make night stock crew work the product that just came off trucks first and then the back stock. (Should be other way around)  The Union doesn't care or back the employees. My Union rep was also part owner of the location I worked. It's only a matter of time before that location gets in trouble cause they sold spoiled products and someone gets sick or worse. After bringing these issues to store managers I had my job threatened. I then went to corporate and was told to talk with the Union. The Union rep and I talked about the issues. He responded by informing me he was one of the people that own the location and I needed to get over it or find a new job. The next week I showed for my posted shift and management posted a new schedule and I was given the week off and told they were cutting hours and I should start looking for other work. They never put me back on schedule after that.  I go to work to make money if the house is making money then so am I because then they can afford to give me a raise. If the costumers are happy then the bosses are"
bad,"Working there for almost a year at ""full-Time"" i only worked 2 40 hour weeks out of a whole year. sometimes my hours dropped to 8 hours a week and their excuse was they couldn't afford more hours for me even though literally everyone else got 32 to 40."
bad,The management there is terrible. The hours there are terrible. The treat u unfair. They treat u like a slave. They have lost a lot of customer because. Of the rude mangers they pay you very poorly
bad,"I don't know if it was just me, but my Safeway got shut down, and I absolutely hated it. The management team was awful, they would get mad at you for no reason, had no acknowledgement or reward for the hard work that was being done. Clueless about everything going on in their store. Most of the things were expired, and they gave us useless jobs to keep us occupied because there was not a lot for us to do. No proper training was also given."
bad,stressful inconsistent hours. worked to death. excepted to complete the impossible with no overtime. little attachment to workers with very little concern for them
bad,"- dirty"
bad,The managers were poorly trained & there was a couple scandals going on.It was low staffed so your best wasn't enough.Managers talked about employees.
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work at Safeway.  This is a very stressful environment and management has very high expectations and offers very little support to the employees in my opinion.
bad,You were overworked for what you got paid. No stable work schedule.mangeby was not very nice to customers. People could never find anyone at the service desk.
bad,"Typical Day: Understaffed, complaints, never good enough"
bad,"I hated working here, between the corporate offices constantly changing everything, and managers never listening or knowing what was going on, it was difficult to know a lot."
bad,"If you enjoy working on your days off and working long hours for less than $10 per hour then this is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere. They will expect you to work 2 employees positions at a time when your dept is short handed. I am currently going into week 4 of this type of situation and having a promotion being held in front of me but with no straight answers as to when the position will be posted. I am doing all of the work for that position as well as whatever other position I am assigned to that day. My schedule shifts between 2am-12:30pm and 11:30am-8pm multiple times per week and I feel like I barely have time to sleep in-between shifts."
bad,"i learned Excellent problem solving skills and outgoing, friendly and impeccable customer service skills. The hardest part of working for this company was i was not given enough hours, and when i would get hours they would make me push carts the whole day because they had no other courtesy clerks."
bad,Other employees disrespect the younger co-workers. Two managers are rude and talk down you. There is no sense of teamwork. Others don't do their jobs. The managers go back on their word.
bad,"Managers failed to explain things they wanted done. Also failed to provide proper security for employee items, the break room was broken into and because the person who did it was contracted through a different company nothingever happened and what was stolen was never recovered. "
bad,I would never work here again I was constantly picked on and my boss and supervisor wrote me up for something that everyone did but i only got written up for it. They would tell me I wore to much makeup and not to wear a lot and my co workers would try also getting me in trouble. It was a okay job it took me at least 2 or 3 months to remember the drinks. I only had the closing shifts because my boss played favoritism. In the end i got hurt on the job and the people there didn't care even though I had a doctors note they kept telling me to come in.
bad,"Micromanaging Managers, who will attempt to put more work on your plate to complete than you have time to do it.  And when it does not get done you get reprimanded for it."
bad,Management was awful and they never obeyed my availability. All the workers are crabby old ladies who hate their jobs and give the workplace a miserable atmosphere.
bad,"To all maintenance mechanics stay where you are now  this place got pre madonnas and maint mngr"
bad,"I did not like working at Safeway at all. A typical day of work consists of being overworked and not thanked at all, you have to check off a huge list that you have to complete in 30 min, to thoroughly do the job right it takes at least 1 hour to do everything on the list (most people dont even do it and just clock in that they did). It is just unrealistic to think that one person call do all that in 30 min, especially if there are staffing issues (which there is a lot of)."
bad,This company likes to cut cost on the back of their employees.  They constantly cut labor while at the same time adding to the work load and expect you to perform miracles because if you don't they know that they can find plenty of chumps willing to try.
bad,Typical work day 9-10 hours.  Limited training.  Learning is based untrained job tasks being assigned.  Corrected after attempting to complete task.  Management lacks leadership skills.  Recognized in co-workers feedback and their not being inspired to go above and beyond.  Difficult as new employee to feel welcome.
bad,monotonous tasks surrounded by people who have worked there 5+ years and never have anything good to say about the company.
bad,"not a happy place to work. very unhappy with managers, unhappy employees. i well never go back into that store. high pricing on food poor serves."
bad,Great pay semi-flexible scheduling lack of management and people to fill slots for jobs makes the job a little more stressful
bad,"Starting pay is $15 per hour but do not expect increase nor the hour you are promise at interview."
bad,An okay place to work. Not what I wanted  for a career.  Worked for 3 years with the company. Tired to get promoted but it never happened. Hard to get into a department.
bad,"The store management is so disconnected with the employees and departments that when production is not running properly, instead of trying to help the situation and figure out what the issue is, they just complain and tell you whats not getting done instead of giving you helpful instruction on how to go about fixing issues. There is virtually ZERO training. Everybody has their own jobs and nobody works as a team. The cake decorator is responsible for ALL pastries, cake orders, consultations, and production. the store is open for 7 days a week 6:00am to 1:00am and only one person responsible for all desserts and can only work 40 hours 5 days a week. NO OVERTIME!!!! You get in trouble for not getting all your work done but if you try to stay a little late and catch up, you get in trouble for overtime. Then they tell you that you have to take walk-in cake orders and custom orders yet never considers the extra time it takes to stop what your doing to do that or how long it takes to do custom orders when the details are up to the guest. This could completely throw off the production of the day if people are allowed to constantly come whenever they want and stop production because they aren't prepared. This is the whole reason why there are predecorated cakes available. Its one thing if you have time but 99% of the time you don't.   "
bad,day to day reports. controlling sales and payroll. store presentation. training new employees. things changed almost every day and had to be on top of the changes. Poor directions.
bad,"They expect you to pay them for the privilage to work for them so you can be a part of a union. Unions are very much unneeded these days of age."
bad,There is a demand for performance and loyalty but s severe lack of compensation. People who work hard are over worked and others sit and do nothing.
bad,Store management needs to be better trained on how to treat employees. They have a lot of work to do as far as adequately training and effectively communicating with new employees. This alone negates everything good about the job and makes it a place I would never recommend working.
bad,They are absolutely the worst at work life balance and there is no understanding to the contrary. Very low opportunity for advancement as well.
bad,"I worked at the fuel station, cashier, Kart Pusher. I jumped between the three. I worked in ALL weather conditions including the winter outside. As cashier I scanned groceries, and filled my till until it was full. Worked as a fuel attendant my responsibliltys were to make sure every customers was getting the fuel points that they deserve."
bad,"Didn't like, still don't like it. Can't wait to start my career doing something that I actually like. Working in floral is a lot of fun! The people are so nice. However, not everyone at Safeway knows how to treat a person with kindness."
bad,"A  typical day as a courtesy clerk sucks. But what i learn most from this mind controlling job is not to make friends with no one nor trust them, but mainly what i got from my experience was customer service.Not much to say after that."
bad,This is the worst company in the world!! Management sucks. They are out for themselves. They cheat you by not having you EVER clock over to the correct dept which in turn screws you out of a raise! Most employees are on welfare because Von's will only give 20 hrs at 7.25!! Wal- Mart at least cares and looks out for there employees!! Don't waste your time with any job at Von's.
bad,Constantly battling management and production workers over thefts of tools and lunches management doesn't know how to manage people a lot of church based nepotism
bad,"I am one of the supervisors so I manage a large team of co-workers.  I have learned a lot, I have learn how to manage my time better and multitask while managing a large team. I cashier, process returns, stock shelves, face the shelves, sell money order, rent movies, take care of customer complaints, take care of employee complaints.  I have learned how to do payroll for our store. The hardest part is working 3 nights a week until 1am, or over nights I miss my kids, but it is a part of the job."
bad,"Make sandwiches, cook hot foods, greet customers, maintain a clean work space"
bad,"-Management is not run very well, most of the employees are not satisfied working their. "
bad,"Merchandising, rotate and stock all dairy products. Fellow workers are ok and friendly, But management is lacking in leadership and knowledge of their job"
bad,"Safeway finds ways to push out employees that are hurt on the job. One employee didn't want to go through the drama and instead wore 3 back braces to work because of am injury on the job. Another employee was blocked from getting workmen compensation and was constantly question whether the injury happened at work. This employee has gone 2 months without pay because they offered a shift that he was not available to take due to childcare. Safeway cares about it's customers but not the employees, management was constantly rude and schedules not distributed fairly. If an employee speaks up they are transferred without notice."
bad,"How Safeway has good reviews I will never understand. I was a cashier, the fastest they had in a while according to the charts in the employee lounge/box storage area. My typical week I was scheduled for between 10 and 20 hours, yet I never worked less than 30. I was called in constantly, and eventually I learned that the whole ""you can't call out"" rule they had didn't apply to the pretty new employee. Management was smug, rude, unappreciative, and liked to show up employees that were working hard. The assistant manager took over my check stand to ""show me how it's done."" Needless to say, he was no faster than me, and would have been better off opening up another stand. This brings me to another point: they seemed to schedule every cashier but myself and the midnight worker for the least busy times of day. More than once I was the only one scheduled on the eve of various holidays and busy grocery days. Literally. I was the only non-management employee scheduled to work. Four people in the back room doing nothing while I had to do the job of about four people. I don't mind working hard, but if I get nothing but insults and jokes made at my expense because I didn't know how to handle certain situations (by the way, training was non-existent at the store) were a bit much. At my store, the older employees told me to get out while I could. A friend at another store told me that the guy who writes the checks told her to get out while she could. This is great advice, look elsewhere unless you are desperate, and then only stay as long as you need to. I know that $100 (give or take)"
bad,"Was the worst job I have ever had. Do not apply. They over work you and do not give any benefits. Once you hit a certain amount of hours as a part time worker, which is all they hire, they stop wanting you and give all the hours to the new employees which they seem to never stop hiring. At one point there were at least 40-50 cashiers and people were getting such horrible hours. I remember having a full availability and only getting 4 hours a week. Never work there the work environment is horrible and the management is even worse. The people who work there are pretty good people and deserve so much more than what they get."
bad,"Working as a night foreman is unrewarding and punishing labor. Constant harassment from management, discipline actions placed in personnel file without being notified. Constant reductions of hours and help needed to complete assigned job duties."
bad,In my experience as a manager for this company is that the management in general sucks. It creates very unsatisfied employees. Human Resources is no help. And they always expect you to suck up to elite shoppers. I worked in the Tujunga Vons and there are mutants everywhere. Horrible co-workers that do nothing but gossip because they're so unhappy with their lives. Don't work here unless you are desperate.
bad,"I do not get very many hours, they do not like you to have a second job. They are not the best company to work because hours can always vary depending on how busy they are."
bad,After several work related back fusion surgerys  I was let go as soon as my medical case was settled.
bad,"I was hired by HR rep and he was very friendly and professional. He was excited to have me work for their company. I was excited to start work, but when I got the call to work, it was short notice to work an 8 hour shift within a day. I hadn't even met the store manger or given a welcome to the team introduction. It was ""be here"" phone call and I hadn't even bought the uniform they required or talked to anyone in management about my schedule, duties or expectations. This store is always hiring and from my experience, it's possibly the unfriendly and unprofessional attitude of the manager. Meet management before considering taking the job and ask why there is so much turn around in that store."
bad,Every Company has problems.
bad,"I didnt enjoy working for this employer because of the environment created by the management. I would walk into my department, and discover that nothing was done during the shift before mine. My department managers were either on vacation, or if they were there they were on a continuous smoke break. The managers of the store showed no concern for your well being, there only focus was getting more money at any cost. in addition all the older employees who had worked for safeway for a considerable amount of time were always telling me how Safeway was not the same company they started working for and that I should get out as soon as possible before I was stuck like them."
bad,Jus got layed off there in SEPT looks like there cutting staff and the reason they are hiring in Northlake is because the other DIRECTOR was terminated for hitting an employee. Have been working 13 yrs for Safeway(DOMINCKS) and when i started there was almost 500 employees there now theres less then 200 n they keep cutting staff and not opening new stores or care to open any
bad,Job and management need more training. I only enjoyed the customers they were always nice management needed proper or more formal training
bad,The Safeway culture is not for everyone; extremely conservative.
bad,Safeway does everything in their power to make life miserable for their employees. They enjoy making up sales ploys instead of just selling groceries. The latest example is Just for You. Instead of just offering good deals to their customers they use this latest gimick. They have labor cut back so bad that food safety is an issue.
bad,"I worked here twice over the last few years and I must say the company has gone quite downhill. It once used to be a good place to work with good benefits. Now the benefits are horrible, management treats you like garbage, there is very little work/home life balance and the quality of the employees is very poor. When I worked here in 2006, it wasn't so bad, but the management never treated employees fairly. A few years later, when the market went downhill, I came back to the company out of desperation due to lack of work. I did at least get 24 hours per week, but I was always treated unfairly. Management is very immature, picking ""favorites"" as far as employees. Shortly after I started working for this company, someone was promoted to manager in our department. I was shocked they promoted someone who evidently did not care about her job. They company was desperate and they promoted her because she had open availability. Without much thought, she was promoted and it went downhill from there. She took off frequently for hours on end, leaving the rest of us stuck with all kinds of work, believing that it was ""beneath her"" since she got promoted. Sometimes we'd go without breaks and when I wanted time off, she'd deliberately not give me time off because she controlled my schedule. Employees formed cliques and gossiped all the time with our manager. I had to go to the union several times to help me with this issue and they proved to be useless. The managers are rude and pull you into the office almost every day, barking down your back about something that they think you aren't doing"
bad,"There was no work life balance! 7 years I gave to them, only to get black balled from group because I choose to not relocate to another store due to being a first time mom. Did all their management courses. Jumped through every hoop. Worked at 18/20 store in first two years of employment. Did every special project they wanted. As soon as I became a mom, everything stopped. They also told that I can’t breast feed at work. Put me in a floral storage room where people Would walk in.  This company is so money driven and just down right unethical, if they offered me all the Money in the world, there is no way i’d ever go back! "
bad,"Albertsons/,Safeway cares nothing about employees only bottom line. No respect for employees. If given the chance to work for this company run away as fast as possible"
bad,"Management does not lead by example.  Upper management comes in for store walks and they always tell when they are coming so no one sees what’s really going on and no one ever asks employees how things are going.  Very clicky and unprofessional management."
bad,"I am glad that this my position at Safeway is a stop gap job. I truly feel sorry for the people who have to spend their lives working in Safeway's retail sector. Sure its retail and you get difficult customers at times. And I must say that working at Safeway really forced me to grow up and mature as a man, something I am truly in debt to Safeway for. However, the things that have made my experience horrible is the nature of management. I have noticed that there is a lot of favoritism at Safeway. So really be on the lookout! Having talked to some one who has worked for the company for over 30 years I have come to realize that Safeway really needs to work on fixing her retail sector due to the level of favoritism it is. "
bad,"Scince sobeys merged and hours cuts. Benefits cuts"
bad,Having to work for a Company that hires complaining employees I don’t feel good around them at all. It don’t make any sense why Safeway management don’t have professional skills to tell employees they need to understand the high rate as a customer service should be honors through out the stores employees even the Managers ways they treat other employees with know favoritisms.  It’s was a lot of that going around at SAFEWAYS.
bad,"At first, safeway might seem like a good place to work, or a good first job to have. However, the longer you work there the more stuck you'll feel. The worse they will treat you. If you show your full potential as a worker right away, they will expect it constantly and treat you badly if you slack even a little bit. If you plan on working here, I would advise you dont show your full potential right away, if at all, as they clearly do not value you as a person."
bad,After 4 months of being there I couldn't take it any more . All the employees just run around fighting and stirring up problems all the time. They spent more time arguing and complaint then they did working.
bad,"Terrible managment. The managment gets bonus's for saving the co. Money. So they will cut your hours every chance they can. Your dept. Will always be short staffed so when you do work you will work your butt off. They also change your time in the time clock and erase your o.t. "
bad,Worked here for 13 years.  Toxic environment.  Worst job I’ve ever had.  Whenever someone finally leaves here we all congratulate them for getting out.  Quitting this job is the best thing I’ve ever done!
bad,The store director operated as a boss and not a leader. No team spirit but quick to blame and reprimand. She was condescending and rude in person but acted charming when upper management came into the store. The store environment was everyone for themselves because of the way the Director led the store.
bad,"It was definitely a case of too many chiefs and not enough Indians. We were pressured to meet quotas of immunizations, every year. Even on TdaP. If you met your quota, the goal would go up the next time. I felt like I was a used car salesman. I also felt the company was not interested in health care, just profit."
bad,Good starting job for most people with steady pay and job protections through the Union.  Ill tampered and overworked management mostly with frequent turnover.
bad,"A typical day at work for me was that as soon as I walked in I was being told 6 different things I needed to do immediately, while at the same time I needed to serve customers and clean up the mess left behind by the employees prior to me, especially my manger. A majority of the time I can't get done what is asked of me because I was the only one scheduled for counter help and closing, however the most enjoyable part were my coworkers that I was friends with."
bad,"The store I was at was terrible! Do not ever work at the store on Granite Dr. Rocklin, CA! The management team is terrible, aside from two or three people and the majority of the coworkers is just as bad! The company itself is ok. But, if you are disabled, don't expect any respect and accommodation for your disability! They don't enforce accommodations and no one cares that you have accommodations, so they will make you feel stupid and ashamed of your disability."
bad,"Working in safeway Pharmacy,Dawson Creek ,BC sucks.Manager over there is so lazy. Pressurize fellow pharmacists and assistants all the time.While he is always busy doing paper work all the times.He will show off to show people he works a lot but reality is exactly oppoiste.Most of the times he is the only person who knows what he is talking about.Some of the staff members will criticize you  when you are not there.Management at safeway Pharmacy will expect you to work longer for free ! so cheap management.Always lack of experience staff.Disrespectful working environment for staff.Assistant/Technician give order to Pharmacists.Regardless of reality Higher management will listen only to manager."
bad,"they realluy sucked with schedules,,, hours,, or anything lol.. the manager was lazy and didn't help much which Is probably one of the reason the store closed down"
bad,"I’m considering leaving because of how awful it is. I got hired on the spot, and was never fully trained. Management doesn’t even follow company rules and talks about the employees they don’t like to the other employees. I am expected to know what to do without being told how to do something. Unrealistic expectations and poor treatment of employees. It’s very high stress considering I have too many responsibilities at once. I called out once for a medical emergency and was treated poorly after that. I do not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Honestly from my heart spent 20yr here it was the most stressful job I ever had Albertsons bought them 2017 all they did was cut cut cut labor your one person doing. 5jobs impossible to ever get done with your work.   They want no excuses. Run you into the ground like a dog this is the gods honest truth 2015 my dad passed at 6pm. At 330 that afternoon they wanted me to come in she had to call my boss before she could be human
bad,"There may have been benefits but they don’t tell you anything! When I interviewed I was told I would have to join the union and was that acceptable. I asked how much will that cost. I was told “I don’t know exactly but they will be contacting you with all that information when the time comes. The time came and went with no contact from within Safeway and no contact from the union. 2 months later I get a bill in the mail for $458 which was $400 union initiation fee and 1 month $58 union dues. They contacted me because apparently late charges were also applied. "
bad,"Unprofessional ??  to much drama about each other."
bad,"I worked for this company on two separate occasions, in different positions, and it's always the same. Poor pay, poor hours, and poor management. Just absolutely awful."
bad,"I absolutely hated working here, mostly because it always seemed like people only came to work to chit-chat and gossip and not get any real work done. Then complain about how nothing ever gets done."
bad,I’ve had about 4 different managers since I’ve been working there within the passed 2 years and all of them were horrible. If a manager doesn’t like you they will definitely mess with your hours. If your not a part of the union they’ll definitely mess with you in any way they can if you annoy them.
bad,"I would not recommend working here, the employees were all catty and the manger didn’t care about the employees  at all , it was disappointing seeing how they treated the employees"
bad,"The company cares little to none about its employees, but you coworkers make things at least slightly tolerable, They wont give you any hours no matter how much you beg, or how hard you work"
bad,"I dont have nothing to say. I need more hours. I need more pay, I use to get way more hours.  I been there for four years and barely make over minimum wage. They show favoritism about who gets hours and who doesn't."
bad,I would come to work ready to tackle anything and everything at hand. Clock in use the restroom and begin my day with no interruptions I would take my break and finish the day of like a slave..
bad,"Only worked there for like 6 months. Gave them my school schedule and they ignored it and kept scheduling me for times i was in class, and then were upset with me when i didn't show up. other cashiers were great but the managers were hit and miss. "
bad,Terrible management would always take away more and more hours away from my department. The clerks at the front end were just kids they hired and they got paid just as much as I did even though I worked my rear end off while they pushed a broom in one hand and gazed at their phones in the other.
bad,"The mangers at Safeway are the worse mangers I have ever seen. They violate labor laws, they are racist and disguising people. They treated the employees like they were slaves with no rights. That's why they are always hiring because no-one could stay in that environment. The bakery mangers would work you with no breaks for hours. Not a nice place to work."
bad,"never move you up and write you up so you can not move up"
bad,"I was hired at Safeway in my junior year of high school and worked there for a little over a year. Over that year, I was promised multiple raises and promotions because I had a work ethic unlike my coworkers, which made the store function smoothly. What I received were empty promises with countless pushbacks and picking up more slack from other people who would abuse your productivity. I was actually medically advised to quit because at age 18, I was diagnosed with severe tendonitis (which could have easily led to carpal tunnel syndrome), acute chest pains, and was drastically underweight (125 lbs at 5'10""). It was a terrible experience and I would never recommend working for Safeway."
bad,"Started off as part time job as courtesy clerk, advanced to general merchandise clerk. Payed very poorly for doing lots of hard physical labor. Didnt even get my 25 cent per hour raise till months after I should have."
bad,"Did not feel fulfilled on a regular basis, and made the choice to leave the company. Management was very poor, and was never treated in a good manner."
bad,Terrible management. Only looking after themselves. Would throw people under the bus all the time. Terrible management of weekly hours for workers to have a stable work environment.
bad,"I was the only decorator employed for most of my time there. Others were variously hired, but none had experience and there was no way to do all the work myself and training someone that had zero experience. After holding the position for almost two years alone, they finally found someone with experience as my backup. Then they started giving her all my hours, and when I called my union rep, the store manager told me that as long as I had 1 more hours than her, he was within the counselors. I was the senior decorator, so I got more hours. He didn't like that I called the union, so he gave her my day shifts and wanted me to work the late shifts. That didn't work out with my family very well, and it also didn't work well for her schedule either. She quit and I started having health problems."
bad,They let the department management take out employs off work hours asked to have people work off the clock don't pay you for the over time if not asked to work over 8 hours. And the store manager will let the department manager date other managers or people in charge of the day to day over seeing.
bad,Extremely Stressful with varying ideas of how the department i was in should be run. miss communication was very common. as well as word of mouth rumors while the person was not on shift
bad,"Not a fun place to work...unrealistic expectations of ALL employees and management. No appreciation or acknowledgement of work well done."
bad,You can easily fall behind in the job if you’re not always on your toes. Costumers are  always pleasant and make the long shift easier. Union reps usually there for you in crisis situations.
bad,don't work here  Managers socket prioritizing what's more important when it comes to putting product on the shelves versus how the shelf looks constantly b**** about you calling out even if you are sick have no remorse for loss in the family
bad,"Work place culture was not kind.  It was an old fashion company when I worked there (ties and no jeans) despite working in IT.  The company has sense been purchased by Albertsons, perhaps it has changed for the better."
bad,"typical day at work included fighting over what piece of equipment you would get for the work day with other employees, hardest part of the job is being able to adapt to the speed/pace at which they expect of you. the only beneficial part of the job is being paid on a weekly basis, as well as the benefits. work environment is a bit abrasive, and it is extremely fast paced. supervisors and managers do not no the definition of the word ""empathy"" as they refuse to understand when/why a job was not completed within company standards. most if not all supervisors are dismissive, and rude, and if you make a mistake, no matter what you say; it's YOUR fault. very lacking in employment diversity, and a rowdy environment where you have to have high seniority to be able to challenge any of the decisions made by management or staff. furthermore there is no understanding for needing to take time off if a family member is sick. has to be immediate family (brother/sister/grandparent/parent) to count as being excused...unacceptable."
bad,"thy have a habbet of suspending you for the smallest thing for a week "
bad,"Management is poorly run,I told them I can't not work weekend because of another job that same week they scheduled me in for 2 weeks of weekend shifts. Co-workers seem to hate their job.i hear a lot of complaints from costumers about how poor they were treated.the lines are long my co-workers are lazy I'm the one who's stuck doing most of the work because I'm one of the only ines who knows how to close.overall if I find another part-time job I will leave and would not recommend any body to work here"
bad,"My first few weeks at this job were okay, but as soon as one of the worst supervisors got promoted to a ""front 'manager'"" position is when everything went downhill for me. The work environment is very toxic. Co-workers talk behind your back and rumors are spread all over about everyone. Even the managers are involved in all the drama. Management shows favoritism and sometimes even discrimination. I would often get chewed out for taking initiative while others would chill in the meat department for hours and nothing would happen to them. "
bad,Don't waste your time with this company. Right now morale all across the board is shot at best. It's so bad the even ops wouldn't come back to work store level.
bad,Store Manager was the worst and had no idea how to make a schedule. Treats employees with disrespect and treats their jobs lower than her own. All around poor leader and treats her workers poorly.
bad,"They either give you not enough, or too many hours. Many people are not getting the pay they deserve. Its a multi billion dollar corporation, you as an employee do not matter to them."
bad,"Management cared more about profits than about customer satisfaction and product quality, which often led to a difficult and uncomfortable work environment. Because of that, ultimately everyone who was initially hired for the new Cut Fruit department at the Union City Safeway left within three months. "
bad,"you can get hired for whatever position you want but even if they hire you for that position you'll never get it regardless of your work ethic"
bad,"I worked for Safeway for 5 years. I was a Courtesy Clerk(bagged groceries), Cake Decorator, Starbucks Barista and Deli Clerk. Union does affect transferring to new departments because they could be under a different contract. You will work weekends and most Holidays but you do get Holiday pay. Your shifts won't be set unless you have seniority which there is a lot of employees who have 20 plus years seniority. Some really great employees but some store managers are conceited and talk down to you. Some store managers are humble and aren't too good to go get carts while the store is busy but that trait I've only seen in 1 store manager out of 6 store managers I've worked for. Don't expect to be a full time employee right away due to Seniority too."
bad,"I'm mentally and psychologically disabled and all of managment was aware of my disabilities and the limitations they leave me with and were completely non-accommodating, even yelling at me for having a PTSD attack while I was taking out the trash."
bad,"worst management ever....little or no ""promised hours"" that was promised at signing, and, being lied to at signing about having your Union Initiation Fees being paid for you....never again."
bad,This store has gone so far down hill. Management is new and has done nothing to fix this store the whole place is in shambles and is hard to deal with. No proper training and leveling up or transferring out is almost near impossible. The employees are amazing but the company needs a lot of work.
bad,"You punch in, get your paper work and keys, get your truck, hook up to a trailer and deliver the skids to the various stores in Calgary and the surrounding area.  Usually a driver will do a 2-4 trailers a night.   Most of the shifts are afternoons, 4pm until 1am."
bad,I enjoyed learning different aspects of meat and cheeses but the manager and I did not get along as the manager kept disappearing when needed.
bad,"A typical day at work would be to clock in and sign the safety sheet at the customer service center then do a curtosy walk around the store to see if any customers need any help, Helping them with sliced meat and cheese, preparing and organizing salads, cooking, serving customers, ringing them up, cleaning fryers,ovens, dishes, sinks, counters, soup bar, salad bar, mopping sweeping, making sandwiches, taking out trash. Management is bad, they cut hours and expect too much out of 1 person, only 2 people to close a whole deli by a set time and no overtime is allowed. I learned how to manage the back end and front counter of a deli.My co workers were ok, but some of them had bad attitudes and were unwilling to do specific tasks when asked to do so. The hardest part of my job was fulfilling all the assigned tasks in a small amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was end of closing when I get to go home for the evening."
bad,i worked at safeway for about 6 months. i started in the fuel station was moved to cart boy and then to deli. the whole time i was there it was obvious there was no room to move up. as the people with seniority got everything and the new blood was left poor wages and made to do more work than the managers. when i tried to quit my manager came to my house and yelled at me right in front of my parents
bad,"Could never expect to move up in the company. I was asked to train new employees for positions I had applied for, but was told even though I filled in for these positions that I wouldn't get the job but was encouraged to keep applying."
bad,"There is not enough time to get your work done. Management at some stores do not support Department Managers. Upper management ignores"
bad,Poor management! poor hours there is better jobs out there. Don't work for Vons. You will hate it ! & all the benefits take awhile and raise pay rate  sucks.
bad,Hours werent great. Managers were rude. Not suggested to work here at all.
bad,I was miserable because I worked for a union and didn't make a lot of money.
bad,"typical day at work was spent at the register scanning/bagging merchandise, speaking with customers and helping them find what they needed. i learned its not what you know,its who you know. management was mediocre and thats a compliment. not all but some were the worst most inconsiderate people i have ever met. and there was like 2 asst mgrs that were the sweetest of the sweet. the store manager was actually a cool guy but they got rid of him fast, i knew more than a couple of the shift managers...hows that? i dont know but they were always asking me for help. no one cared for your schedule or were petty if you voiced your opinion, was being groomed to work in human resources, but as soon as i spoke up to the hr lady's secret asst. manager boyfreind i got demoted..smh sorry i aint butt kisser.. i wanted to move to another department that i was interested in that needed help and one manager refused to let me. co workers were cool, no one was mean or crazy. hardest part of the job was the pay, not enough to do anything with unless you were a teenager, not someone with a family to support and bills to pay, not enough hours were given for my availability even though i specified them on my application. i had met a girl who worked for 3 years at a location i was training at and i was making almost as much as she was!!! crazy!! they seriously dont pay enough and have the nerve to make you join the union, and they dont give you the dues back once you leave as they promised. most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, they were really nice and always appreciative. the location"
bad,I'm am going to have to keep my opinions to myself but I will say yhis no amount of money or security will ever be worth losing my pride my confidence or sanity
bad,"good for a pay check and nothing else . Will change your scedule from 4-10s to 5-8s and tell you to bad you have to find a sitter for your kids , dont call in sick unless you bring proof from a doctor , dont expect any help from managment when possible problens come up they say""I can interpit the contract any way I want"""
bad,I worked in the deli but needed to be moved out of the deli because of arthritis in my thumbs. When positions opened up the new manager (who had been harassing me since he started)told me he wouldn't give me the job and would only keep me in the deli.
bad,The company doesn't care about the senior employee of the company we have given our life and tears for this company and now they turn their backs on us after we have made them millions
bad,"Not the best place to work. Very cliquey, not great benefits. Since sobeys took over it’s gotten worse. Pay was okay for the work, but I felt very unwelcome within the store . Don’t want to go back"
bad,"I expected to work full time, but instead I would get 20 hours or less per week.  After a year I could qualify to get benefits.   It was Union and I had to pay my dues each paycheck.   The manager was pushy bossy arrogant and intimidating.  Sometimes she would berate employees in front of customers"
bad,"Low salary, poor management, other employees didn't do their jobs, depressing, unsanitary, understaffed, staff was generally not polite to customers, overall bad experience"
bad,The manager was very prejudice against her on kind. She would be late all the time. Then question and wrote up other employees when they were late. Never trained us properly. She always came to work with an attitude.
bad,I did not like working here. Management did not appreciate you at all. you are often mistreated if you are under 30 years old. There are no real benefits to working at Safeway besides a paycheck.
bad,"if Your a man your fine if your a woman you will be treated not the greatest. "
bad,I work in the bakery department and we are at constant odds with management regarding availability of hours. Corporate never seems to allow enough hours for our department to accomplish even the most basic tasks that are required to be completed daily. The position is stressful and can be emotionally and mentally exhausting.
bad,Worst place to work. Management  is mean and lazy and the store shows it. They worship customers  so they pretend and abuse the employees ive seen every manager act up and not care about anything but their numbers. Pay in minimum deli dept is disgusting . Dirty floors slicers sinks drawers refrigerators  not cleaned and management  does not care. They are arec too busy talking while the dept falls apart. Angry customers  waiting  in line because safeway will not hire.Greedy sick company!
bad,"Started working for this company at age 16 as a courtesy and ended up in pharmacy. Worked most positions in the store such as checker, customer service and floral. Retirement was terrible but health benefits were reasonable. Typical corporate situation..never enough help to keep up work load and no organization. I dreaded coming to work everyday. Good place to start out and I learned a lot but move on!"
bad,"Was pregnant and was being moved around to areas I wasn't legally certified to work in (without any training), tried to get me to move heavy shipments around regardless of my pregnancy and was overall just trained poorly for my original position as cashier."
bad,"Clock in, scan items and provide good customer service. Not really an exciting job but it gets you through the day. Management is terrible, there's no communication from management to the employees and management will be negative if you bring up a personal issue. People who been there for the longest time, tend to gossip and spread rumors which affects the workplace and new employees alike. Breaks or ""lunch"" is pretty wild.  You will get one 10 min. break, if you work 4-6 hrs. and a one 15 min. break if you work an 7-7 1/2hr. shift. Which you probably don't have time to eat and use the restroom in that timeframe. If you go a couple minutes over, the floor manager will probably lecture you about going over your break. Above all, it's better to work somewhere different."
bad,"As a company they don't care about their employees, they pay them a below living wage and cut hours and take their positions. They don't call them slaveway for no reason"
bad,The job sucks because union takes 2/3 of your paycheck while the rest is taken by taxes. Good luck trying to live in Santa Rosa California with paystubs like safeways
bad,"But Albertsons Safeway was the most stressful job I have ever worked. The moment I got off of work I was counting down the hours until I had to be back. There was a constant sense of dread. There was no training or constructive criticism, the culture was he said she said, and heresay meant more than proven results. Perhaps it was the location, perhaps it's the culture of the company, but I would not recommend working for Albertsons Safeway."
bad,Store management is good but pharmacy management needs work. Not enough staff creating a stressful work environment. Insurance benefits a plus. Retirement plan a plus.
bad,"this is an okay job, best for people right out of high school to have an easy job while making decent money working. this could potentially get you through school if you play your cards right. This company has no reason to keep long term employees because they just dont care how great you are. but make fat money until u get a better job and dumb them like a high school date."
bad,The Bakery department demanded too much while they kept cutting our hours and not paying enough to make a living. They pressure us to do so much in so little time.
bad,the hardest part of my job is the fact that there is no work place balance and no appreciation for the 10 -12 hour shifts day in and day. there Is no balance
bad,"•	Select merchandise for shipment and stack on pallet neatly by using a pallet jack or fork lift."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of working with great coworkers but there was never enough as there were lines out the door constantly.  Management was very lazy, they had control over a manager's card and the cashiers had to wait for them to walk from the back to the front of the store. The hardest part of this job was making every customer happy as they waited in line to pay for their groceries. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with, they made the job bearable."
bad,"The management in this company are living in a fantasy land. They don't fully understand what their workers go through. They are all about numbers and reports. They overload their back rooms with product, knowing that they need to only sell 65% of seasonal product to make a profit. They really don't care about anything but their bottom line. When they merged with Albertson's, everything went downhill. Their customer service desks have buzzers for you to hit so that somebody will show up and help you. Only a company who values the all mighty dollar over customers' and employees' happiness would do that."
bad,Labor budgets are not enough to do a good job.  If you are ok feeling like you didn't do a good job everyday then this is your job.  Upper management is very demeaning when talking to employees.  If they do not do it in your face they will behind your back.
bad,"Over three years i never received a raise or promotion. It was always minimum wage. Free Healthcare but if you work here, you qualify as low income anyways. If you do get a job there, just make sure to not stay too long. I think its a good job for someone in high school/college or as a first job but its not a career!!!"
bad,"working for Safeway was stressful due to requested days of for doctors appointments, family emergencies, and low pay. for as much hassle and stresses and even if you had full time hours, you are unable to afford to live on your own, let alone with kids"
bad,the union really messes everything up  for you the pay sucks management sucks the staff is lazy and the guest are very rude. they just don't care about the employees at all.
bad,"I was punished for requesting Thursdays off. I was given 5 five hour days. Therefore, unable to work more days or hours. The department was union and the contract, that I left under was going to add .25 only for the next five years. NOTE that is not .25 for each year, but only a quarter as a pay raise for five years."
bad,"none, Not a good culture. Benefits were good.  Out of town stores work more with the employee's then Phoenix based stores.  It is all about who you know.  Give up your personal life and you will get hours that is the expectations."
bad,"Everyone who works there for a living hates their job and hate the corporation. The company will do anything to save a few dollars at the employees expense. If you're a younger person who is doing this just as a first job, you will be paid minimum wage and then on top of that you will have to pay union dues to a union who does absolutely nothing for you, so you will essentially be paid under minimum wage."
bad,"The job was stressful, because of the manager of the department was never following regulations or health codes for the most part and I tried to follow them as best as I could to make up for his lack of effort in them. The manager would blame other people for his mistakes."
bad,I loved working there but they only use you for the probation period and they go by your ethnicity i never missed a day was never late worked over time and i know i beet the probation period they set me up to fail i was on karts and they called me in to help someone with sweeps so when i clocked in i was two minutes late on sweeps and they terminated me i worked there twice second time was on me.
bad,"Poor communication within the managers. Pay raises go based on the amount of hours you work, i.e. you have to work 600 hours before your first pay raise."
bad,"In my years working there, working for Safeway made me very unhappy. I wasn't paid very much, and worked many hours. It was very depressing and I don't have anything nice to say about this company."
bad,a very stressful environment to attempt to grow and develop a team. district management teams are more than willing to replace anyone at any time for any reason. job security is two star.
bad,"If you're lucky enough to get a good manager, you might be okay at this job. However, managers at Safeway change all the time and it is likely that you will also get some bad managers as well.  The only reason I would recommend this job to a friend is because it's easy to get hired and hard to get fired because of the union."
bad,"come in start my cooking and regular duties. I learded that i have to look out for myself because as much as they smile in your face they dont mean well. management has 0 cares about anyone especially if your trying to better yourself. hardest part of the job is working 6 days a week while going to school, volunteering and having tutoring to attend and you ask for another day off and they say NO! leaving is the most enjoyable part of the job"
bad,The reason I've been with Safeway so long is because it was a great place to work but in the past 5 years it's gotten harder and harder. They treat they're management team like slave
bad,I didnt like it there very bad exprience alot of drama with  some of the people there. Some managers there were excessive with managment postiions and very un fair and mean
bad,I was a cashier was'nt getting as many hrs I should and it seem like i was over working myself and never had those times reflected on my stub. dealt and met a lot of diverse people. even de
bad,I worked at the check out and made sure always to help the customer with whatever they needed. I would get they carry out service and would ask them if they found what they were looking for. I would get another employee to run and grab things for them.
bad,"Safeway is a great company to work for however, I can't say the managers at my store are great to work for. The managers I work for have favorites and if your not one of them then your basically nothing. Lots of unfair treatment in my store and not just towards me but I see it happen to others as well. Sorry to say, but its the truth."
bad,management sucks all they do is cut hours play favorites and talk on cell phones then expect everyone else to pick up their slack. ineffective management from upper level down to store level
bad,"Worked here for 5 months and had to quit. Was draining in every sense of the word and completely not worth the money. They expected me to do the work of two people, stay during a blizzard and, had me work alone the Friday before valentine's in the bakery. Highly don't recommend."
bad,"The bakery position I was in had too many tasks that were difficult to impossible to get done by myself in the amount of time I was given. In addition to those tasks I was also responsible for helping customers, answering the phones, and taking cake orders. I was so stressed out that I asked for help or to move to a different department and was basically told to deal with it, and move faster, or to quit but that if I quit I would have wasted the company's time and money since they ""spent $5,000 to hire me."" I felt very disrespected by how the store manager talked to me and tried to make me feel guilty for not wanting to work some where that made me feel overwhelmed and stressed with no help."
bad,"The demands of the fast paced production Job is under appreciated due to the interests of management to save store costs by limiting the persons hours, often cutting them tremendously, and not giving the employer opportunity for advancement in pay for at least three years while refusing to barely pay their employers above minimum wage. My coworkers and I get along great."
bad,"management was unfair to employees, as well as unorganized . there was no consistency with policy and procedure. upper management was unrealistic with expectations."
bad,"they don't care about keeping they're commit to promised raises, and treat you very unfairly. i never caused a problem for my manager, even considering she didn't give me the raise that she promised me when i was hired, as well as not being able to schedule correctly to my only days available, constantly found myself being scheduled hours that interfered with previous education and work commitments."
bad,"I very high demanding job with very little benefit. This company will work you to death if you allow them too. The company has very unattainable standards, I highly recommend not working for this company in the future as a store director."
bad,Management only cares for themselves only. Payment was good co workers were nice. The way the store was run was less than functional.
bad,"Fired after three months, no notice, they weren't even going to tell me until I finished my shift. I noticed that the following weeks schedule had my name but no hours, half way through my shift I asked the manager what was going on and he told me I was being let go. He also said he was INSTRUCTED to not tell me until my shift ended. I never met the owner, one manager complained about me while three others vouched for me to stay. Hours were HIGHLY inconsistent, sometimes I opened, sometimes I closed. I would sometimes work one day a week and others Id work 7. Many times I would close then open the next day giving me no time to clean my uniform for the following day. Often asked to do more then I could complete in the time span given and was also fired for going slowly on a task to ensure it was done well. I often did not have time to take my five minute break then would be lectured for not taking it."
bad,"The people were great, I loved interacting with the public it was just that the pay was horrible and management did not treat everyone equal."
bad,"They hire you and you are ""on call"" from 9-11 and 2-4 never knowing IF you will work that day or not... then you have to make it through 6 months of probation.... good luck. They fire everyone no matter how good you are 2 weeks before you are a permanent safeway employee.  So, don't say I didn't warn you."
bad,the task can be very redundant. Does not provide a lot of challenges and management has a click that you need to pretend to like to get your job done.
bad,"A typical day would usually start off retrieving carts, bagging the majority of my shift. And there would be the occasional spill, clean bathrooms everyday and anything else that needed cleaning. What I learned is to make sure everything is clean, be friendly with costumers, bag appropriately and smile. "
bad,safeway had the worst mangers i have ever worked with they were late didnt know how to deal with certain situations.
bad,"Manager admitted to spreading rumours about co workers."
bad,"Safeway has a severe lack of communication between management and employees.  Their solution to most problems is to put a band-aid on a situation rather than looking for a long term solution.  Additionally, Safeway does not treat their employees very well when dealing with workman's compensation situations.  Management has told an employee with a sprained knee and another with a concussion to ""take an ibuprofen and go back to work"".  Safeway also does not utilize a proper work schedule, often leaving a single employee to work an entire department during busy times, not allowing that employee a chance to take a break or lunch themselves.  While the benefits and compensation are pretty solid, and there is definitely much room for advancement, the negatives more than outweigh any positives about working for Safeway."
bad,"Poor management, no set schedule, don't get days off even when requested a month in advance, barely any days off, overload of petty work to do, no proper training, disrespectful management too concerned with your own personal life and not your job duties, you get yelled at for little mistakes while a employee who has been there the same amount of time doesn't , required to work extra hours even during a 3am shift, disorganized work area, only a 15 minute break for an 8hr shift."
bad,"They ran you ragged and then complained when you were too exhausted to go any further. "
bad,"Hell on earth. Especially at tgis Burlingame store where the space in the back is nothing but a mess. When your load comes in you cant walk normal anymore. Either you walk sideways or not at all. The place in the back is so small' literally. The sales floor is too big one person can't work and finish putting out the product on your own. The store mgr. Expect you too finish but you can't. You drop whatever youre doing when they call you to check. But they expect you to finish on Time. The asst mgrs who are so stiff scared of the store mgr even sacrifice their own time by working for free just so they could finish the job that the selfish and hypocrite store mgr. Gives them. They literally work for free which is a violation of the union contract. The closing mgr is still a union member position a scapegoat position for the first assistant, whom I know for a fact is a brown nose to the store mgr, whom I know by reputation treats all his employees like slaves. This particular store mgr in Burlingame, safeway on Howard, is a death sentence for any employee that gets transferred here. The store mgr. Here will threathen you, demean and look down on you like you are some piece of toilet item if he doesn't like you work. If you dont kiss his ring, you wont get his blessings. So you as good as dead. The worst store I have ever been in. The neighborhood is made up mostly of rich BUT VERY CHEAP individuals or community that wants first class products for free. What cheap people. And what a incompetent, and disrespectfull and hypocrite store manager who will charm you if you are a wealthy"
bad,Bad company to work for. Basically exploits you and will screw you over any chance it gets.
bad,the people suck in the deil. they were always rude to you and if they dont like you they will get you fierd.
bad,i clocked in and went right to work .I worked every dept. except meat dept.They were a different union.I made a lot of friends with co-workers and customers.The worst part was I mostly got late shift.My boss said he knew i would get everything done to close the store.I enjoyed keeping busy and the pay.
bad,"Too many meetings, and a CIO who can't make decisions. The CIO has been in this position for 20 years, and refuses to take risk. Management is a stuck in ""status quo"" mode."
bad,Customer Service is a pleasure to serve the customers and employees and management are wonderful to work with. Superior Service  was actually to serve the customers and please in the  customer to the fullest.
bad,"Im sure it has changed since i worked there but when i was there they defiantly didn't make it feel like its an work environment that being a ""team player"" matters imagine being a bookkeeper moved to the deli dpt because a paperclip or rubber band on the floor made the office as a whole dirty and it could be no one other then you who made those God awful mistakes. this one defiantly had they're favorites and no matter how hard you worked it wouldn't amount to anything? if you weren't liked you were fired for the smallest reasons period."
bad,"While I enjoyed working with some of my coworkers, the department and store management was abysmal. My schedule was all over the place after having been there for over 3 years and it changed every single week.  I was accidentally injured at work by my manager and was required by a doctor to take a month off of work. When I returned I was no longer the assistant manager. I was told by store management that I was the best worker in the produce department and even got employee of the month.  I worked very hard and after my injury everything went downhill. I had good management early on, but when it switched to bad management, there was nothing I could do.  I DO NOT recommend for anyone to work there!"
bad,Worked there for 2 years and worked my butt off. You feel totally unappreciated. Felt like a number not an employee. My mother was dieing in the hospital and all my manager was worried about was a doctor's note. Don't want to work for a company that has no compassion for their employees. I quit.
bad,"Not the best place to work. They work how the customers want and not what is actually needed, or logically. After I leave, it's over. Never going back."
bad,"Been there 7 years need to move on, not the the same company I started at age of 16. Employees over worked, creates negative environment. No work/life balance."
bad,Thought it was a full-time job but it goes by seniority so I mostly got less than 30. Horrible training for a big corporation. management could care less about there employees if they tried. Would not recommend even applying I applied to produce then they said oo we don't have an opening there.
bad,"I was an assistant deli manager. As a deli clerk, the work itself was easy to learn. Unfortunately, I had a lazy, unorganized manager. I'd come in to supervise for the day and he wouldn't grab the frozen load or he forgot to order chickens AGAIN. I felt as if I were his babysitter, always picking up after him. I brought it up to the store manager and he told me it was ""my job to help him"". In my opinion there is a difference between helping him and constantly doing his job for him. Somedays I would be drowning in backstock other days I would barely have enough product for the day. "
bad,"I was a delivery driver and it was just kicking off in Houston. Management was a total joke. The routes were insane, and the work too much for 1 person. Not surprisingly it failed. Everyone was laid off."
bad,"The bare minimum entry level job as a customer service drone. No one wanted to be there, no one was paid enough, no one expected to be there next year."
bad,I feel like safeway could have been a good fit for me only because I was doing the type of work I want to do but the fact that they take money out of your paycheck just to be an employee due the fact that they are uinion and a certain dollar amount had to be paid for each month employed there and they took it straight from our pay..if you were lucky enough to work hours that were worth working and making it through to the next paycheck.
bad,I really have a good experience from Safeway and i really want to go back to my jop cause of the pay and especially the cow workers. I can pay for my bills and still have money for my kids.
bad,Management cares about thier bottom line only. The work model for the pharmacy at least in the short time I worked there was less help and more work they pushed this to the absolute extreme. In summary ypu work as hard as you possibly can with a team of two or three only to come in the next day with things worse off. This continues until the patient's are so angry they go to corporate. Then you get 2-3 extra people for a day get caught up only to have the whole cycle repeat again. Although they will hire uncertified technicians and train you with compensation for school.
bad,Was not a very nice place to work. It was nice at first but i had a whole 2 weeks of vacation robbed from me because even though i tried to make sure it was my time to take it and upper management telling me it was fine to take it it was not actually and i lost 2 weeks of pay for no reason
bad,"the company just treats their people like garbage. you are treated like a number and not a human being. there is no support from the union and the customers always come last, which isn't the way I like to operate. customers are always first in my mind."
bad,Loved working with my co-workers but management very toxic. They stress out the good employees but let the employees who never work and/or call out sick constantly get away with so much.
bad,"At Safeway (and I use ""safe"" loosely), I was thrown into the most stressful environment of my working career. While the law says you have the right to choose whether you work overtime or not, you aren't given much of a choice, you will either be guilt-tripped into staying with the classic; ""Well that wouldn't be doing ME any favors..."" line, or they will keep giving you more stuff to do so you don't have time to look at a clock. The managers are greedy snakes who will purposely leave Night Crew, or the Courtesy Clerks understaffed to boost their bonuses (so I'm told/rumors swirl). "
bad,"It was a first job so it was getting me by barely, but I wouldn’t recommend this. Coworkers were somewhat cool, but other were just there cuz they couldn’t leave."
bad,"After only a short period of time working at Safeway, it became clear that harassment was something that happened everyday with everyone. Fellow cashiers came in crying during my training period. They said that harassment was normal and they just had to deal with it by crying in the break room. I quit soon after."
bad,I had an awful experience working here. The managers didn't communicate with each other and got mad at employees for doing what another manager told them to do. One of them didn't know I'd handed in my notice and tried to teach me new tasks on my last day. Employee retention for this position was terrible which often meant I was the only one working on some days. Customers yelled at me for cleaning the other gender's bathroom when no one else was available.
bad,My hours fluctuated from 12 at night to 6 am start and would work anywhere from 5 hours to 12 hours depending on the work load or lack of staff. Was never given the staff i asked for to complete the job that was assigned and hours were allocated to the department. Had to take calls weekly on days off about issues and how to fix them. Pay raises didn't happen unless you threatened to quit
bad,"I liked working at safeway at first but after 3 years and absolutely no raise no opportunity for advancement. This company will literally try to work you to the bone. Overworked for nothing but a min wage job and broken promises, management too afraid to deal with any issues regarding a department"
bad,"Safeway cares very little for the safety and well-being of their employees."
bad,"Provide high-quality customer service in accordance with Safeway’s customer service standards and policies and procedures."
bad,go in at various times always short handed and managment treated employees poorly hard to advance  and no one in corperate office was willing to listen to complaints about poor managment
bad,"absolutely hated management, absolutely no help, if you ever had an issue they were never helpful and I would always feel belittled when I had an issue. Management are bullies who dont know how to do their job. If you are coming into the store as a fresh face, be prepared to be talked down to, not only from management but from the ""lifers"""
bad,Management is terrible here. You don't get paid what you should. Everyone only looks after themselves. The only good thing about safeway is you're union so you can't just get fired. I would not recommend anyone join the safeway company.
bad,"As a member of management, the upper management treats you very badly.  They will speak to you in very agressive ways that if you spoke to your employees that way they would repremand you.  The work expectation for management is unreasonable.  If your sales were low you would have to work 6 or 7 days a week and cut non salaried employees so that your store will make labor.  The management team is bullied by the upper management."
bad,it needs there improment on there hours and days and there sales othere then that its  a job a and I bag groceries and stock selves and help customers out to there car when needed
bad,I use to love my job here its a lot of work but the people around the work place make it fun since management change and sobeys change over its just not the same
bad,"With the exception of my direct supervisor and a couple of my fellow managers, management is a joke at this company. 1/10 would not apply again unless i absolutely 100% had to"
bad,Everything at Safeway was great but they left me with no hours over a period of 4 weeks. This caused me to look for other work to support myself through school.
bad,It a good place to start but if your able to find other employment do it! Management is horrible and is more concerned about displays being filled then the shelves and is not concerned about your well being. They claim they have flexible scheduling but that never happens. Store is always messy and has a problem with theft and homeless people hanging out at the front entrance. The atmosphere is very quick and chaotic and it can be very hard to try to finish tasks when other employees and management is calling you. It's very hard to obtain raises. The union is ok but not the best. If you do get employment don't stay for long it's not worth it.
bad,Some co-workers had nasty attitudes.  I was discriminated by management. No one would listen to what I had to say.  Hours were good and job wasn't bad.  The people were bad.
bad,"am posting a 2nd review, since the first one never got posted."
bad,"I did not like working at this job. The co-workers were not friendly. Although I didn't like the job, I learned about customer service. The only enjoyable part was seeing customers smile. The hardest part was gathering carts, because there was times where I almost gotten hit by people who weren't paying attention."
bad,"Although I love my job, it is the most unpredictable job I have ever had. I never know how many hours I will be scheduled for. It might be 48 or 24. I never know if I am going to get bumped hours by someone who has been there longer than I (more senior employees can take your hours if they feel they didn't get enough). I never know if I am going to get my regular minimum wage or management pay (I only get management pay if no other managers are there). It does not matter how good your work ethics are or how motivated you are, seniority at Safeway rules. They have been cutting hours to the point where employees who are considered ""part-time"" might only get 1 or 2 4-7 hour days. If you could get on as a ""full-time"" employee, it wouldn't be a bad company to work for, but how does one survive during the transitioning period between making peanuts to cashews?"
bad,"Von's/Safeway is among the many employers that do not pay cost-of-living wages. Most full time employees live in poverty, and depend on support from family and government in order to avoid homelessness and starvation. At the same time, they generally do not have enough flexibility for employees that want a second job."
bad,"What I learned is there is always something to do in the service industry, but with difficult management and little opportunity for advancement the work life was difficult."
bad,"productive workplace busy never a dull moment what I have learned is patience, my co workers are very interesting individuals, there is nothing hard about the job just show up making a difference is the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"This job will teach you how to follow instructions, cope with other people and work with a team.  It does not encourage initiative and thinking out side of the box however."
bad,"Pro Female, Company does't abide by all union rules. Pay and benefits great."
bad,"Great atmosphere to work with the public"
bad,"I love working with the coworkers I have but ever since my pregnancy management has made it hard at work. I had a doctors note for work restraints because I was pregnant and they broke the doctors note and still had me pushing carts and lifting heavy items which caused me to leave early due to spotting. Now I am returning and am only able to work Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday due to child care mainly, school, and transportation restraints. The managers have worked with one girl's full time school schedule, and then her other full time job. I was called and told that he could only work with my requests for a few weeks till I decide what I want to do. (Aka quite or work the days and times they want). He told me that I am freezing up their scheduling block (even tho I requested a full shift because from twain Harte, to day care, and to work is not worth a 4hr shift which Safeway is known for). He continued to say they he couldn't guarantee me 24 hrs (enough hrs to get insurance), but another co-worker requested 24 hrs instead of 40 so she could spend time with her child and husband who works grave shift and was denied the cut hours but he couldn't guarantee me at least 24 hours a week. I got my schedule after this conversation with Jeff and was scheduled a day I didn't have child care! Had to call and fix it and he accused me of saying that I could work less than I originally stated (which I informed him was not true). Would not recommend this place for anyone to work at. Jeff Hampton and Denise camara are completely corrupt, play favoritism in the work place, conveniently lose"
bad,"A day at work is usually occupied with much to do with the customers and lots of fun with coworkers."
bad,"Stress is a number one thing at safeway, unfairly treated, work fast a hard with no respect and over worked."
bad,"Only if you need extra cash, should you ever apply to Safeway to work. It's not a great place to go career. I have been there for 3 years and I'm just not making $9.15/ hr. But they would always cut hours or hire too many people, even if they know, they don't make enough. Its not a good place, if you are trying to make a living or make ends meet."
bad,At Safeway I learned to ringout customers on the register. I Learned how to scan items. I Also learned how to procces payments and make change. I've learned how to balance drawers and greet customers. management could be better but it's okay. I have great and friendly co workers that I enjoy working with. The hardest part of my job is making sure the customers alway satistfied. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the the customers face when they have recieved great service.
bad,i have worked differen positions at Safeway. I currently work as a All Purpose Clerk. i work 8 hours a day without a single break to sit. The managment that i work for is rude and tends to care more about sales then about employees. I work at 4 in the morning until noon where i stock the bread.Then i fill out all the the paperwork that shows how much we are producing and distressing. I then rap all of the baked good by myself until 8 in the morning when my coworker comes in. i finish that up and start mixing dough; all while assisting custumers with their needs. i do the production for the day and then sit in manager meeting to discuss the weeks sales and how to improve. The hardest part of my job is that i get very little sleep and i go to college and have a hard time doing all of my homework. the most enjoyable part of my job is the custumers that come in and put a smile on my face.
bad,"Just wasn't for me. I downgraded in this job do to the economy crashing. Low pay, high school kids received more hours than adults and management, they talk to you any kind of way. Was not for me."
bad,Your job was always being threatened.
bad,I really dont have any comments concerning this job.I am glad im nt dare.
bad,"Management is comeplety disrespectful , Racial Profiling , under paid work , drama in the work envierment, unapid overtime , expecting more work with less people"
bad,The manager and her bully assistant manager are heartless. The meat department manager hid sardines in a coworkers area. The other twisted managers thought it was funny.
bad,"Over works you and couldn’t keep a consistent schedule , makes jr very difficult to plan anything , and the manager on mission street was just rude and not professional"
bad,"Lazy workers and poor management, unsanitary conditions from bathroom's backing up into deli. Shifts being changed without letting you know and then you get a write up."
bad,Interviewed for a management position and was offered the next position down(assistant). For weeks I worked under someone who had less than two weeks of experience and knew nothing(obviously). Turns out this person above me was friends with the overall store manager and was given the job because so.  Had to constantly fix Mistakes from my manager until the day he stepped down from his position.
bad,"Management was terrible, there was absolutely no communication. I had to go through multiple people for the answer to one question. Important information was not relayed to higher management, and managers really showed favoritism."
bad,"if you really need a job, then this might be the place for you. when i worked for Safeway, i was given anywhere from 7 - 20 hour per week and i believe they offer benefits. i left due to the need for more hours and better pay"
bad,"Loved wprking alongside leople of similar mindset, casual work environent with busy fast paced atmosphere. Great balance ofr freindliness amd professionalism."
bad,"My experience with Safeway had some good qualities, and if you work hard it's relatively easy to advance. However, stores are frequently understaffed, management had little to no organization and employees are treated poorly. At Safeway I experienced poor time management, unsafe work conditions, and even illegal activity (one example would be management making people work off the clock). While not every Safeway store may operate this way, and each store is a *somewhat* different experience, there are far too many that do function this way and sometimes create hostile/unsafe work environments."
bad,"10 years of busting my a s s, doing what the men did and NEVER was promoted. The don’t care about their employees."
bad,"I have currently been with this company for 8 months, I can count that at least twice a month there are times where management is inconsiderate to your feelings in how they speak to you. Most of the time they are verbally abusive when a situation arises instead of bringing it to a private setting stating what happened and then stating the protocols for said violation no matter how big or small. They are unprofessional in the way they treat their employees, they do not consider anyone an asset. An example of this was I made a goal to become an asset to the company but they seem to not see that. I do the following jobs or have been trained in the following jobs to do at anytime they need someone. Checker, Self-Checkout, Dairy, overnight checker, overnight stocker, over night tags for new sales, General Merchandise, overtime when needed, come in on my days off, worked 14 to 17 days straight when needed, worked 14 hours in a single day when needed, and helped with special projects. The management staff there do not seem to care that there is a life outside of work so they keep you as long as they can to make sure work gets done especially when there are issues that other workers have not finished said work and refuses to do what it takes to get the job done as I do. I have not found anything to be the hardest part of the job. but I have found that I enjoy working with customers to assist them in helping find products. I also enjoyed working for the Dairy Department to ensure everything got done. But it doesn't matter when you sacrifice your spare time to help with the business except"
bad,They are not diversity inclusive. They shamelessly suppress the production of store workers for self gratification of bonus pocket payments. They also undermine all safely rules and regulations for the sake of bonus payments. The union enables non-production for self-serving of their pay check via union dues with representation for the unionized employees.
bad,"Having to consistantly look over your shoulder because of coworkers or Management lack of role, it made for a horrible experience.  I made several coworkers but met very few friends."
bad,There is not enough staff to help out and not enough hours in the day to get the job done right. As hard as I work it is never good enough nor done correctly
bad,"Safeway was my first job. I started from the bottom as a courtesy clerk straight out of high school and worked my way up. When I was hired, the company used to stand behind you and generally took care of its employees. It's not like that anymore. Ever since the merge with Albertsons, the company has been sinking lower and lower. They expect you to work harder with less hours and constantly tell you that you're not doing a good enough job. I wish I were exaggerating. And cooperate backstage adds more workload than any one person can handle. Ever since I moved to Oregon, I have had terrible managers who do not take care of problem employees and do not help you when it is needed. I even had a manager tell everyone that he hated his store and thought we were all worthless!! I might be over stepping my boundaries but I am no longer loyal to a company who has literally killed hundreds of peoples spirits. I have never seen a higher turn over rate. We are always short staffed but there are not enough hours to go around. I went from having 30hrs a week to 24 to 18. And it's not getting any better. Half of the time when we hire people, they walk out on their first week. We rarely ever get people to put in their two week notice. They might pay good, have career advancement, and benefits, not to mention paid vacations but to me, it's not worth it. I've worked for the company for 12years and am topped out in pay and am willing to take a pay cut just to escape the miasma that is Safeway."
bad,It started out well but management plays too many games. It's only a .50$ raise for managers so it's not worth your time to advance. And if you decline a manager position they mess with your schedule
bad,not really worth going career unless you are major corporate behind kisser. The highlights are customers who treat you as a human. Nice discounts and deli food for rewards of whatever they decide.
bad,"The managers at safeway ride your butt for no reason. you get the job done and its not good enough. the raises are terrible unless you stay 5+ years. If you are looking to move up in a company, good luck here."
bad,"Coworkers thrive on drama, they act like this work place is high school. There are always petty fights. Hours are difficult to attain, There is a minimum they have to give you based on your contract, but good luck getting more than that. If you need a day off they will take that out of your minimum required hours."
bad,"Jobs okay for the first 6 months, maybe. Then it's a fast plummet to stress, anxiety, unachievable work expectations, low and unnecessarily inconsistent hours, and dealing with immature self-entitled management that has no clue how to do their job or properly treat their employees."
bad,I use to work here during my high school years and while I was working there I felt like there was a lot of disorganized people there I was in line for a promotion but ended up getting knocked out of it by a lie by an employee
bad,"I just had a hard time with co workers release programs, everyone already worked there for 12 years in their positions and customers calling all checker stupid for their previous history. I was new and I was called stupid by the customers. I held in there and tried to provide customer service in that environment everyday. I had to leave. Too petty to me."
bad,"I started off as a U.C., moved to Deli Team Member and then moved up to Baker in the bakery. Baker was an enormous strain. Too many things to do for one person alone. Prep for the day, prep for the next day, fry tons of doughnuts by hand and also frost them, make dough 150lbs to 250lbs per day and roll out by hand, bake the bread you rolled out, put toppings on items that need them, some goe through machines, bake off many other goods like muffins, cookies, pies, ect. All while keeping up on the timers, deadlines, orders, and customers and cleaning up and i skipped several other responsibilities but that is more than enough to prove my point. Plus, i never got a raise. I still remained at $10.00 an hour. My story of my experience there continues, but i wont go on about it. All and all, i dont recommend working there unless you are going for Cashier or as a Courtesy Clerk."
bad,"The bright side is that when I was accidentally outed as LGBTA in a very conservative area, the corporate policy meant the management couldn't fire me as I wasn't doing anything negative towards my job."
bad,I am currently the Starbucks manager of this location I do hiring for them I also do safety for them and any other task on the slide I do customer service and it's just too much of what I do for my small paid for Starbucks manager position
bad,"Overbearing and stressful to work there. I did learn some valuable management practices and inventory control methods. My coworkers were for the most part good to work with, I still remain friends with many of them. The hardest part of the job was the stress and trying not to take it home. The most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers and working with the public."
bad,"I enjoyed the team work and environment.Co workers had great skills and conducted team worker in a very professional and correct manner.Horrible Management.Non professional Manager and the managers had horrible,un- satisfactory customer service and people skills."
bad,Safeway was one of the best jobs i had but the union was no help to the workers and the management was very rude and never had anything positive to say about your hard work unless it benefited them. Working at Safeway was a huge learning experience for me since i was young and i still learn from that job today. I love working with my customers and employees.
bad,"I have 25 yrs experience in grocery retail,4 yrs in management. When I first started with Safeway it seemed like it would be a great job but the longer I was there it got worse and worse. I graduated from my management class and was about to be front end manager when everything feel apart. I was put on suspension because a girl I work with was involved in some coupon scam and somehow, through association,I was involved. They treated me horribly, was in suspension status for over 6 months and no one would tell me anything. Ended up they said they terminated me the day they put me on suspension. This company is always hiring because they tray employees horribly and fire them oror they quit, so they'e constantly hiring. The managers think they are God and that they can do e whatever they want"
bad,"*Dept. opener, Distress Old product,Stock Bread wall , Paper work, Ordering, Packaging product. Baked ,Frozen Load ."
bad,Has good benefits but job schedule is not consistent. Management can be a lot better.
bad,"Every job has difficulties but when the employer reduces labor to improve the bottom line because of poor decision making from the executice staff, difficulties are magnified and employee morale falls."
bad,"Had to quit my job as a courtesy clerk I  this store because this verbally and mentally abusive manager sent me to the emergency room. Had to quit because the HR is so desperate to keep this woman in no matter how many times employees AND customers complained about her. She has a reputation in the hometown for being a nasty and unpleasant individual. "
bad,"My experience at Safeway was horrible. I was micromanaged and told constantly how much I could’ve done and never felt appreciated. They say “flexible” time off, but it’s per their approval, and it was a fight every time trying to ask for a day off being part-time."
bad,"With the amount of work required and the amount of training given, I was no where near prepared to complete any of that work when expected of me a few days after becoming a cake decorator. All the store manager does is come and point out what we don't have out (that I already know) and waste my time then tell me I should just simultaneously make 5 of something with no regard to how complicated the thing is. It's way too stressful and I can't wait until I can resign, but I just need to get another job first."
bad,"• Responsible for wrapping and weighing meats when necessary to achieve proper conditions in department."
bad,"very petty at the deli in pg plaza location, nasty attitudes, dirty work areas, disrespectful bunch, I would not recommend working there. I did not learn much from this location, however; the deli in the Bowie location was much better."
bad,"It doesn't matter if you've worked at Safeway for 1 week or 10 years. They don't value you at all. Even if you've worked hard, never say no, come in at a drop of a dime, always stay over, etc... They will not stand behind you and they will get rid of you if you're not important enough to them. Or if you dont fall into the right group. The higher ups who come into the stores, dont take the time to actually talk to any employee lower than management. They barely wave hello or introduce themselves. It makes you feel insignificant in a company who boast the importance of their employees. I would like to see them do the job that they want us or their managers to do with the restrictions that they give them."
bad,"constant negative attitude from all employees and managers that creates a depressing atmosphere. No wage increases, and a constant habit of trying to give more work without compensation. Learned how to work under pressure and how to communicate with customers and coworkers to resolve problems with very little support from coworkers/managers."
bad,I had a fun time working there and it set me good while I was in school. The managers are cool and it isn’t an overwhelming job to where work stresses you out.
bad,"Hmm, I don't know where to start. Poor management, stressful environment, hectic hours, don't care whether you parttime or not, you work till you drop, no respect for employees, one person works for three shifts, on and on and on"
bad,I wouldn’t prefer anyone to work there it’s not worth the pay. I say that because they work you hard hours and you’re not receiving the pay you deserve it’s better finding something that’s going to benefit you in the long run.
bad,"Management did not seem to care this was 8 + years ago. Inefficient in there planning, poor scheduling. Low stress and good benefits. Would work there again if management was better."
bad,You have to work 16 hours minimum which was a lot for me. Pay is minimum wage and you have to join a union to be able to work there. I was a courtesy clerk so I did sweeps and carts and bagging. Maybe if I was a cashier it would be more fun. The manager and assistant manager never coordinated so they had you do different things and the other got mad at you for not doing something else. Supervisors were nice and so were others.
bad,"ordering,stocking,facing,inventory."
bad,"I absolutely loved working here at first but then...."
bad,"fast paced "
bad,safeway is not to for everyone and it wasn't for me one thing I did like was my job title was grate I gave my all in my work .but I just didn't like the management they didn't play far
bad,"A great fast paced environment where I could work collaboratively or independently depending on the time of day. The management in my department was phenomenal, but the store management is terrible."
bad,Decent company no room for advancement employees are always calling in sick or wanting to leave early which slows down the whole work process for management
bad,"Safeway over works its employees and does not compensate them to keep up with the cost of living. This companys favorite trick is to promote an individual, then delay their increase compensation for the promotion. They will state they do not pay or offer back pay."
bad,i loved the alamo safeway even though everone is all over the place but people their was nice butt lake mertt people their has one heck of a scew lose. to many robberys and some people their get trigggered for no reason its just dumb.
bad,just love workin at safeway the team was good and we all work together and help each other out when need help just love just love my safeway team work team work team work
bad,"Working at Safeway has been rewarding.  A typical day at this job is not very typical at all.  Each day is different, as we work with so many different customers, with special requests and concerns about our products.  I work with each customer directly at the front end, assisting with their purchases with respect and courtesy."
bad,"Working there, the customers were friendly and the employees were cool. But some of the members of management need more training."
bad,work load is bigger for the hours provided to complete tasks. loved what I did but stressed out on trying to get everything done. Management needs a different mind set other than trying to save money. Customers should always be top priority.
bad,"Terrible management, when you're on training they aren't clear they just leave you on your own to figure it out, short staff ALWAYS, mis treated by co-workers and you won't get the hours that you're guaranteed to get."
bad,Can make good money if you are full time and have seniority. Besides that the work culture is toxic and management doesn't care and is weak. Avoid if you enjoy positive work environmnets
bad,I hadn’t the slightest clue what was in store!! I was hired the same day I turned my application in and was told I was a great fit for the position. Come to find out anybody was a great fit at that time because they were in dire need of HELP!! So the position required you to do your job and the next persons because they’d hire anything breathing instead of qualified persons! Don’t bother applying unless your willing to give up your soul!
bad,"Glad I left when I did. It was good at first but got too hectic and it seemed like my boss stopped caring after a while. The pay was terrible, not worth the stress and the discount was a joke."
bad,"Get ready to be harassed by customers everyday. The job itself is very fast paced and stressful. I was a cashier and didn't get enough training so I was blamed by customers."
bad,You get yelled at for asking questions and they expect you to know everything by just being showed it once. I’ve never felt so disrespected by a company in my life. Overall if I could I wouldn’t even work here ever again. I got fired for “not getting it” even though I only got 4 days of actual training.
bad,"Good benefits but albersons and Safeway merged this caused all form of confusion. Lack of communication, many changes, cutting back hours. Which caused alot of hostilities. Refusing to work with the unions didn't help. This has many employees as well as customers unhappy."
bad,"Typical day at work looks good if the bathroom toilets aren't malfunctioning, collecting carts is usually  a hassle because your expected to bring in all the carts by yourself if no one else is scheduled the same time as you. No one else cares about their job in the slightest, the store didn't have self checkout for at least a year, putting stress on the already limited number of cashiers."
bad,"No real training when you start. Bakery manager is a miserable, mean woman! Store manager yells and threatens to fire you in front of customers. Not a pleasant place to work."
bad,"Preforming Payroll function like running People soft software queries to pay vacation, sick PTO, etc. to all the Safeway employee's. Troubleshooting emails and phone calls regarding disputes with their pay check."
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. The managment is offel. The managers their were nosy and did not do their job. Their was lack of team work, I was working alone while the line was always full. No help was given."
bad,They don't train their employees properly. They expected me to do the work of three different people. I was promised a promotion that was never given. The hours were not good and I only got full time hours when their were on holidays. No benefits. I was treated poorly and still in  one year didn't miss a shift. I had no choice for my own mental health too leave there.
bad,"I've worked as a Bakery Clerk in Safeway and enjoyed working in the Bakery department. but the way the management is handled there is really unprofessional. Management needs to improve on communication, professionalism, and proper treatment for new and current employees that work there."
bad,They hired people on the summer & they laid them off after August 8 if what they decide on mandatory meeting that's sad... How nice to work for? Use and abuse you on the summer after they promised you before you start working with them  it will be more clients when the school starts.  Safeway are terrible comes with promising ! They are totally Sucks...  Everyone watch out! Whoever wants to Apply ???
bad,"A typical day at work usually includes coming in and serving customers within deli department. Cutting foods for salads, cleaning and maintaining a safe work environment."
bad,"When you leave a grocery store you tend to miss the coworkers more than the customers. I do not miss the stress or the problems associated with the store, I do miss my coworkers though."
bad,the managment at safeway was questionable but i apreciated the cash and everything i learned from customer service and from the assosiations i made
bad,"My typical day at work was like an average work place, i leaned how to bag groceries in a more sanitary way. My manager was a very nice man and im glad i can say i met him along the way. My co-workers were not always the most plesant people but everybody has their problems. The hardest part of my job was working thirds and not having any security, we gotg robbed while i was on the job a man put a gun to my face, and still my mananger told me he will never hire security, after awhile it kept happening and i had to put in my 2 weeks notice. Overall because of the security reasoning and lack of communication i rate this job a 3 out of 10."
bad,can be very stressful sometimes but great pay and co workers. they also have a great medical plan for employes
bad,"A typical day at work would begin with returning items back to the shelf, a heavy amount of janitorial duties due to slacking co-workers. The compensation is poor, and the advancement is less than that, the management needs to be replaced. and the ""Union"" doesn't protect violated employees."
bad,"Receiving local vendors and checking in local product to keep up with store inventory. Unloading 40ft containers of dry and frozen food coming in from the mainland. Operating a pallet jack and fork lift. Customer assistence, answering phone calls, scheduling maintanence through out the store. Keeping warehouse neat and clean. Running daily reports on inventory, accounts receivable. Management was strict but knowledgable and very helpful. There was no hard part, I enjoyed my time there and made some really great friends that I still keep in touch with."
bad,A lot of mind games at Safeway. They work you very hard & expect more & more out of you. A lot of customers treat you very badly & management rarely has your back
bad,I worked at Safeway for a year as a GM stocker. I recieved one 10 cent raise throughout my employment despite going out of my way to learn and complete tasks that weren't in my job description. Raises are NOT based on merit. Instead you get an extra 10 cents every 1000 hours worked. Which for a part time employee would mean a raise every 50 weeks or so. Essential giving you nothing at all for the entire year
bad,Managment was poor I began seeing more and more co-workers leave the job. Many others left the job as soon as they got in. The managment was overall poor always messing up my schedule. I provided them with my school schedule and they would schedule me poorly and blame me for always needing to fix my schedule even though I had talked to them many times about my availability
bad,"poor team work"
bad,do not work here. The hiring staff is horrendous. They will give you short hours with very low wages. I had to resign due to the managers  disrespectful attitude. I would not recommend working at the king farm safeway.
bad,Does not value workers as people. Consistently does not hold other employees accountable and makes other employees fill in at a moments notice. Disrespectful to workers in general.
bad,Managers treat the employees horrible It’s a s*** show everyday! The managers and Gm need to be replaced if Safeway wants to see improvements. High turn over of employees because no one wants to work with the current managers !
bad,They treat their employees like a number an their just not nice at all don't care if you have kids either an any emergencies that come up as well they don't care
bad,I enjoyed the customers and working with the coworkers. Fun place to work. The hours worked perfectly as a part time job around my full time position.
bad,"I work part time as a cashier at Safeway, I’m a new hire since so many people quit. They gave me a total of 30 hours in 3 days, with barely any training. I have no time for a personal life anymore since I do things on the weekends since they require you to work weekends. It’s not fair to give someone 30 hours in 3 days of working with barely any experience."
bad,Literally the worst job ever. They tell you to hide things from corporate and that they will back you up if corporate finds it. They dont and corporate does find it. If you do it the way corporate wants it your manager will complain that you dont have the time to do it that way and try to discipline you for doing things thr proper way. Who knows new manager now but I have seen 2 store managers and 3 assistants and no luck changing so good luck with the job.
bad,worked there a total of 6 years and never once got a raise even after asking 30000 times you get told yes and its a promise you will never see I moved up to assistant manager was promised a raised to 15 an hour did it for a year and never saw that raise
bad,You are just a number got let go after 18 years for being 5 min short for the week on their standards. When you start you will most likely be working nights and weekends no family life.
bad,"I was the lowest of the low, having to count gross tobacco chew bottles and clean the bottle counting machines. It wasn't that great of a job. I felt like low level staff and was treated as such"
bad,"Management is always coming up with added work to be done and doesn't supply enough people to actually get the job done. The staff doesn't work as a team. All the work and the mess of four or five people is left for the single closing person. The pay is low and they would hire more PT employees instead of making more full time positions. The upper store management was always"
bad,"Terrible place to work. Low pay, virtually no benefits if you're hired as part time and, that's virtually everyone.  I observed half the workers stood around, and the other half were forced to work at a feverish pace to support those not doing anything. If you took a sick day off, to get paid you had to get a doctor's note indicating you are sick.  So in essence you had to pay to see doctor to get sick pay.  You are forced to join a useless union that basically just backs the store. The company insures itself so it's policy is not to stop thieves.  People come in and just take whatever they want.  The company refers to it as shrinkage. So to make up for the loss they ""Steal"" or keep the employees at bottom rate pay.  A lot of the buddy buddy mentality. If a customer wants a free cup of water, they can have it.  If an employee takes a paper cup for water without paying for it-they are fired."
bad,When I first started out I was happy and then the further I got in my happy went to stressful real quick I had 30 hours a week when I started and now I don't not getting along with other employees can't stand them when they think there the boss of me if your not the boss of me just shut up and focus on your job not mine honestly how hard is it to just leave someone alone
bad,"My low ratings for Safeway was due to my last manager who was just completely disrespectful, inconsiderate and uncaring. Needless to say, he was let go shortly after I moved. I worked for Safeway years before and it was a whole different outlook. Great management and staffing."
bad,"they would give you low hours to work, work you like a dog and expect you to work late nights and turn around and come back in the morning. Pay is horrible for the amount of stress you have to indure"
bad,"By far, one of the worst places I have worked. The customer service desk was always busy, and no one there to help customers. Courtesy’s get stuck with monkey work. Ridiculously understaffed. No one wants to honor your requested time off, nor honor sick days without yelling at you. They do everything in their power to avoid workers comp responsibilities. I called in because I was in the emergency room and was told I should have thought of that before getting sick. You are yelled at for everything. Breaks were almost nonexistent. Maybe one towards the last hour of your shift. Ridiculously underpaid and compensated."
bad,The management there is very dysfunctional there and very rude. They don't contact you through text nor email or call you about your schedule? But I highly recommend you look somewhere else.
bad,"Poor management, management will scream at you in front of customers. Very poor customer service. Nobody has any accountability or sense of loyalty. employees shop at competitive stores instead of their own."
bad,"Great pay but very demanding, the district manager was terrible and ultimately decided to leave because of him. Has bad people skills and works you to the bone with no appreciation."
bad,"Every time I came in I never knew what I would be doing. I was either getting carts, stocking frozen, stocking dairy, and I was even stocking produce."
bad,"I prefer not to discuss the very negative work environment at Safeway. Honestly, it varies greatly depending on which location and what job title you are working."
bad,Safeway as a company does not seem interested in providing a good experience for its customers or its employees. The work place is stressful and lacks organization.
bad,It has great benefits but it takes a while to advance in that place of work. The job its very physical. Sometimes its very long working hours. Very friendly staff on the other hand.
bad,"Poor management, poor pay. I was continuously given more and more responsibility in my department, enticed by offers of pay increases and none were ever given to me. Fellow employees who were unprofessional and down-right rude to customers and who did not ever do their job all the way, much less well, were never reprimanded and continued to somehow be awarded more work hours than employees who performed well and were professional and courteous."
bad,Raises were okay and management was okay too just a little picky with who was cool and who was inconsiderate. Good place for high school students needing ectra cash. Not a career place.
bad,"The more seasoned employees trash talking other Supervisors. Lots of whispering. It is paid training, but they do not teach you much of what you will actually need to know to be on the floor. Not once did I feel valued."
bad,"Safeway was not exactly a very good experience, many of the customers were either mean or could not be satisfied, the management was very strict, and only a few coworkers were friendly"
bad,Minimum wage for a cashier is very very low..... Not to mention this place was very friendly staff and great customers just unfair pay for job requirements
bad,The managers did not look out for their employees. They threw you into the job without any proper training and expected you to hold up your position to the best expectations when you yourself are trying to figure out how things are done because of lack of training.
bad,the environment at Safeway was kind of stressful most days and lot of the time the employees did not get a long. if something wasn't able to get done other would be harsh towards certain employees or management
bad,"I was trained poorly by the staff and management, there was always a pressure to get things done - and my training was often rushed. I did not like the fact that, knowing I was new, they had consistently put me on evenings/closing when no one was around and service was slow - and then had the audacity to complain I wasn't ""doing my job"". There is no real benefits and the wage was poor. "
bad,"It seemed to be a broken department, that had three people who are willing to sacrifice everything to meet political standards, and on the other hand. There was the other half,  that strategically took advantage of the company, and hard work of others.  I guess that  could be found in any department, or job you find any were. That's never stopped me from being an over achiever.  In some cases it ment, the 12hr effort in an 8hr day only panned out to be 8hrs of work to show for."
bad,"It was pleasant to work with costumers,really like my job as a cake decorator,the company benefots wre really good and thr co-workers really helpful working as a team, really like this job , but it was time to move forward and look for better opportunities."
bad,I was a very punctual and hard working employee and the company was not accommodating to any life situations emergencies that happened to arise. I have never had an issue with an employer before and I hate to talk bad of anyone but I would never recommend working for this company.
bad,not the best place to be working at because of the politics and if anything happens you usually are on your own the only real upside is the union because you have a chance to make things right if you get wronged
bad,It's An OK Job To Have The Pay Isn't Much And You Don't Get A Lot Of Hours If You Are New To The Company. I Feel. It's  A Great Starter Job For Youth Or Someone Who Is Trying To Get Back Out In To The World Of Employment. But Any Job Is Truly A Blessing!!!
bad,"I really don't know what to say! The management is truly horrible from the top to bottom. The store manager feeds his customers lip service; while behind the scenes he treats his employees like liquid trash. Not to mention the constant belittling of employees in front of customers right in the open store. Oh, and did I mention the lighting in the store gives off the vibes of a dungeon. All in all the job was stressful and not worth the time."
bad,"The company was great, always there to answer questions and takes thing seriously if there is an issue that needs to taken care of inside the actual store."
bad,"There is no chance to work for this company, specially when is running by people from India or Pakistan they only hire people from their country.  Specially Saddle Ridge Location at Calgary AB."
bad,The place feels almost corrupted. Those with seniority run the company. Understandable until they start treating those that haven't worked that long like slaves.
bad,"Cashier jobs are very stressful, working with the public is not for me. Staff is very confrontational. but good for young students to work if its a summer job and not a serious."
bad,"I met a few good people.  I learned a lot about myself and about retail.  It is time to experience something new now."
bad,"Unhealthy place to work, not taking care of the staff, lack of planning to improve the sale."
bad,The manager was very vague when training and I felt that I didn't get the necessary training that I needed. I was often called in due to irresponsible employees that wouldn't show up for their shift and felt isolated due to the location of the fuel station from the store.
bad,"Horrible place to work"
bad,The bosses where very unforgiving and would harrass you if you didn't finish a very hard job in a decent amount of time. The day was long and didn't ever end on a good note.
bad,"A typical day is more work than can be done in two days. No accommodation or help from management, considering they are the ones who make all the problems. (ie hiding in the office) Constance anger customers."
bad,greeting customers in a courteous manner. taking orders in person or over the telephone. Serving customers at all time even in a intense situation. I have learned how to become an quick leaner. I learned how to work cooperatively with a wide range of personalities. I have leadership skills and training for instructing new employees in procedures and techniques.Get alone well with employers and co-workers. teamwork to get the job done.Their wasn't any hard tasks that i couldnt accomplish. The most enjoyable moments were the customers delightful attitudes.
bad,Its just not a fun place or environment. The pay is not worth all the work your doing .
bad,"management was awful."
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,Assist customers by ringing up their purchases and to make the drinks from Starbucks when ordered by customers. The hardest part was the rude and irate customers and the style of managing.
bad,"My first thoughts of Von's were good, however those thoughts quickly turned sour as I began to notice that this company resorted to micromanagement and propaganda. During my employment they had a television in the employee lounge with nothing but Safeway stock charts, their television advertisements and the company CEO telling what he expected of workers continuously. Near the end I was told that I was to take a pay cut in the position that I had worked over a year to get into, workers were told that they were not allowed to drink water on the clock, and eventually it came to a day that I was unable to make it to work, and they told me to either ""get there or find another job"" (which I had already secured). The unusual thing was that when I spoke to some of the other employees, they were told that I had ""quit"". So the ambiguous nature of my separation with this company was just as ludicrous as my time in their employ. I have since checked up with some of the employees that still work there, and have been told that treatment there has grown to be even worse. I have nothing good to say about this company at all."
bad,"Fast paced, team work, very diverse, union. Most decisions are based on seniority."
bad,Fired with no notice beforehand on how they would prefer for me to do something. I could have easily fixed it if someone told me that they would prefer me to do something the other way but there was no notice. They mentioned a physical characteristic as the other reason for firing me. I should sue them just for that. Coworkers who were obnoxious but did no actual work and left it all for me were rewarded. There were some nice coworkers but management was filled with awful people. If you get a job here don't expect them to give you a good reason for firing you out of nowhere after you've been told multiple times by other people that you are really good at you job. Don't apply here.
bad,"The customers are wonderful. Co-workers were great, helpful, and fun to be around."
bad,"Packaging goods, Stocking and dating items. Customer service was a large factor."
bad,It's a big company and employees are just numbers dont care about the people just want work out of them what they need are robots most fellow employees are great management was good for most part union just takes your money
bad,Its was alright didnt like my manager but overall my co works were awesome tought me new things i never knew about it was fast paces but easy never overwhelming
bad,"i started working at SafeWay distribution center in July 1/2015 to May 30/2018 until they fired me it was very disappointing to me they never gave me a chance ,before they put me in a colder department i was doing ok"
bad,"I started working for Safeway in 1964.  In 1993, the Willows Safeway closed its doors and all employees were without a job.  I felt this company had little regard for its loyal employees."
bad,"My job duties to disassemble and assemble parts after clean and sanitize these parts and every day you have different schedule according to the production and you learn how to set-up the machines and you will use chemicals. I was working night shift, the job is great but you make sure everything is clean and sanitize and you have on time before the production works coming."
bad,I served on tray line twice a day Worked in dish room did different duties  picked up trash took it out. Made late trays took to patients cleaned up tray line after meals made coffee for the next meal.
bad,Super high stress place to work. I was in the deli and it was incredibly bad for my mental health. It was the only job I worked where it was that much of a struggle to go to work. It was a toxic environment and they didn't deal with work place issues aside from telling us to deal with it ourselves. Management used nepotism for their friends and family. Honestly haven't been as stressed as I was working here. Paid barely minimum wage to deal with mean co-workers and useless managers.
bad,What made this job fun were the friends you got to make if you are lucky. It's definitely not the worst job or hardest job but you need to be attentive at all times
bad,"the work space was very fast paced, but i just didn't get the opportunity to advance in payment as much as i would like to, but they will let you learn as much as your willing to work."
bad,"Broken venting equipment led to ppl being sick from cooking equipment "
bad,"I was often asked to work overtime with no warning and guilted into doing so. The hours were awful, the store was dirty, and the managers were all very rude. Definitely more interested in money than they are in the employees."
bad,"VERY LOW PAY! They lie constantly to get you in the door. I was told benefits were available after 90 days. NOPE! 1 year. I had to work for a manager that had every weekend, holiday off. She would not cover for me when I needed to call in because my home flooded from broken pipes. MAJOR FAVORTISM, and bullying. I saw many people bully one specific employee. Then I transferred stores and was told nothing would change, everything changed!!! I lost my pay, sick days and vacation. DON'T WORK HERE!"
bad,I couldn't even leave for the day when a friend died. I had to cry in front of customers the last 3 hours. They kept me 3 hours under being able to get insurance the whole time.
bad,"Safeway does not care about their employees. They step on your throat just enough so that you can breathe. A typical day in the meat department. You would have 12 hours of work with 8 hours to use. We would never have enough people to properly maintain the case. You can look at it this way. Look at the lines at the registers. They never have enough people working the registers because Safeway wants to cut the cost. Yet the employees get rebuked for having lines. You never leave Safeway with a ""Good Job"" from your store manager. It was the single most miserable job I have worked."
bad,"High stress with low reward. Doe's not work well without a flexible life. A very thankless and unfulfilling job, so much to a degree of affecting mental health. Meeting people can be fun."
bad,"The store manager would rather have male managers, would only back a male manager when issues arise, coworkers would rather talk bad about each other then help each other out."
bad,"Was required to do management task and training"
bad,"manager was sucked, coworkers were rude, no proper training, lots of robbery.no free drinks for employees.it is the worse job I've ever had and unfortunately the first."
bad,"• A typical day at work would be somewhat chaotic. "
bad,"I was not fond of working at Safeway at all! The employees were rude and disrespectful. They don't care about anyone. Even in the summer, the store was dim and depressing."
bad,"Lack of communication between management and employees"
bad,"Manager takes out her stress on deli employees and schedule is haphazard at best.  If we call her out on her unprofessional behavior, she retaliates by rearranging our schedules or gossiping to other people behind our backs."
bad,"One of the worst places I've ever worked at. Pay is bad and management is even worse. They expect you to bow down and kiss their feet all the time. Dont make personal plans because you will be expected to work. Not allowed to ask for days off because you will not be accepted. Do not ask for vacation because thats not allowed. If you work at Safeway, that'll be your life for now on. No more personal life. Always work."
bad,It was annoying to work there. Management sat in the office on their phones all day and yelled at all the workers who didn’t seem like they were doing something 24/7
bad,Safeway would be a good job for a young college kid. But I feel that they will promote younger kids just to try and lock them into being at the company for their entire working life.
bad,"They gave me a chance and I was thankful, especially for my first job. But they pushed you to do too much fun your 8 hours and discouraged overtime. It was beyond what they should of asked."
bad,"It's Safeway. What are you expecting? Great pay? Great Benefits? Full Time positions? "
bad,the management was terrible- rude and lazy. made the employees pick up on their slack. The hardest part of the job was closing the store at 11:30 and having to finish homework by 12am and I would fail my assignments because the managers would not work with me on my schedule. I was a full- time student who was an athlete also and they were terrible with that.
bad,"The particular safeway in which i was employed had horrible management, terrible hours and no room for advancement. I personally would not reccomend applying here."
bad,all the managers do is sit around and bs and treat you like you dont matter and that their job is 10x more important. they are selfish and rude. i will never work for safeway ever again.
bad,"manager didn't offer much training or guidance. during lunch time received no help, they have unrealistic productivity goals for employees. Work scheduled wouldn't be organized or posted on time"
bad,"This was my summer job right out of high school. It was a good job for just earning some extra cash. Very easy, and not a hard process getting hired at all."
bad,Loved the work hated the people. Treated the employees like slaves. Threatened your job if you had to call in sick or needed a day off for anything. No job security at all
bad,"They, like most companies have strayed from the ideals they were founded on, now with more inclination to satisfy shareholders than the well being of their employees, you'll find me looking elsewhere and not looking back"
bad,Will never work for this company again management sucks they don't care about the well being or health of employees some employees get time and a half for holidays some don't they will have you working a department by yourself self when the work load is enough for 3 people and won't allow overtime so they expect you to work off the clock
bad,"Very Unorganized, Horrible Management, Not Good Enough Worker, Slow Workers, Racist Managers, Discrimination, Never Learned Anything Felt As Though I Was the only worker, No team work in the work place, Nobody doing they job"
bad,"Was a Warehouse Supervisor. The pay is decent, but the operation all over Vons is somewhat new. There are numerous problems that arise everyday and the job became a problem solving job instead of a job where you can lead people."
bad,It is a good job if you do not want to have a life. They boast being flexible with hours on their website but do not offer flexible hours. Coworkers are friendly but that is about it.
bad,"the safeway that I had worked for was actually one of the lowest rated ones in the state, not the bottom but not close enough to the top. the floor manager tried too hard to push people to take the survey when you could clearly see how tired the customer was of hearing it."
bad,"I did not like this job, they did not train me the right way. They are so unprofessional. They did not let me take breaks or go to the bathroom."
bad,"Too much work for 1-2 people to clean/close entire kitchen in time allotted. Scheduling manager was very unskilled. Never enough help. People always calling in sick, unhappy employees all around."
bad,The Assistant manager is a megalomaniac. Lack of training and knowledge of merchandise. Dealing with lethargic coworkers.
bad,"Day began with face to face communication with management and set department goals. Learned to be strategic and recognized team members strengths and weaknesses and assigned with best outcome. Hardest part was noncompliant staff, so I learned to strategically change the assignments according to psychological ability of staff at certain points. I did enjoyed the outcome of obtainable goals such as increased productivity and high morale in department staff."
bad,"I was offer to diffrenet position and was told that i was the one who they wanted . Turn out they gave it to someone else and then ask me to train the for the postion . Also the management do even care if you are a signle parent the will still scheulde you to a late shift and give the young kids or lazy worker the good shedule and more hours,."
bad,"It could be produtive and fun, but they do not give raises to 90% of their employees. They tell us we can advance, yet it is hard to advance if not given the opportunity. They just tell us what we want to hear. I should never have started work there. A typical day at work consist of stocking, cleaning after day crew is gone. I get along great with produce manager and assistant manger. Don't get much chance to communicate with store manager. Hardest part of my job there is not getting paid enough. I enjoy talking to and helping out customers."
bad,"After putting 8 years into safeway doing overnight work, they needed to cut hours so I got fired because I wasn't part of the ""clique"" that runs the store like a soap opera. The union they have is worthless as I got fired for something I didn't do. Do not work here. Overnight is tough enough. But working with these managers made me never go back to retail"
bad,I would not recommend this place to anyone! The management was horrible the hours were bad and they liked to change the schedule on your days off.. I was also falsely accused of a no call no show because a manager read the schedule wrong and I had to drive to the store and show him the actual schedule. He gave me a smug apology..
bad,a typical day at work was just running 4 different machines and doing other coworkers work. i learned how to run and operate 4 machines. management was unprofessional. my coworkers were people who were rude and unprofessional and were not good with teamwork. the hardest part of the job was the scheduling. it would change like everyday and we were treated like slaves. i didnt enjoy it at all.
bad,"I was a courtesy clerk at Safeway. I bagged the groceries, greeted customers, offered them carry out and restocked the registers. But there were many days when I would go without taking a break at all. Most of the other courtesy clerks were slacking off. They would disappear for moments at a time and I would be left up front by myself. When it would be time to take my break, my manager would tell me to wait. And often times I  would be waiting a very long time. When no one returned to the front I would miss out on my break because there was no one to take over for me. The other courtesy clerks would be made to do jobs in the back room that were not in their job description. Plus the breaks were only 10 minutes long. "
bad,"Long, late, non-consistent hours. No flexibility unless you've been there a long time. Learned scheduling and effective time management. Hardest part was standing for long periods of time and low pay. Enjoyed the customers as well as head-lining projects"
bad,"if you are a minute early or late punching you are reprimanded."
bad,"I disliked my manager.  He would come and single me out if anything went wrong.  I would see other people doing the same thing I did, but I was the one yelled at."
bad,"A typical work day Greet everyone clock in go to my cash register. Greet the customers ring up items start a conversation ask did they find everything they needed if not I would call to a courtesy clerk"
bad,"     Maintaining equipment for safe and sanitary requirements per laws"
bad,"A typical day at work was stressful, they give you little room to learn. My entire time working there they were paying me incorrectly. The hardest part of my job was communtication with my supervisors they never knew how to do their job. I loved the customers and community."
bad,"manager was selfish and had no people skills, lots of gossip, union made any hope of a good job burn and die. They were terrible to work with and I will NEVER work for safeway again. I still have nightmares."
bad,I liked the job until the managers threw their weight around the wrong way. that's where the environment became uncomfortable.
bad,"I was originally hired to work the graveyard shift from 11:00PM to 7:00AM 5 days a week. After 1 week, I was informed that the shift .would changing to 1:00AM to 7:00AM with the same production and duties to be completed in that. time frame. Additionally, my scheduled days would vary from 2 days a week to 5 days a week, .those being 6 hour days. The department had no manager for the entire first month I, was there.Finally a manager assigned who had no bakery experience. She worked very diligently to master the skills and knowledge needed to gain control of the department and make it run smoothly. During that second month things became even more out of control and caused much discourse among the department workers. The hardest part of the job was the reduction in everyone's hours but expecting them to achieve the same level of production, quality and sanitary expectations. My co-workers did the best they could but were extremely frustrated that they were unable to complete all the work needed to support the success of the department. What I enjoyed most about the job, was the cohesiveness and friendliness of my co-workers despite the working conditions. I also enjoyed that I worked my duties very independently and the challenge of finding creative ways to improve the efficiency of the processes of my duties, and producing high quality deliverables under very tight time frames."
bad,"Used to be a great company to work for but thinks change for the worst after the sold the company,only a hand full of people have the change to advance ( friends of the family )"
bad,"This was one of the worst experiences I have had with a job. The organization overall was very poor. The cleanliness of the deli kitchen was aweful! I slipped on the floors cause the grease was so bad. There was old food on the slicers, in the vents on the deli case, and on the floor from the night before. I witnessed employees helping themselves to food, which is wrong. Breaks were not given through out the shift, you might get one 15 minute break. I was put to work on the floor without proper training and this to me is unethical. We are serving the public and all safety measures should be taken. This may stop me from purchasing food from a deli ever again. I wish the experience would have been more positive, but it was not."
bad,"Believed there would be adequate pay to survive and room for advancement, as I was informed. Worked ten months and qualified for health benefits, but could not afford the co-pay on minimum wage. Had to work at the register and be fully trained as a cashier in the Deli without being paid as such (and the difference was significant), several employees refused to ring anything up because of this, which often left me working the registers alone in addition to my duties there. Inappropriate conduct often."
bad,When I worked there I was constantly berated and belittled by the management for wanting to join the military. When I went to join they constantly told me that I wouldn't make it. I called HR who did absolutely nothing about it.
bad,"good starting company, if you want to move up will help you grow in your career if safeway is what you want, very flexible hours and shifts if youre restricted."
bad,"The store manager did a terrible job at creating a healthy team environment. She was not encouraging but instead put people down when her day wasn’t going  well and it rubbed off on everyone in the store. Nobody liked being there, most of the responsibilities were put on the lowest paid staff. It was very negative. I’d rather be broke than work at Safeway again."
bad,"Night crew was treated like they didn't matter, overworked & underpaid. Union was the only positive benefit. Moral was eroded due to lackluster ""management"", if you did the position you where hired for and excelled they would pigeon hole you & ask for more "" teamwork"" to cover lazy, semiretarded coworkers."
bad,"Safeway culture at the stores I have visited and worked at is kind of like a chronic state of depression. Everyone is getting paid the bare minimum regardless of their skill and ability. Those that go above and beyond normally end up just doing more work while those just barely scraping by receive little to no consequence. Since the job also has a high turn around it is very likely to have to work shifts understaffed and/or with untrained co workers."
bad,"Bad pay, terrible hours and no job security. the job I did was not hard, the manager was a moron crybaby and he no longer works there. great first job but not a career I would recommend."
bad,"some of the management (store directors, district management) are inflexible and do not give consistent and complete information and direction to make a job a balance of productivity and positivity."
bad,"This is a good job but only 1 of the management team works with the drivers or personal shoppers.."
bad,No more than 11.75 hourly (Colorado) no benifits besides being union till 3 months of being full time. Management can’t even pull out of dates none the less keep things running smooth.
bad,"Been working there 8 months, now. Started out great, and eventually has become a waste of time. Tried applying for apprenticeship; however, employers didn't care, or take the time to help. I applied for specific position, then unknowingly was placed in another, making a much smaller wage. I worked my whole heart out, into my department and the customers, up until, I lost my motivation. There is no appreciation, or teamwork effort."
bad,"The daily routines were not that bad. The manager always wanted more from me. We were always understaffed, which put more pressure on the clerks. The other clerk was lazy and unproductive. Other department managers and employees seemed very stressed and angry. The safety requests from the department i was in was always overlooked. The hardest part of the job was dealing with all the pressure the manager put exclusively on me, while assisting customers to the best of my ability and cleaning up after the other clerk. The most enjoyable part of the job was when a few other workers and I would let off some steam by talking and taking minor breaks."
bad,"Pay and benefits were horrible here. No raise given for being placed in a higher position. Employees came and went because wage, benefits and hours given to work were all low."
bad,I worked there for about 2 weeks in the deli department. Which they were hurting in BAD. I was fully qualified aswell which made it even better. The Manager there accused me of doing things I did not do. I was also not told that there was a probationary period from the time you got hired so you were not allowed to go home or request time off. At one point I had to leave work to go to the hospital because it was an emergency. A couple days later I get called and they fire me because going to the hospital is no excuse... And because I wasn't in my department all the time....anyway just dont work there. Trash management and increasingly insensitive to your own personal life.
bad,A typical work day at Safeway includes lack of security short breaks to non some of the time. I've learned that my safety and health is more important that getting a pay check. The lack of professionalism gets tiring and frustrated quick. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay busy and occupied when there where very few customers.
bad,It was a stressful environment. I was made the morning manager and dealing with all the money balancing was stressful and hard. Many times money was not were it was supposed to. Work environment was not good
bad,"Safeway used to be one of the better places to work, but things went steep downhill after Albertsons's merger.  Employees are constantly hit with unrealistic goals and metrics with less and less tools to achieve them. Corporate greed, just like any other chains."
bad,"Good place to work in terms of money, holiday pay, etc. but the rotation of employees and management could determine a good day or a bad day. Our store manager was very difficult to communicate with and in my year of employment, and being my first job, there was never a time that the manager took the time to address me by my name. I felt small when I should have been beyond proud of myself."
bad,When I started at Safeway I enjoyed learning about the pharmacy. However as the years progressed it became much more difficult to work with management. There was so many company changes in all positions and mine was phased out.
bad,Corporate was horrible.  Always wanted more productivity but would not pay overtime or provide extra employees to produce the desired quota.  Always wanted good surveys from customers when indeed the service was horrible\.
bad,"You use to be able to advance in the company, but since Safeway switched to Albertsons,  it has all gone down hill. The employees are not happy anymore, stores dont hold the same shine and values, and management definitely has a lot to do with the job."
bad,Worked hard here for two years only to be shot down by new managers. Very tedious every stressful I’d rather drive cars all day. I did most of the supervisors job as well as mine the entire time working there. Being a cashier on top of handeling upset customers.
bad,"The work life balance is off."
bad,"A typical day usually started with clocking in, and talking to the manager about what they wanted to be started first. I learned you can get hired for a position and never get the positon you were hired for, and learned how to work better by myself. Management only looked out for themselves, let people who worked there longer get away with things that newer employees would've got in trouble for doing. Management also cut your hours whenever they felt like you didn't ""deserve them"". Most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers get what they ordered and make sure there's absolutely no mistake with their orders."
bad,The deli manager that I had was a total dink. She would tell me to do three tasks and expect them all to be done right that very second. She wanted them all done at the same time. She never helped customers and always asked someone else to help them even if they were already busy.
bad,"The job in itself was a wonderful job. Working with others and working with the public is a very rewarding job. Unfortunately, this company has issues with being fair to everyone."
bad,Manger was not fair had poor management. As a new employee was not given proper training. They left me to close alone without me having a clue of what I was actually doing and they would complain in the morning about the things that I could not get done because I wasn't sure how to do them. My co-workers were great certain ones at least so when I would work with them I would learn alot more. The location I worked at is now shut down due to poor management and sales.
bad,"work load is a lot for a very busy store with so little help. The closing person is responsible to complete all the remaining packaging, do customer service, breakout breakfast items to be baked in the morning the following day, and clean the department, and repack the donut and bagel case before going home at 8pm"
bad,The overall morale and attitude of the workforce is poor.This is a direct  reflection on the  attitude of the powers that be.The most enjoyable part consist of the customers who take the time to be focused on the transaction at hand
bad,I work in the safeway fuel staion right now with the amount of employees employed at the fuel station.Hours are very scarce right now.The culture of the safeway gas staion i feel like we are so very over worked and uderpaided.
bad,"I was making maybe $50 a week. They were paying me $7.75 as a courtesy clerk. Management didn't give a hoot about us. Struggled to keep busy. When I was working in the deli, they would force me to wash dishes for 4 hours (managers said nobody should get stuck doing dishes for more than an hour) and even when the chemicals began to eat the skin on my hands (couldn't seem to avoid this even with gloves) and I had to go to the doctor, they still attempted to make me do dishes. They would try to make me do duties that were intended for them. If I requested a day off (i.e. for a musical recital for school) they would punish me by giving me undesirable hours. When I asked for less hours, they brought me down to 8 hours a week. This place was awful."
bad,"Unfortunately, being a courtesy clerk at Safeway was not a great job at all. At my particular store, you are treated like garbage, and you are forced to do all of the grunt work nobody else wants to do. I had managers make me do all kinds of jobs that the store manager asked them to do, but they knew they could just ask one of the courtesy clerks to do it for them while they relaxed or did an easier job. Do not work here."
bad,"Being loyal, dependable, hard working and still have unrealistic expectations from management. Also, one never knows when your hours will be cut, It's difficult to live on 24hours a week. This is a great place to work for a bored housewife or student."
bad,Got fired after a few weeks learning how to bag and talk to customers. The manager was very rude because everyone else was gone and she wanted one courtesy clerk to do all the work.
bad,"Providing health care to our customers by processing prescriptions, maintaining inventory goals, and assisting the pharmacists. On a daily basis providing efficiency in the pharmacy while solving problems & creating solutions . I have worked in Pharmacy for 6 years and enjoy all of my customers and being able to help them back to health."
bad,Was not given the shift I was hired for. Constantly moving departments. Not enough hours to support yourself. Management was not understanding of advanced notice of work shifts.
bad,"Corporate functions as one giant bully and could care less about the store and employees. "
bad,Terrible management that does not know how to adapt or motivate their employees. The culture is bad. There are very little opportunities to advance.
bad,Unless you speak Spanish and are of Latin descend you will see a lack of hours and lack of opportunity for growth. Safeway breeds a culture of distain and distrust for anyone not of there own culture.
bad,The best part was meeting new people and becoming like family to some. You get to see them when they are at their worst and get to watch as they get better. Worked with a lot of great people.
bad,Safeway was an okay beginner job in retail that allowed me to make money for the time being. I thought the overall structure of the company made it hard tto move up.
bad,"Great place to start for entry level, non-experienced worker bee's. Unreliable schedule. Unreliable Management. Uncaring HR. Would not suggest for anyone w/family, attending student, or looking for stability. Safeway lacks in every internal department. Does not comply with employee contracts. Has Unexperienced management. Have worked multiple jobs, even a few grocery. This store fails at being able to provide for its employees at every turn, let alone customers."
bad,"Not all stores are the same. The management makes a difference. If management sucks, your screwed. Overworked, underpaid, unappreciated. Store politics were horrible, unnecessary gossip, work was never just work. To keep it simple, dont waste your time."
bad,"A typical work day consisted of early arrival and very physical demanding work. I learned to take orders for inventory and pull inventory from delivery trucks. Management  had very poor social skills and very unorganized. My co-workers were lazy workers, there one minute, next minute nowhere to be found. The hard part of the job was satifying corporate management, which also lacked in social skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was my day off, which was the same day I picked up my paycheck as well."
bad,"Management is friendly but takes advantage of seniority and rarely offer opportunity for advancement. Flexible with hours but they constantly deal with call ins and no shows with little to no consequences, creating an irritating and constant calling in on your days off."
bad,Bad hours.  They don't tell you until after interviewing it's very part time and random hours. Terrible managers who don't care about employees just themselves. I will never work a union job ever again.
bad,Management changes every several months no stabilization.    Hours constantly changes.  Lots of customer complaints.  high turn over.   .
bad,Management is not efficient.  employees are rude and  not trusting.  The hours are terrible.  There is no respect for employees that go above expectations to make a name for themselves.
bad,"Didn't like working at Safeway."
bad,"This work place was never cleaned to a proper standard for food services. "
bad,I liked working for them in the beginning but things went sour. The management needs a lot of work. Communication should be worked on a little.
bad,"The company, over the last few years, has created a very uncomfortable work environment.  Morale is next to nothing.  Unreasonable on-the-job expectations of drivers.  Management refuses to listen to drivers when we express our concerns of recent changes."
bad,It seemed like the courtesy clerk had the most responsibility but least amount of pay.
bad,Poor leadership. Outdated management practices. Outdated compensation structures. No opportunities for growth.
bad,"come in at 4, print tags, separate tags, hang tags, give breaks"
bad,Few co-workers worked hard most were rude to patrons and also weren't willing to make adjustments when necessary.
bad,"I was hired as a wine steward, and trained by an amazing man who knows far more than most sommeliers do. However, when I was transferred over the location I was hired for, I didn't have any of what he did by way of staff to throw the load, or a liquor clerk--it was just me in a very high volume liquor department. None of this was disclosed in the interviewing process. Furthermore, this placed me squarely in the position of having to lift very heavy wine boxes about 7 hours out of an 8 hour day. So, I put in my 2 week notice after tolerating this for almost 3 months. So low and behold management finally got me the staff I needed, after I put in my notice. Due to the fact I had repeatedly requested what every other wine steward had ( aka staff), and they just didn't seem to see the value in honoring my request, I followed through with resigning."
bad,"On average, my day includes dealing with poor scheduling, rude managers, cut hours, and therefore unhappy customers. I enjoy most of my coworkers, but as a cashier, I am pushed to my limit daily. Physically it is straining. Mentally, numbing. More and more tasks and requirements are place upon us, with no room to improve implementation. Management is steadily declining in quality."
bad,"I worked for Safeway for about a month and a half in the bakery and IT WAS TERRIBLE! I was overworked and under paid. They expected way to much out of me for such little hours and training. I would say, NEVER get a job in the bakery at Safeway. The people were nice enough but, it was just to much for one person to do. They let me go because I wasn't working fast enough but I worked as hard as I could to get the ridiculous amount of work done in just 4 hours. I also worked for them as a Courtesy Clerk in Seaside which was a great job. I loved working in that position. So I would say never working the bakery. Other positions might be good though."
bad,A job that I use to pay bills. Monotonous and not very stimulating. I do enjoy interacting with customers and being a team player
bad,"Was good getting the job it was my first job. It helped me learn customer service, helping customers, cleaning and working in a fast pace enviorment. Managment was a little tough, wasent very understanding of any family emergencies or changes in schedule."
bad,"My position was very repetitious, but the work flow was steady. I was able to listen to music at my desk which was enjoyable. Some of my coworkers were easy to get along with and there were a few that were not so great. The work itself was fairly easy, management need to work better with employee's."
bad,They are bad in hours they target the new commers and they are not fair
bad,"If you have been working for a few years and wish to get unemployment to travel or go back to school this is the place to get it. Like many other people I had a bad experience, worked here for less than a month and was let go for no reason. I felt dirty and ashamed, never been fired before. Reviewed the company online and found out this is something they regularly due to keep people from being union. Been working 5 years before Vons and never been unemployed and got about 2 years of unemployment from this job and went back to school and got my AA. Unemployment + grants + Financial aid + some saved money. I was living pretty nice for two years without having to work. There is a reason why you will always see Vons/safeway on indeed they always fire. This place use to be one of the best companies to work for, but since their union strike it has even been in Forbes as 100 worst companies to work for. FYI they have a cap now on raises at some point it stops."
bad,"As a long-time employee, I have had trouble getting what would clearly be given to other long-time employees at a different company. I am not given a work schedule according to my seniority, I am ignored over others who are shown preferential treatment due to age, ethnicity and physical looks, my management team is lacking in communication and gives poor support for customer issues and breaks, which are to be given to employees mandatorily. The company is always trying to find ways to steal employee's benefits. I have worked at many stores and find that for the most part the other employees and management do not care about racism towards African American coworkers/employees. At every store I have worked at, multiple employees/managers have said racial slurs and derogatory words about women. At many stores, I have been treated as a scapegoat, to work long late hours, where when I call for assistance the closing managment does not want to do their job.  As an older person, I'd warn others against taking this job."
bad,"Awful place to work, management hates everyone and gets nothing done. This leads to people who hate their job. However there are a few shining stars who work there and made the whole experience bearable, which is amazing because Safeway really sucked"
bad,I applied for safeway cause I couldn't find away warehouse positions here in trinidad and small story short I didn't like that they placed me in a different position than what I applied for so I left.
bad,Never again will I work with such unprofessional managers and dangerous environment.  Gave the company 2 chances and was let down both times. Good by.
bad,"The job I was doing was in the meat department, I found out after a week there the boss of that department had issues with people that had learning disabilities. Another interesting fact , If your not high enough in there union , you get very little hours . The job can be very difficult and demanding at times."
bad,"(24th and NobHill Safeway) Disorganized upper management favored employees, there was random schedules, overworked w lack of hours (last 3-4 days of work week then the first 3-4 days of beginning of work week) 2-4 days off a week, weekly pay, no overtime, people complained to cashiers about prices"
bad,The reason I would rate a 0 on management portion. They have poor management and only hire people that are their friends or family with no skill whatsoever. The pay is great they're competitive with the Bay area. Overall all of the general warehouse labor employees are easy to get along with and also the Union Representatives. My job interview took long before I got one.
bad,Towson Location Horrible place to work. Management is Mediocre at best and no room for Advancement....Lack of Security.. No incentives for going above and beyond your job
bad,"3 words: Just. Don't. Period."
bad,"This location my experience was not great. I was bullied, store managers were rude. My manager threatened me about reference. Seniority was not followed. Was left alone to fend on my own in the kiosk. Overall was really cruddy."
bad,Really poor communication all around. PIC’s don’t care about anything that happens and management doesn’t care about what happens. Your manager will just schedule you for a full week shift and expect you to do it. If I had a better manager I would stay just for the money but being around people that don’t care and carry so much drama to the store impacts how you feel and work at the store.
bad,You can't call in sick. Management will literally send someone to pick you up so you don't miss a shift if a car breaks down. They are not nice about it either.
bad,"You may get hired for one position but will be asked to perform many other position duties. Like for example I was hired as a Decorator but was constantly asked to do Bakers duties. I am a team player and didn't mind at first. But when I found out Bakers make a lot more and I should have been getting paid Bakers wages. No one told me that and wasn't gonna tell me. I have been with Safeway for a little over a year and have been transferred to 3 different locations. I stayed at the first location for 4mons, second location 10mons, and just started the third location. When you are transferred to a location you are never told until the day before or when the new schedule comes out which is weekly. The pay rate is minimum wage. You have to become a part of the Bakers Union. With the union contract you can never be full time unless you are a manager. Your pay rate only goes up 10cents for every so many hrs you work. I wouldn't recommend working here. If you have a car and don't mind being moving around at will then this is the job for you."
bad,"Crazy because doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result, for a dying company..."
bad,"Spent almost 2 years with safeway, would not recommend to anyone aside from a very short term, stop gap job. Was promoted from entry level courtesy clerk to cashier, never received actual pay increase that was owed after repeatedly asking my payroll person and store manager. Stuck around for a year like that, simply because my direct supervisor and store were good to me overall."
bad,"When hired on two separate occasions with Safeway, I can honestly and wholeheartedly say that you really shouldn't expect to be told much of anything of importance. "
bad,Under staffed with poor management.  I was part of the management team and was helpless to help employees / customers at times from lack of staffing.  They need to work on what customer service really is.
bad,Not a good place to work. The management was not nice to there employees. I always felt I was not part of the team. The pay was not good and I could not afford to pay my bills.
bad,Safeway is an nice environment a very good place to work but some managers are not in control of their situation they do favoritisms their not caring for orhers
bad,"The pay is minimum wage and the hours usually get cut and are inconsistent. It's difficult to ask for time off, but the work/life balance is decent. The culture is super stressful because management is mean."
bad,"Although Safeway is now Albertson/Safeway when I worked there it was only Safeway. Their priorities were back wards, the Directions given were conflicting and did not promote success or confidence in the future. Only results mattered and the constant pressure to get things done with limited hours resulted in the necessity to spend time working without pay to keep from getting fired. It was truly one of the worst retail experiences of my life."
bad,it is a great work place. i just believe their needs to be better management and team work. i enjoy what i do and like the customers. i also like the fact i get paid every week.
bad,I believe our store would be a great place to work if we had a manager who truly cared about his employees. If we had safety from outside harassment and violence.
bad,i liked my fellow department co workers but the head of the operation the main manage meant were very against women and treated us poorly and many did not want to speak up so i left.
bad,"So much drama and management is childish. Customers are incredibly rude and sometimes racist, and managers will allow them to be so. No opportunity for advancement whatsoever"
bad,Not a very fun job. iI had no training and hardly anyone showed me how to do basic job functions. I was forced to learn for myself how to do my job and there wasn't much of a team oriented environment.
bad,i hated every second working here my back ached so much because they cat afford to buy scanning guns so i would have to pick up heavy things the hours were so little it was ridiculous.
bad,"A usual day at the Deli's closing shift included help customers while cooking and cleaning endlessly this is always stressful, but rushing to clean and break down the everything before you incur any overtime is even worse. This job is only for people that are fit or fast food prodigies if no prepare for constant abuse from your manager. The manager gets yelled at so they yell at you and there is no understanding or improvement at the job, training by your actual manager is minimal it's usually done by co-workers who may be doing the work incorrectly.The hardest part of this job is expectations, the most enjoyable part of it is co-workers and fun customers."
bad,"I would stand at a register for hours without a break. Was not allowed water, bathroom breaks without a negative statement coming from workers. "
bad,"The management always schedules employees to work almost full shifts by themselves with no help. One person can't be expected to do carts, clock in sweeps, bag up front and run everywhere to get locked up products all at once. The pay is nowhere near close to standard with the work expected. So many rude customers and co workers who are too involved with cliques and just backstabbing. The head manager is always on vacation, and literally only shows up for 4 hours, if that, a day. There's so many improvements that could be made to this store to help out the employees and the customers as well, but management is too cheap and too stubborn to do anything positive. It gets worse by the days here."
bad,"The job is actually pretty repetitive. If it wasn't graveyard shift, I'd prolly be still working here. I learned so much tho. Like being keen with details, organize and honed my stamina as to constantly moving. The lady manager doesn't give you a chance to work on your own style (she wants you do things on her way) Please hire 3 more people in your department. Hard to tag all the items in all the aisles in each department if there's just 2 people. Have all  work at the same time."
bad,"As a fuel station attendant, I would have to re-stock the kiosk, clean the kiosk, clean the fueling area, stop what you are doing and clean up any fuel spills, count tobacco products at beginning and ending of day, count cash at end of day, count change, etc etc."
bad,While at Safeway I learned how to work fast while be very detailed oriented. Listening and following directions was very important to the workplace organization.
bad,The management now that Albertsons has taken over is  out of control... bullies!! Our hours have been cut almost in half. We have unhappy employees and customers. What was once a great family focused company is nothing more then a corporate black hole. Don’t expect to make any kinda living wage... no hours!!
bad,Unfair treatment by management. They do not treat employees like they are appreciated. Small chance of advancement if any for the employees who work hard.
bad,"Unfortunately my work experience here was far from pleasant."
bad,"I enjoy a fast paced environment, however they have a hard time keeping employees in the deli, making it shorthanded most of the time."
bad,No manager knew what I was suppose to be doing and everyone of them told me different things to do and not to do certain things when another manager was there
bad,"they were THE worst, the managers didnt care about anything except the higher ups getting on their case, the coworkers didnt really care either and would throw you under the bus most of the time without a second thought, and everyone talked behind everyone's back.  i also dont like the ceo, not bad at her job (i think, could very well be wrong, never learned much about her) just rude"
bad,"fun place to work with co/worker's . Timing on cooking,backing,frying,cleaning . Management keep switching,every couple of month's . Not good Leaveing"
bad,"Management was inconsistent with communication and they would show poor manners around the customers.  It was a mess! ! was hired saying that I was guaranteed a minimum of 28 hours weekly but the only way to make the hours count was to work 6-7 days a week.  so they would call me on my days off often and then have attitudes if I couldn't fill in. so I was working 6-7 days sometimes in the five months that I worked there. I've visited other Safeway's and the least on my list it 56th street one in Tacoma,WA.  I was highly disappointed!  But I loved being a F/E Cashier!"
bad,"Management issues, looked down upon for having a family.  I learned I would not like to advance do to management.  Most of the other employees are nice and we all get along but everyone feels the same.  I used to want to move up to show other reviews not all management is bad but that has changed. Good luck to anyone who decides to work here."
bad,Itwas a poorly run and judgment environment to be in. with no understanding from any management and unfortunately for what was thought to be a great first job was in a rude awakening to how disrespectful and inappropriate management and people can be in the working world. not somewhere I would ever want to work again .
bad,I have worked for safeway for 3 years. I feel like there is no proper training for employees or management. Managers are lacking people skills and deal poorly with employees. Thoughts concerns and ideas are often disregarded. They are constantly in survival mode and rarely look at the whole picture. Managers need proper training in management. Skills as well as people management skills. Honestly the only reason I’m still there is the pay.
bad,"poor management, lack of communication. not enough hours for employees, poor time management by upper management. disgruntled employees that work at this particular location. a lot of the employees are leaving due to hour shortages and such."
bad,It is a place to work. They pay you a low wage for high expectations. No managerial loyalty to long term employees. Unwilling to cooperate with a single mother's daycare needs.
bad,"most of the time we were short staffed or improperly scheduled, forced to take on multiple tasks that may be to much for one person to do. management wasnt great help when we were short and sometimes expected improperly trained staff to take on some of the managers responsibility."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of being verbally abused by customers, and on occasion co-workers. Corporate could care less about their employees. The union is a joke."
bad,"Being a courtesy clerk, you had to do pretty much everything for minumum wage. Doing the shopping carts was the worst part of the job since you had to do it outside in the heat. The managers are meh to say the least. Overall, not the greatest place to be working at."
bad,It is difficult at best to accrue PTO and taking the PTO that you do accumulate is next to impossible. You do not know your schedule until 3 days before it goes into effect and it is subject to change from day to day.
bad,I would greet customers with a smile as I bag there groceries. Ask if they would want help out with the groceries. Clean the store with a mop and sweeper.
bad,"it was a good place to get started, not much room for advancement and did not pay very well, you also had to pay union dues which the did not compensate the pay for."
bad,"Pay rate was poor, poor management. The crew was amazing people to work with. I pay rate was too low for the amount of you that you had to accomplish in the given time"
bad,"The overall work environment at this company, store 583, in particular, was extremely poor. There was a severe lack of customer service, and poor management in some departments. they would promise advance and give nothing, even to employees who had been there for years, and were more than deserving of a raise."
bad,"If you want to be underappreciated by both management and customers, look no further than employment with Vons! They want to pay you the bare minimum and give you a ten cent raise every year.   Grocery stores use to take care of their employees and use to have amazing contracts with benefits, those days are long gone. Everyone working here looks visibly exhausted and miserable. Every coworker I had was constantly telling me of their financial struggles. On top of all that, this store is in a ""nicer"" neighborhood which means these pseudo-rich people think they own you and treat workers so disrespectfully. Management took the rich customer's side because they spend a lot of money in the store. Overall a very depressing and frustrating place to work. I became a smoker while working here and quit smoking after I quit this job."
bad,"Company is very strict about breaks. The second your 15/30 minutes are up, they'll be calling for you over the speakers. Allow no room for advancement or raises. Going above and beyond gets you very little if anything, messing up (even if it's minor) gets you a warning and a good slap on the wrist. The work is constant, breaks are given sparingly. If you have an eight hour shift and ask for your 30 minute lunch break, they'll make you stay an extra 30 minutes at the end of your shift. The work is mind-numbing, customers are incredibly rude for no reason way too frequently. The store I worked in was a 24-hour store, which adds a completely new dynamic of awful for the low-level employees, especially since there were no self-checkout lines in the store either, so cashiers were on the clock constantly."
bad,Worked in all types of weather. Took a long time to advance or change pay grades. Go through a lot of employee's. Some employee's been there a long time and did not put forth the effort that was expected from others.
bad,this is one of the worst places I have ever worked. I worked in the deli department for 10 years and the deli manager was constantly talking behind her employees backs. The Management is very inconsistent on how people get treated. There is no attendance policy UNLESS they do not like you. Would not recommend this work place to even my worst enemy!!!!
bad,"Good people, but rude people will accost you because they don't know how the fuel points work and will think you're an idiot and complain to your supervisors."
bad,This particular store always seems to need to cut hours and there is no available job advancement or transfers permitted.
bad,Good stable job. Promotion is limited and there are not leadership classes to help develop employees. Union workers are mostly self served. They are stuck with no progression.
bad,Safeway was just a bad experience. as a courtesy clerk you are treated with such disrespect from all the ever changing managers. i worked there for 2 years and every 4 months we had a new manager it was terrible.
bad,"Easy jobs, low pay. I learned how to enjoy even the angriest of customers. Doesn't give raises based on work, they base it upon hours, then give you limited hours. Co workers were all wonderful. Deli customers were the worst, but just smile its a job and your getting paid for them to throw a fit over things that sometimes don't even involve Safeway."
bad,"Most run down, failing facility I have worked for in my 50 years as a industrial electrician. Very old , low tech environment. Hired as a electrician and not allowed to work on any electrical jobs or breakdowns because they had a bunch of jokers trying to learn the trade. Very unsafe out of code enviroment with nobody to lead the group in the proper procedures to work with moving machines and 480 voltage. No proper LOTO, No arch flash protection. A good place to get hurt or die."
bad,"Safeway was my first job and it was a great first experience. I started from the beginning and worked my way up. I started as a courtesy clerk and then moved up to floral, file maintenance, and bakery. It's hard to move up if you're good at your job. I didn't get promoted until 2 years working there. I was the only person that did the morning duties as a courtesy clerk successfully. It's also really difficult to get hours. I was never guaranteed 40 hours a week. They also tend to take advantage of their employees. After 3 years of working there, I realized that I had to move on and do more with my life."
bad,"It's typically a long day working at Safeway, we're ALWAYS short staff, managers could care less about helping us out when we have long lines of customers. Usually we would have to skip breaks, and take lunches later than we're supposed to. I've actually learned a lot working at safeway these past three years. Patience, communication skills, positive attitude, problem solving ect. I get along with my co-workers perfectly, 9 times out of 10 they listen to me more than our departmetn manager. The most difficult part of the job is working when you have no help and actually keeping calm and being positve en when your own manager doesn't care. Communicating with my fellow employee's and meeting new people is the most enjoyable part of my job by far."
bad,"I worked for Safeway/Vons for about a year as a Barista In my store Starbucks. During that year we switched managers and after we switched managers of my department, I stopped receiving hours, stopped seeing my manager, and was ultimately ignored for the duration of my last 9 months there. I used to get 36-40 hours a week and when we got our new manager she switched me to 20-25 hours a week, less than my contracted 24 hour minimum. When I brought that up to my store managers they simply said to just work for 24 and they would talk to my manager. They never did. Like I mentioned before as well, I only saw my manager about 10 times total. She also at one point made me work a 52 hour week and the two other employees only worked 41 hours. I would be there from the 4:30 AM opening to 1 PM only to be back later for a 5-9:30 PM closing and then a repeat process, doing this hellish shift for seven days straight; against union rules. The other baristas I worked with were generally pleasurable people with the exception of one who would come in hungover and high on the party drug ""Molly"", mind you she and I were both 18 at the time, and she would leave her shifts early because of the instability she created. When I brought this up to my managers they simply shrugged it off and chalked it up to a petty tiff between girls and left it. "
bad,Great first job and introduction to grocery retail. Culture is very polite and accommodating. Stressful most days and hours are very inconsistent
bad,deli department is always busy with customers. deli sandwich bar always have long line which is so hard to keep up with customer demand.
bad,This company's bus system was terrible. Some people quit because of the rule to ride the bus.My foreman was excellent. Management was hard to communicate with.
bad,"was a nice place to work until the great take=-over"
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Safeway, but it became very segregated and difficult towards the end. I do feel that I learned alot about management and will be able to carry those skills on with me to any future jobs."
bad,"Every little thing needed a manager's approval, which would have been fine if there was consistently a manager in the front of the store. Sometimes we had to keep customers waiting for up to 10 minutes because the machines would not let us move forward or even cancel a transaction without a manager's card. 99 times out of 100, they'd just give you the card to move on anyway without even assessing the situation."
bad,I was not impressed with my employer. The middle staff made it very difficult to do a job well done. They were very critical.
bad,The safeway corporation doesnt care about there employees in the lower positions. turnover rates are very high. The pay is bad and generally a bad company to work for. atleast at my location.
bad,Safeway worked for me at the time; Now I am educated and ready for a career.
bad,"Upper management is horrible. Worse than high school. A lot of  back stabbing and trying to make people lose their jobs. Your only allowed to take your lunch. Taking your 15 minute break is frowned upon and looked at being lazy. Any vacation or personal time you earn won't get used. You practically have to cry and beg to get a vacation. They don't care about family.  All they care about is their bottom line. Everyone who works here hates it. They might love it at first, but give it a few years . They have you doing way too many tasks each day expecting you to finish. If you don't finish they bad mouth you to other employees.Not wanting to help get you raises or promote when they are highly deserved. If your not managements favorite, you won't go far."
bad,"My typical day starts at 2am and run to 11am  three days a week and then I work 4am to 1pm two days a week.  You will definitely will learn time management and work with customers on a large scale. though the management needs a lot of work on how to manage the departments, many are nice people.  Many of my co-workers are great to work with, but there are those who need to be lead and given tasks on an minute by minute bases.  Trying to get the tasks that are required for you to do are to numerous and with direct customer service many of the tasks do not get done and then you are asked why? The enjoyable part of my job is the customer service when I get all of my many tasks complete I can just focus on my customers and enjoy that part of the job."
bad,I give my all to anything I do. I was extremly let down with Safeway and the way they treat there employees especially there Management team. I do however miss my team. They were an incredible group of people. They were the reason I kept coming.
bad,"Awful hours. Although an employee may gain more and more responsibility, he or she is not promised a raise with any change in title."
bad,"Under appreciated employees, taken advantage of by higher ups."
bad,"Safeway was a horrible place of work. You could do everything the management did and receive less than half the pay for it. I worked there two years and received only one EIGHT CENTS/HOUR raise, and the hours are a joke. You're lucky to get a whole 20 hours a week. "
bad,It is hard to balance work and life with safeway when you work nights
bad,"20years ago, fantastic. Now a pathetic place to work, only good for a short temporary stop. Only a last resort for a job."
bad,"While Safeway is a decent company, they discriminate against women, at least with my experience. My boss at this job would not let me take vacatoins, and one time tried to fire me because I flew home to see my family. She lost my two week notice for this job and I had to write another one. She had me doing inventory, when I was a deli clerk and inventory was a managers job, and would yell at me if I didn't do it correctly, or didn't do it fast enough. It takes three years to get a raise at Safeway if you're a woman. If you're a man, they bump your pay up without telling you, and without the knowledge of the union. I was sent home once because there was one wrinkle in my shirt. The pay is very low, the management is terrible, and it's a lot of unnecessary stress."
bad,"Lackluster management lead to poor and hazardous work conditions, discriminatory and preferential treatment. The people worked with were wonderful and supportive people and hardworking. The typical day would include unloading of palates from the warehouse and stocking the shelves, ordering new product, and general organization of the back-stock. The hardest part of the job for any employee was the lack of driven or supportive management."
bad,"A typical day, what I learned and management; the answer is the same: swim or sink."
bad,"Insecure work place with little or no communication to help in the responsibilities. I was there as a Project Manager for nearly two months struggling to create the documentation, before I was informed there was a PMO and templates to help. People were let go at whim."
bad,"I enjoyed doing this kind of work, the people were friendly and the environment was friendly. There was never a boring moment. But I was paid under the minum wage of only $7. 15 Per hour. This wage was not suporrting. They only schedule my work hours at 15 per week. I couldn't live on this. I was told during the interview upon being hired that I would be making $9.00 Per hour. After I began working and I recieved my first pay check I noticed they did not pay me what they said they would. So I imformed the manager of the mistake and she said she will fix it and another pay week came up and she never fixed it. I was now short twice the amount. So I spoke to the other manager and he said she was working on it, at the end of the third week when the problem was not corrected, I quit the job and reported them to the dept of labor."
bad,"As an employee for safeway, i endured a few injuries outside of work, management blatantly REFUSED to let me call in sick after getting assaulted, i had to walk into work with a doctors note (keep in mind my head was bleeding still, i had an intense concussion and a bad limp) at which point the management literally started yelling and cursing at me for missing work. I've been stuck with countless shifts that have less than 8 hours between them, 0ver 12 hours in a day, more than 6 days of work a week, and over 45 hours in a week. Management could not accomplish most store functions, including BASIC cash register operations."
bad,Safeway died when sobeys took I over but frankly even before that it was a unfair place to work. People with old contracts made way to much and did next to no work
bad,When I was working there the staff seemed to form cliques. There wasnt really any teamwork. Very much so fending for yourself.Managemeny didnt seem to care about the schedules even when there were errors.
bad,"I worked for Safeway for 5 years total (2 years in high school, and 3 years when I was in college) and the experience was completely dependent on your managers. They used to offer a lot of career advancement and opportunities to improve your income. The culture seemed to shift away from that when they changed ownership"
bad,"This may not be true for all of them, but the Chestermere Safeway has the worst deli manager. She is nasty, mean, condescending, patronizing and rude. She acts as a dictator who doesn't know how to schedule, your time is not respected, your availability does not matter. Instead of training, you get yelled at and belittled for not knowing things you weren't trained in. Store manager is cocky and pompous. No regard for his employees at all, if you are disabled good luck, they don't care."
bad,I have worked there for almost 4 years and got 2 raises and am topped out in my department. I am constantly having to work by myself or with people who are not capable or unwilling to work. I wish they would hire and keep competent people but payroll seems to be the driving force behind all their decisions.
bad,Two faced They say one thing but do another they say they care they don’t tell you you’re going to be hired full-time but it’s part time they offer advancements after too much time and too little money
bad,"Instead of hiring good help like myself and giving a decent wage, benefits and respect.  Corporate thinks they can just keep overturning the help.  Not only does this effect employees but also the customers too.  Customers are your "" Business""!  Employees are not happy for having to work 21 days on with no time off 10-12 hr days.  The customers aren't  happy when your products and services are lacking of no help"
bad,"They were inconsistent in how giving shifts, giving me hours on times of the day where I needed to be class even when I told them why I couldn't work those days."
bad,Extremely boring job. Coworkers were nice but the management was abysmal. Constantly on my back even though the store was rarely occupied. They were also extremely fake to the employees.
bad,This is a good job first job. This job is not one that could support a family. The hours are unreliable. The shifts are unreliable. The management has their hands tied on most things. Management tends to side with the customer over their employees.
bad,The manager/employee ratio was about 1 manager/2 employees. The people working there were often lazy or unprofessional. No respect for work/home life balance. They expect you to break yourself for them while paying you minimum wage.
bad,"Safeway Pharmacy has very little employee appreciation. It is more like, pass the buck and see who it lands on. The best thing about this company is that you are a part of a union and they actually have your back."
bad,"Working at Safeway could be fun at times "
bad,The pace was always fast. If there were no customers than there are a hundred other things that must be done. The training was minimal and through computer simulations. Managers are rarely easy to find. Schedules are ever-changing and minimally discussed with employees. The hardest part of the job was that coworkers didn't look out for each other. They were angry all the time and most were pretty half-hearted about working there at all.
bad,"I worked at Safeway as a Food Clerk.  I cut fruit, and vegetables and packaged them for customers to purchase.  A typical day at work included cutting a large quantity of produce for two to three hours a day during an eight hour shift.  The immediate supervisor (Produce Manager), and lead food clerk were rude, and phony.  The workplace culture is unprofessional.  Teammates at this store squeal on one another to all levels of management.  The produce manager at this store demands the food clerks to use rotting produce to sell to customers.  I experienced disparate treatment by my immediate supervisor, and teammates.  The hardest part of the job was working with hostile teammates.  The lead food clerk, and immediate supervisor did not train me.  I had to improvise the process in order to do my job.  I enjoyed cutting, and packaging produce at this store because it was a low stress job."
bad,"Working for Safeway used to be great, we had 40hrs p/week and pretty good pay, but with newer contracts the possible for raises is pretty much non-existent."
bad,"dispatchers  play favorites even though it's a union shop. some forced dispatch. union representation is week."
bad,The work culture is average.  Managers are not involved.  The pay is not great.  Raises are minimal (by a few cents).  You may have to work late consistently.
bad,"This experience might be unique to my particular store, but the management is either highly incompetent or willfully destructive in their decision making."
bad,"Wouldn't work there again. Never was able to make plans due to schedule changing weekly. A couple gals were rude to me a lot, and no one cared if you're drunk while working like most of them are.. Also minors cleaning bodily fluids which is against code... "
bad,Management doesn't fight for their employees.   I had my manager standby and allow a customer to call me a a racial slur and then tell me that i still had to help the customer.
bad,The union representatives recently called the executives of safeway “retail slumlords.”  Which I think sums up this company and it’s higher ups perfectly.
bad,"Management would consistently switch, not give clear direction or manage their employees. Their was no drive. Pay was also very low, with hours being hard to adjust and tailor to your own schedule."
bad,"Not enough caring for employee and customer relations anymore. The best thing is that they offer union positions still. Every time you find a product you like, they seem to stop caring the item all together."
bad,"Insufficient pay and long hours with little to no breaks sporadic schedule no holidays poor managment and lack of care/attention to detail, at times very negligent"
bad,"Store manager was nonexistent, just leeching off of his guaranteed salary pay while the rest of the managers pick up the slack that they're not responsible for and don't have the time for."
bad,They overhire early and weed everyone out by severely cutting hours until someone gives up and quits. Would not recommend. They said they would pair me with someone in the bakery at all times but instead I was alone with too much on my plate for one person.
bad,Its a good job if you need a job. Although it is good to be aware that there are not many opportunities for advancement or raises. Management is poor and often changes.
bad,Not good wages for the kind of work ethic they are asking for and little to no opportunities to advance. The workplace can be unhealthy at times with lots of unnecessary high school drama. They often overload the good employees with too much of a workload and are strict on overtime which makes the job far more stressful than it needs to be if you're looking to succeed. The most enjoyable part of the job is usually the social aspect of it because within the departments there is usually a level of commodore among the the lower level employees.
bad,I started working for Safeway 14 years ago and 3 years ago the company was sold to an Investment group. The department I spent most of my 14 years in was not employee oriented and being a good worker did not allow you advancement. There was no work/life balance.My coworkers were great.
bad,You get a 15 minute break. If you are a second or a minute late they call your full name over the PA system. Management could use some courses in compassion.
bad,It was a company that was out of touch with its employees and the market it was in. It was behind the curve in its ability to adapt to the changing economy.
bad,"Understaffed, low pay, non consistent hours. Poor leadership. Poor training. I worked in the meat department and the people were quite nasty at the branch I was at. Very homophobic and racist"
bad,"Safeway Dot com is overly stressful for the actual work you are given, with no breaks, and extremely early work days. You can be employed for decades and still be labeled as part time unless you decide to do serous boot licking for the Corporate faceless suits, you will almost never see. Your benefits are non existent, as work for those already retired they seem to like it fine enough."
bad,let me tell you about the poor management at this company. it was so unfair and unprofessional. My manager would put all of her work on the other employee while she sat on her phone wasting company time. would place the blame on a fellow coworker and report to the store manager to get them written up. upper management did nothing because she was a manager. overall i'm glad I don't work there anymore
bad,"As a cashier you are told to stand at your cash register for up to eight hours with one or two 15 minute breaks. If it gets busy, then the time working there passes by quickly, but if there is no business, you just stand at your cash register doing nothing. The management at my specific Safeway that I work at is abysmal. They stay hidden in their office and do not come out and try to help out around the store. This also leads to some co-workers of mine thinking that they can do whatever they want and not actually work. The management also does not care if you ask for sick days or personal days off. They will still write you into the schedule and then task you with finding someone to replace you for the day."
bad,"This establishment's location actually went out of business. The manager, PennyJones, was absolutely horrible to all of her employees and overoworked everyone she could. The store would be messy and infested with roaches regularly. The upkeep was awful."
bad,I worked for safeway for little over a year and it has been the worst working environment I've ever been in. Toxic work environment and poor management and hours. Overworked employees for full time positions. And unsafe work place due to dangerous cutomers.
bad,"As someone who had worked in many different departments, I would not recommend this organization.  I found the management to fail much and the staff and overall environment toxic."
bad,"The night crew I worked with was great. the management, on the other hand, slandered us when something beyond our control went south. got full-time hours but couldn't get benefits because we were ""part-time""."
bad,"Applied as courtesy clerk but was recommended Bakery Dept. for good hours as told. But Did not receive good hours in THE FIRST 3 & half weeks worked as bakery clerk..other bakery clerk would go & talk to manager or people, or play w cell phone while i did all the dirty work for them (Most of the work)..worst position ever. I was guaranteed good hours as told by manager but was not satisfied w hours i was given..poor low hours "
bad,"The job is stressful. There's never enough help, the pay isn't high enough for the stress you're under. There's no support, they rarely work with school schedules, and you always hear what you do wrong, but never when you do a great job-like increasing sales 30%."
bad,"Job was very difficult due to poor management, lack of workers and more work than can be accomplished in one shift. Typical day at Safeway consisted of bagging items, returning merchandise and returning carts. Hardest part of the day was bagging items with only one bagger during busy hours. Most enjoyable part is talking to customers and meeting new people."
bad,"There were no issues with my immediate coworkers. Management however, was not very good. They frequently made mistakes, instigated gossip, and generally don't care about employees."
bad,This is a perfect job for a teenage kid in high school. Definitely not a good company for a  long term career. Good learning experience to get some knowledge on what to expect from an employer.
bad,"Management was horrible dispatch was horrible ,    Very on organized and I never felt like they even cared about me .  They would never give me enough hours to pay my bills it was impossible dispatch would call you off at least once a week and sometimes I would only have like four deliveries to make if I could a got 40 hours out of them I would’ve been happy because the job was basically easy just not enough hours management was terrible and they just don’t really care about you"
bad,"Management plays favorites and its a mess. "
bad,Its very hard to get scheduled hours especially if you have availability issues revolving around a family or children. Pay does not reflect cost of living in area. Severely under staffed.
bad,"Typical day was working in the gas station, some days working in the store at the register. Was generally called to the register when there wasn't enough staff.Not a career choice but it was a job. Better than Walmart."
bad,I work in  the deli from 3pm to 11pm. I help customer's when they need it.I cut meat and make salad's.I also help clean after the store closes.I am also reasonable for put thing away at the end of the nignt.
bad,dont reccomend anyone work here .......managers come and go all the time training is horrible and they treat their employees like garbage its also a union company and the union doesnt do anything but collect your dues
bad,"As I progressed in Safeway, sometimes everyday would be different. Sometimes I would be in the check stand as a cashier, or id be at Starbucks as a barista, on the floor as a day stocker, or I was training to become Customer Service. It gave me different things to do everyday which was refreshing. The hardest part about my job is that I was doing a four person job and not receiving the hours or pay for it. Four departments and was only receiving 25-30 hours when I have completely open availability. Hearing the customers complain about things to completely agree on; the store being dirty, over crowded with merchandise, short staffed in every department. Nothing would ever be done about anything."
bad,"There are never enough people to do the job, and they work you until you refuse.  There is no longer a customer focus to the store and it is not about the customer.  Management is more concerned with what you have done for them versus what you have done for your customers."
bad,"everything was good in the beginning until i started working different departments. you never stayed in one place more then a few day, would shift you between days and overnights every other day. worked there for 5 years was never given a raise in pay, the pay was not worth the amount of work you did, management was pretty bad very nit picky and always gave me the guilt trip if i couldn't stay past work hours even if you always stay when they ask any other time"
bad,"Constant work and very little time to breathe, while a fun job to have at times, management always wanted more done then was possible with the staff that they had. Other Staff constantly stressed and not very nice. However the customer service was always the top priority, and positivity was always present when dealing with customers. my favorite part of the job was being able to help people get what they want."
bad,"aside from a few good co workers and a few supervisors the management was horrible, they looked over employees who have been there for more than a year to newer employees for advancement and leave the others at a dead end position"
bad,"Micromanagement is just a part of another day at work. If you  find good co-workers and can get along with them you'll be fine, but most are just crazy, require a boatload of patience to deal with, and aren't professional."
bad,"The store i worked out wasn't very organized and was willing to let go of employee's who weren't willing to handle one department by themselves. when it came to closing it would come down to three people to handle the whole store. It was a mess, it was stressful and a lot for someone trying to work part time. There was so much lack of co-workers and a lack of communication. They assistant manager at my job was always nice to ask for things but ask anything from him like a simple where is something and he would act like he wanted to fire you on the spot. I didn't' think all Safeway stores are like this but they need to help employees want to work there not drive them away."
bad,"Safeway isn't what it was.  Salary min wage and wage bumps at very small over long periodic intervals.  Management is not really your friend in this union environment and the union can't really do much unless there is a clear case of discrimination of sorts.  Even contacting the union, management will lower your hours or threaten to do so. Safeway being a competition with more and more supermarkets, it is more cut-throat than ever.  I can't recommend Safeway as a career path in good conscience."
bad,Daily basis staff is not trained to work effectively. Manager and the manager of the store disagree with order of work to be done on a daily basis. Need to get work assignments in writing to ensure that you do the work that is needed
bad,"They could care less about overworking you, or the fact you have a family to go home to. They have mandatory ""day off"" work days. So good luck making plans on your day off. They give you a schedule, however it's not what it says it will be. The management cares nothing about you. It pays good and gives you benefits. Expect to have an unexpected schedule, and have NO personal life as you will be exhausted at times."
bad,"Wasn't a huge fan of this place. Management only like each other, and they get upset when you come to them with issues about scheduling. They expect you to put work before school."
bad,I have learned how to do Starbucks and Floral. The hardest part about my job is my Starbucks manager. I learn how be a lot more patient with people and getting yelled at.
bad,"Safeway is an okay starting job for a 16 year old kid or someone trying to get back on his feet. But as soon as they realize you are a hard worker, they will trap you and take advantage of it because a hard worker to them is like nugget of gold to an alaskan."
bad,"The management sucks and it hard to get hours, "
bad,"literally felt like and was treated like aslave every day I clocked in. Management doesn't care about you as a person, only about ""hitting the numbers."" Employee moral lower then I've seen anywhere else."
bad,"It was the first job I ever had, but if I could go back and change anything about it I would never have applied. The way I was treated there as a courtesy clerk was far beyond what I would consider an ok work environment. Very little of the staff was grateful for any help I provided and many times others put their workload on me because I was the lowest rung of the latter."
bad,They schedule minimal hours and EXPECT you to correlate your life around your job. They schedule minimal hours with expectation of you staying to commit to the jobs needs.
bad,A typical day at work would be me showing up at 4am everyday to start getting the deliverys ready for shipment later in the day. I love working with all the people and also have my freedom to do my task on my own time. The one reason why I left was because my son started to get sick very often and having to work 3 to 4 11hr days in a row takes a told on me not just at 4am employee but as a single working mother. It was a great opportunity to work there I just had to put my son first.
bad,"I was a Florist when the new store on Sunset opened. They hired hundreds of people to help get the store running and I was one of the hundred or so who got laid off when they realized they hired too many people."
bad,If you are a kid and need a summer job its not a bad learning environment. But overall its not the kind of place you want to work if you have goals in life.
bad,I have worked for Safeway for almost 13 years and this has to be the worse place I have ever worked.  All the employees talk bad about other employees and management treats employees horrible.
bad,A typical day would be seeing your favorite customers and friends and putting a smile and there faces.. You start to learn alot about your coworker and customer. I love working for the company before we got new management they do not care about your situation outside of they company it like they only want to make there bonuses and could careless about the underdogs who do the most and best for the company. The hardest part of the job is not being able to meet the customer satisfaction and the most enjoyable part was seeing all the same smiling face of customer over the years
bad,"Safeway employees are often rude and inconsiderate of one another and of customers. The overall environment is unprofessional and trashy, and there were many occasions when employees came to work high or smelling of alcohol and marijuana."
bad,"The best part of the job is definitely the customers. Some can be extremely nice. Lots of standing. Mornings can be a nightmare. How are YOU first thing in the morning with out your coffee?"
bad,"Compensation is decent, however, they expect you to work a lot. Long work hours (12+ hour shifts), oftentimes with minimal/no tech help.  Disorganization has led to inaccurate paychecks, benefits not reflecting what was promised upon hiring, frequent vacation denials. Tense work environment and retaliatory management. Lots of pharmacist turnover recently."
bad,"Ive never been treated so unfairly by management in any other job but safeway. When an individual in the workplace feels scared, intimidated, or uncomfortable due to abuse or intimidation by a coworker, it creates what is called a hostile work environment. While any number of behaviors might create a hostile work environment, any conduct or actions that create an environment in which an employee dreads going to work is generally seen to create such a setting. A hostile work environment is sometimes referred to as an “offensive work environment,” or an “abusive work environment.” The individual causing a hostile work environment may be an employee, a supervisor, an owner, or even and independent contractor. There are federal and state laws in place to protect employees from being subjected to workplace hostility."
bad,this is the most depressing job that i have ever worked at the environment is negative and the customers are rude and the managers do not care about their staff
bad,"No clear instructions for months, bearly any comfortable hours, absolutely random schedule, and extremely short breaks. The manager was unethical and unfair."
bad,"Safeway was a great job I loved working with the company.and Co workers I had some medical and church events and they worked with with me with that , it just seemed like a good job"
bad,"SImple easy job, days went by quick, management was awful. would never work for safeways company again. they expect everyone to share dirty raincoats, never washed, hours randomly get cut back."
bad,I worked at Safeway 6 years.It's a hard low paying job.Most people hate it there.I like most of the customers and my co-workers.I would' rather not work there again.
bad,"A typical day working there was chaos. I learned that a job is a job is a job and to just keep looking for something better. Management was terrible. Hardly ever made an attempt to connect. Co-workers were all very awesome. However, there was a lot of complaining amongst them. The hardest part of the job was clocking into the madness everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I get to listen to my music while I was working."
bad,"I thought that Safeway will be worth going to, since I was having problems at my McDonalds job. Boy, I was so wrong and I completely regret coming here, There are so pros to this place, but be warned, the negative out ways the positive."
bad,"Depending on the department you work in things vary widely as to  overall employee happiness. In my expeirnce, management is poor at lower levels, only the popular are promoted-not by merit; salary at lower levels is obismal, and communication is poor. If you are lucky enough to have a competent manager who does not micromanage, feel blessed."
bad,"Coworkers and patients are great and have been loyal through several changes. There are way too many expectations for the amount of help allowed. After several years, ready to call it quits."
bad,The average day consisted of me getting yelled at by the manager for not doing the work that she assured me the previous day that she did and then she would leave cleaning up the kitchen mess from the earlier shift.  A majority of my time there was only me and the Manager as seafood staff.  While working there I learned a lot about about the differences in various seafood.  The hardest part of my job was constantly having my hours threatened by my department manager for doing what my district manager would tell me to do.  The most enjoyable part of the job was going to the deep freezer to get seafood.
bad,"A typical day at work is going in and providing excellent customer service to every customer individually to make the experience more personal. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to see my baked products and take pride in the quality of them along with seeing the customers walk away pleased. The most difficult part of my job is struggling with the lack of communicational skills that my manager and assistant managers have. I try to find ways to make everyone's jobs easier by communicating, but unfortunately, the managers do not feel the same. There are a couple co- workers that I work well with as they do with me. They are incredibly hard workers and take pride in their work as I do."
bad,"The paychecks don't bounce and the schedules get put up regularly, which is more than I can say for my last job."
bad,Didn't like the Manager's attitude towards the employees and to some customers. Had to complete other peoples task and responsibilities. the hardest part of the job was pushing carts in as quickly as i can and getting in trouble for not doing the amount im supposed to do every shift change
bad,working for safeway was very interesting. It had its good days and its bad days but I got tiered of doing a hard job and getting paid hardly anything.
bad,"as a courtesy you could not advence and the union treated you less than human, cost of living increase, nope not for the courtesies, they dont need to live. if someone just didnt want to do their job they just got a courtesy to do it. if you make a mess get a courtesy to clean it while you watch. have a weekly task that your job title requires you to do, get a courtesy. dont want to hire someone new to do a job that pays decent just fill it with a courtesy."
bad,"love working with the public but the company is very stressful to work for, my bakery manager is wonderful though she tries very hard to get everything done but they keep cutting the hours in the bakery and there is just not enough time to get everything done that they want."
bad,"Initially I started morning to afternoon shifts, which entailed loading up shipments of product on to carts which would then be unboxed and distributed among the department. Afterword, I'd begin food preparation for the first cooks, and afterward serve the cooked food. This was all while handling counters and serving other customers as necessary."
bad,The merger with Albertsons has made this company go through changes.  Safeway used to be focused on superior service and quality but now the merger has put focus on profits and competition.
bad,"bad place to work, not very supportive, never really worked around my schedule. Very easy, all you did was stock the floor and make sure the bad product was out, but very bad place to be."
bad,"the company has gone down hill.$8.85 per hour? really??? you need $60,000 to live in a single family home In Maryland! union? FORGET IT! waste of dues! employees come and go before you learn their names! LOTSA LUCK!!!"
bad,"To make a long story short, safeway is not a ideal workplace for me personally. The management is poor, there is no room for promotions really, hours are always scarce and everyone works at their own paces business wise. Every thing seems off schedule and never really in order. Ive been employed by three different locations and didn't like none of them for all them same reasons. Ive suggested Safeway as a employment opportunity to some of my friends and it hasn't been a good move for them either. I know we're all not perfect and may not be aiming to become, but this isn't somewhere you could build a career from."
bad,The management was poor. The job itself was not tood bad but i am now looking for change. A new life needs to start with a new job.
bad,Ok job to work at. The management was alright but co workers were friendly. Easy job if you have good people skills. Hardest part was taking over someones shift.
bad,"Position Duties"
bad,"Cashier, balance out cash drawers, balance and audit vault, relieve breaks and lunches for employees, handle customer/employee issues, run grocery store, help all departments"
bad,Not a great place to work for. A lot of problems with management and coworkers there secret shopper program is a bunch of garbage avoid working here!
bad,"Everybody to him/herself, no cooperation. Co workers mostly aloof."
bad,"Best job I've had all around. great people in the community, best benefits I've also had."
bad,"Round up carts at least 10 times in a 5 hour shift, while bagging groceries for customers, cleaning up spills, making sure restrooms are kept clean, and facing all store products. i learned that costumer service is key to a successful business. management was okay. Co-workers were okay as well. the Hardest part of the job was during holiday season staying on top of all tasks that were assigned while making sure to greet and help every costumer who entered the establishment. the most enjoyable part was dealing with all kinds of people."
bad,"I was fired after only a month and a half, because I wasn't up to speed. Meanwhile, all the other girls who were hired at the same, and have the same life situation, were given at least 3 more shifts weekly. "
bad,A push and pull game between management and employees where the employee will find fault in anything that goes wrong in the store.
bad,my typical day at work is face paced. i enjoy my days there the people are GREAT the pay is sad!
bad,Average pace. Some co-workers are friendly. Some customers are friendly. Only met one manager that I liked.
bad,"more of life needs with them ,you had to be in the right place at right time."
bad,"safeway was more of a starting ground for me, some of the co-workers where nice others just where rude and disrespectful. honestly i can say that it wasn't the right job for me."
bad,"A typical day at work for me is running around assisting customers, making sure the store stays clean and in order, and also keeping everyone happy. Though I can say over the years Safeway has taught me how to work with people of all ages and cultures and also how to remain leveled under stressful situations. There is really no hard part in my job as long my team members do their job and when they dont do that, thats when it becomes hard. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of my job is just being able to meet alot of new people and really interact with the public."
bad,"My day at work seemed to take more out of me than it should. Management will not work with you to meet in the middle. To corporate, the individual is seen as expendable, and will be exploited and taken advantage of. I felt very unappreciated each and every day. There is little to no room for improvement or advancement. The company totally undermines The Union."
bad,"High turnover rate at this company. The schedule is always late and changed when it is put out, people call out a lot. Management did not want to help customers."
bad,very hard work and very little pay in a very negative atmosphere
bad,"A typical work day was greeting customers and ringing up their groceries. Time was allowed for small talk to build a continued working relationship with regular customers. I learned how to communicate better with people. My co-workers were like family; we all got along great and helped each other with job duties. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with new policies, and dealing with new management that would change things on us, but not get to know us. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know so many different types of people."
bad,"What use to be a great place & profit sharing, nice in environment to work has turned to corporate greed !!!!"
bad,"This was once a wonderful company to work for, and was a place you could make a career out of. Unfortunately, our management has made poor choices over the last decade, and our pay has fallen drastically below what it once was in terms of buying power. Our benefits have gone up significantly in cost while going down in quality. Entry level wages have fallen below fast food, and our turn over is high."
bad,Was a great starting job not going to lie. Not great for a long term goal though. There is room to grow if your willing to give up you sense of dignity. A lot of favoritism. Best to get in and get out for you job and to find a new job once you receive enough experience to get a new job
bad,"Great job for HS kids or retired folks.  Expectations are high and advancement is slow.  If you value customer service and a fast pace, this is a job you will enjoy."
bad,"No matter how many years you work there, they still won’t give you a raise. The management will blame you for something you didn’t do, but some people are nice to work with.. just not management."
bad,"• Lead a 3-man team planning and scheduling shifts for indoor and outdoor customer services"
bad,Horrible company now. Safeway used to care about employees once it sold out took all 90% fulltime employees down to 25hrs which isn't even enought to pay for roof over head.
bad,"My employment with Safeway electric was full of competitiveness for a better position that does not exist, they will work you like a slave, than lay you off, they're all family and friends which makes it difficult to feel comfortable, also the language barrier was terrible and made me feel as though they were saying things behind my back."
bad,In the short time I worked there in one year the store went through eight managers. No consistency in the direction of employees with no consistent management.
bad,Terrible company to work for. I had health issues. They promised to work with me yet continued to schedule me the hardest shifts and full time even though I wasnt physically able to.
bad,"Safeway, as a company, can be a good starter job to go with. However, the hours are inconsistent and inflexible, and it will consume most of your time. I cannot with a good conscience recommend this place. There's very little time for you and a lot more time for the company, and due to it's change to Albertsons ownership I especially wouldn't work there if I were you. It is a hostile work environment, at best."
bad,"Safeway did not provide any training or leadership upon starting my position. Additionally,the coworkers I worked with on the overnight shift were more concerned with their individual numbers instead of working together as a team and helping each other out. "
bad,Safeway is a very hard company to work for. very tight on there schedules to the point of one person doing 4 jobs. And they don't care if a store in Idaho has a full staff case minimum wage is lower. the expectation is that one person to do what three people do at a store of equle sales  Volume. To be ran and look the same. And will write you up if it dose not.
bad,"predatory towards employees and customers alike, company gone way downhill under sobeys, with policies getting worse and worse as higher-ups maintain a culture of intolerance and harassment"
bad,"The job was okay, the management was what I personally had a problem with. I would request days off months in advance and not get them off and then when i couldn’t work because of the events that occurred on those days I got fired."
bad,"The particular store I worked at was very poorly managed. We where constantly understaffed, underpaid, and management offered little praise ever, it was only ever micro-managing, not to mention it was impossible to move up. Numerous people who had been working there for decades, retained jobs as cashiers. Management also had an issue with never standing up for employees. The vast majority of the time they let us be treated horribly, and would never take into account the other side of the story. Not even when the customer was blatantly in the wrong (one guy got a bagel thrown at him and the customer was allowed back in the store as if nothing happened, it was even caught on camera!). My particular department was fine. However I was working almost full time to full time (back then as a minor mind you which is illegal) when I got hired as a part time employee (25 hrs or less) going to school full time as a 16/17 year old, and I couldn't get a cut in hours because management insisted we where 'fine'. I cant speak for other Safeway locations, but to sum it up, this place was a mess the entire time I worked there. And from what I heard from co-workers, other locations weren't much better. Its an easy job, but only if you're willing to work way more than you want, and deal with poor management."
bad,I would reccomend safeway to someone who needs work and able to be flexible with work schedule alot of people get hired at once and not everyone wants to work so if you are ready to work I would recommend
bad,"Management will schedule the most irregular shifts possible. The building is old, cramped, and a terrible eye sore. Most of the grocery employees don't work very hard. But at least at lunch time, you'll enjoy being on Whyte avenue."
bad,"I have worked in a lot of different jobs in my life but this one is by far the worst. But like many employees i am traped here. At one time 20 plus yrs ago this was a good paying job and the treated you right. But we make less every year and the cost of living has sky rocketed. But our great union gets us an 80cent raise every 5yrs.  The management team has 0 leadership skills the corporate team has the same great leadership skills"
bad,They treat you horrible lack of respect and compassion they don't understand you and the hours and pay suck definitely not a worth while job management uses their title to one up their employees
bad,Need more hours and better management. When dealing with customers they'll always get what they want and you get reprimanded for any and everything even when its not your fault.
bad,Safeway is poorly run and employees are expected to work long hours while dealing with extremely rude customers. Management is also rude and often condescending.
bad,"I worked there for a long time and always wanted more hours and begged and asked and begged for more hours, but never got them because they kept hiring people"
bad,"While I worked my but off to get promoted in a short time frame, there hasn't been any where near enough people in my department and no repurcussions for the current employees continuoully doing a bad job. So while we have vocalized for months we need people, the job(s) and too much of the responsibility falls on my shoulders. Due to call outs and not near enough staffing, my shifts are typically 9-10 hours apart. Currently, I have no life outside of my job and that's no way to live."
bad,"Its a union based company. I worked as a cashier for the Safeway Fuel station."
bad,I don't recommend working at Safeway at least in the Deli I constantly saw people treating poorly talked down to as well as gossip I even brought it to the directors attention and it was never addressed
bad,"My department manager was not trained in management and crossed boundaries all the time.  It made work difficult, but overall Vons is an OK place to work."
bad,"Management had no communication. Seemed like no one knew what they're responsibilities were, so they always pushed work onto another co worker. When brought up to upper management they would do little to nothing to fix the situation."
bad,"It's a nice place to work until you make one mistake. I made the mistake of calling out for the first time and I got put on a contract. Ever since then I've been treated poorly and I got suspended, which is bad, for being injured."
bad,Management and staff were horrible . I hated it there. Dont work there! Bad management horrible employees. Wont go back ever. Not worth the stress put me in the hospital
bad,"This was a J.O.B. for me- didn't find the fulfillment I was looking for. But to be fair, the company was going through a major restructure at the time I worked for them. I have a family member working for them now, and things seemed to have stabilized quite a bit."
bad,"managers play favorites, and are very passive aggressive. mindless work that requires no thinking or effort. they are good with flexibility with hours if your a student for example."
bad,"Very interesting and fast past meet people who still are there fun clean and learned different departments meet new people and management worked at several different locations in Denver area ran a crew up to 9 safety classes audits white glove etc. Food safety knowledge and changing tags changing rotation of the product checking dates everyday checking food temperature safety with cleaning products training new crew members sell products vocals etc. "
bad,"Since it's merger with Albertsons Companies, it has fallen apart.  No annual reviews are done so no one else besides your direct manager knows how hard you work or what you accomplished.  No raises most years but if you are given one it is offset by the increase in health care cost.  While health care cost went up benefits went down.   Company tries to maintain a positive image and hide all their dirty laundry."
bad,"i really didn't like working there. The management was terrible. "
bad,"Work was tiring but not hard. You theoretically told them what hours you were available for, but in practice they would just give you want hours they wanted you to take and if it was problematic... that was your problem."
bad,poor management they look at you as just less then. Cant plan vacations because you are not sure you will get it or if they block that mouth. they favor employees.
bad,I liked it was close to home. the only down fall to the Guerneville store was the manager she didn't know what she was doing and she would promise you a job in the store but never follow through. she played a lot of mind games for my taste. She told me I was hired at 12.50 an hours and got paid 10.10 an hour. I complained but she always had a excuse n blamed corporate. I called corporate and talk to a lady in HR n she never did anything about it. she said she would call manager but it seemed like the way she talked her and manager were friends so I knew it wasn't going anywhere.  I was there everyday on time and worked. I learnt all area of the different departments and told me by manager that I would become a night manager she needed one and that never came about so I got tired of it all the lies so I quit not knowing that she would quit about a few months later. if I had an idea she would quit I would of stuck it out. 
bad,"Have to be willing to work 15+ hour days about 7 days a week for weeks or months at a time throughout the year . Very strict on performance, if you don’t hit 100% you will get a write up"
bad,Safeway is a grocery store company that offers quality groceries to its customers. It is a little over average pricing but overall good quality and always fresh produce.
bad,"I enjoyed getting to know my coworkers and customers. Unfortunately this company only focuses on money and not the value of customers and staff. Safeway is all about sell sell sell, cutting hours, and do-what-I-say attitude."
bad,"My experience working for the company was adequate for the job itself. Most of the coworkers provided a pleasant experience, and made the job environment pleasant."
bad,"Expect to be over worked constantly, other employees constantly calling out and you having to pick up the slack. Correctional measures are only taken when management decides to make an example of you. Not worth the money you make. Customer are ignorant and always a pain to deal with. Reccomended as a job for kids fresh out of high school or older people nearing retirement not to provide for a family. Whistleblowers are constantly taking the heat instead of the actual employees not doing their job."
bad,Safeway made me feel as if I was in a hostile work environment. Always being made felt that I did something wrong when that wasn’t the case. Hours weren’t flexible to where I could balance school with work. I was forced to call in some days I was scheduled for hours I clearly stated I was not available  in the interview
bad,The management here is terrible.  They let the homeless congregate in the cafe area and they have started fights with customers and each other.  It's a very unsafe working environment.  I felt very uncomfortable.
bad,"A typical day was answering question, phones, constant interruptions, immunizations, filling many prescriptions. Management was changing hands since the merger with Albertson. I loved most of our patients because they were kind and caring. the hardest part was all the stress corporate put upon you to do more with less help."
bad,"It Aint that serious if your young and want a job real quick it will do... for now. Don't expect too much other than trash customers, trash pay and some fried chicken from the deli."
bad,"Staff was abrasive at best and didn't respond to questions well. They went through back routes in order to get you moved or fired. "
bad,"A typical day at work usually included cleaning aisles and bathrooms, bagging groceries, and pushing carts. Eventually the job only consisted of bagging groceries and we were not allowed to do most anything else. I didn't learn that much, but I did learn how to complete tasks on time and how to collaborate. The managers were mean and demanding, and they were often rude to employees who were asking questions. Workplace culture was apathetic. The hardest part of the job was bagging groceries, but the most enjoyable part of the job was pushing carts."
bad,"Safeway is like every other first job for any 16 year old. Even if it isn't your first job and you're an adult. They start you off with a fixed schedule, but stop honoring your availability  after a month. When you call managers to attempt to fix these issues, they don't. After a year, a raise was given, and expectations got worse. Many times one would be alone for 5 hours out the day in their department, without help. This causes breaks and lunches to get messed up, for which you get in trouble for, for not taking them as is scheduled. If you do choose to take them, expect to get in trouble for leaving your kiosk closed during open hours. Coworkers are usually miserable and awkwardly cliquey. A lot of drama.  Ended up quitting."
bad,"They don't like people getting to full scale pay, so they try to find anything they possibly can to get you fired. They're even willing to hire a private investigator to spy on fellow employees on their time off."
bad,"While the people I worked with were okay, the management left much to be desired and scheduling was a nightmare. You get crummy pay for working what they want you to do and there was a lot of turn over."
bad,The hours changed every week and usually were 20 to hours.  The hours changed every week and many times would drop to the minimum of 20 hours which is difficult to live with to pay the bills.
bad,I have good relationship with my coworker. but the management always are cutting hours which gives me hard time to survive because i am responsible person.that's why i got this certificate to improve my situation and also go back to my field.
bad,Not diverse what so ever everybody to themselves not upbeat if your a oler person maybe this might be a good job for you but not a young upbeat type of person
bad,"They need better management and to learn to follow laws and their """"rules"""" for safeway. When i worked their they didnt know how to do any of that and then some"
bad,I enjoyed working at Safeway when I had first started but as time went on we got a new manager and he was inconsiderate of the workplace and his employees. We were overworked and never acknowledged or appreciated.
bad,"Horrible management"
bad,"Most of the people who were younger were treated unfairly and as though they were beneath those who were past their 30's. Would not recommend working here. Other than there benefits package, that was the only enjoyable thing."
bad,Working At Safeway Was A Stressful Experience Hours Were Always Cut We Never Knew If We Would Get A Full 40 Hours Per Week  Or Less And Management Was Terrible.
bad,Worked for a few months and hours were eliminated completely with no explanation. Attempted many times to find out why but kept getting no answers and was just redirected to other department managers.
bad,"Most workers take pride in their work, and were a pleasure to work with, but a lot of other employess especially those who have been in the company for a while and know how to manipulate the system can be a big burden to all their colleagues."
bad,"Pay is minimal, often dropping below minimum wage after union fees. Benefits are minimal. Employees come and go. Managers don't care what your think. No room for advancement in any area. Employees know more about how the store runs than the managers and managers often have to come to customer service to ask us how to do simple tasks."
bad,"Had a man that was 20 come in and ruin things by saying he would work on backstock then end up not doing it. He also took credit for our work. Higher management was completely hands off, leaving us to our own devices even when we needed guidance. They would often get angry if the ridiculous loads were not finished on time as if it were even possible"
bad,great place to start.  I started right out of high school.  I would recommend Safeway to high school students to help meet hours while going to school. I met good friends there.
bad,Management at this store was very bad.  Hours per day were always less than 5.  They promise more hours but would hire more employees and cut every ones hours so they didn't have to pay benefits.
bad,"Poorly ran, poor pay (always taking large fees from paycheck), scheduling was extremely poor, and overall just highly disliked the job. Managers would say certain things, and not hold true to there word."
bad,"Very cliquey, managers would pay favorites.  Job had a lot of requirements; too much for for not enough pay.  It does vary by location, though, and my manager at the time is now gone."
bad,"A typical day at work would start with welcomes and hello's when I clock in to work. I would then get asked if I could work on what needs to be done the most such as carts, stocking, and facing. Management when you are a new hire can be different because they will treat them more aggressive in a way, but not too harsh. They will take advantage of you if you are a yes-man."
bad,"Aside from being in a cooler for 8 hours and waking up at 4am to cut fruits and get your sleeves wet, it was a pretty easy job up until the labor union tried to strong arm me into joining them and ultimately left me working one day a week. I was payed weekly so there werent many complaints from me. I didnt have to deal with customers and no one really bothered me unless i was out on the sales floor."
bad,"The store that I work at is one of the most interesting experiences."
bad,the people i worked among where very prejudice and disrespectful of other employees and customers. Many people there would follow people around the store simply based of their looks alone. Management was either disrespectful or careless.
bad,"Its okay to work here but it could be better. Love when they give you the opportunity to travel to different states to help out. Has much potential, but needs help"
bad,bad place to work. work is too demanding for too little pay. with minimum benefits. work place is stressful and tiring. very slow pace of career advancement.
bad,I worked with this company for a little over a year and was tricked into thinking moving from a courtesy clerk to a cashier was a promotion when in fact i found out i could have just applied for the job. I was used and manipulated into thinking my job was on the line constantly and when i decided to leave i was harassed and got a major hour cut because of it.
bad,"Makes working awful, terrible negative environment to work in. It was fun with regular customers and fun with some employees. Good for a temporary job to get you through school."
bad,"Never any training, it's who you know not what you know. Benefits are terrible no vision plan and mandatory union dues are taken out of the paycheck. Pay system is very confusing. Managers lack any leadership knowledge and ceos and upper management lack in understanding individual and group job roles while demanding and expecting way too much for the little financial compensation given."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Safeway.  The management at this company expected employees to be available to work the entire day, without any regard to the employee's personal life.  Employees are penalized for asking for time off."
bad,"Safeway is like a bipolar girlfriend. In the beginning it is sunshine and flowers. Things were great and I loved my job, but once they get a grip on you they change. That once loving girlfriend just hates you, doesn't let you know when you are supposed to come in. If you want a day off, forget about it. ""You are on a six month parole.."" They don't care if you are a teenager and have school work that's ""Not an acceptable excuse..."" You cannot be sick, because you are not a loud to be. Just don't do it."
bad,"I spent many years working for Safeway and no matter which store I worked at, it was all pretty much the same. The people who worked hard, were the ones who were expected to do the majority of the work, while the people who didn't work hard, were allowed to do as they pleased. The compensation was not fair either. For my skilled position, I made the same as the non skilled positions."
bad,"They do not have hand scanners have to lift to scan or type in numbers, management has favorites, and assistant management drags their feet when I or anyone needs overrides or help on register. They need to empower us with more so we don't have to keep the customers waiting. Hardest part of job is lifting all to scan."
bad,"co-workers are wonderful i love the work i do, but our store manager is a controlling bully who has not only yelled at me on the work floor with customers around but all employees in our store.  he talks down to everyone and has created a very stressful environment.  we've only had this manger about a month and our store has crashed with him there, our old manager had the store and employees in great shape we were like one big close knit family that all worked together.  theres a separation now from the negative manager."
bad,Underpaid and not enough working hours. Very busy and crowded. Very little advancement. Poor management. I do not recommend working for this company.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
bad,A typical day at work is long standing and short breaks (15 min) if working less the 6hrs. I learned a lot about retail by this being my first time.  A lot of standing and people's attitudes when services is poor because of management and scheduling.  Not enough cashiers because of cut back on schedule.  There are no problems with the culture of and the hardest part is long standing.  The most enjoyable is meeting the people most are very friendly and appreciate what I do.
bad,"I've met some of my greatest life-long friends through working at Safeway. However, management does not respect their employees and does not give room for advancement. As soon as they are desperate, they hire whoever off the street and the whole store goes into chaos. Managers are more worried about their bonus than the happiness of employees or customers."
bad,Starting off it seemed very nice at first but took bad turn soon after. Some of the managers I've encountered had very poor treatment to employees and myself.
bad,"Working at Safeway was the worst seven years of my working experience. The bakery was mismanaged. The people who were promoted were ""yes men"" and oft-times under qualified. The management took credit for all ideas from the hourly workers. Overall, this job was a disaster."
bad,"Day to day affairs weren't so bad, just monotonous tasks and customer interactions, but the management left something to be desired. No sympathy for injuries, sickness, or bereavement leave. If you called out sick, you were treated like garbage, and threatened to be written up because calling out once or twice a year was 'too much'. Pay raises were a joke, with raises based on hours worked, and not on the merit of the employee (union). No benefits for anyone less than full-time, no competitive salary. The most difficult part was dealing with belligerent customers, when the managers did not support their employees upholding the store policy. Staff were thrown under the bus on numerous occasions. By far, the most enjoyable part was bonding with coworkers over these same issues."
bad,work hours cant support a family nor basic living. the pay is to low for the fast pace position. the customers are great they just want to be treated with respect.
bad,Safeway has a poor work environment. Not one person truly wanted to be there and make a difference. I always heard the employees talking  bad about customers and their job.
bad,Would not pay for work injuries. Forced back to work when not completely healed. this all that i have for this review.  I now have a life time disability
bad,"A company like safeway/sobeys and the staff have to go to the food bank to survive.."
bad,"Most of management was lazy, they expected work FAR above each person's pay grade, and never appreciated when said work was completed, despite there being many more relevant things that could be done."
bad,Very busy with limited staff.  They cut hours all the time.  The benefits are good and only need to work 20 hours to get them. Seems like they care more about money than staff or customers.
bad,I would interact with many new people but a lot of the same regular customers as well. I would clean and maintain a clean work environment while interacting with customers and crafting the beverages.
bad,"Standard grocery and customer service job. Hours are low if you're not full time. You have to join and pay the union in order to work at Safeway. Benefits aren't that great and are provided by the union, lay-offs frequent, management likes to schedule you to work at stores without asking you if that's doable. After layoff I was sent a letter in the mail to report to a city 2 hours away if I wanted to start work again."
bad,"I was in the produce department mainly. My tasks were simple: fill new produce, get rid of bad produce, order more produce to come in."
bad,"Was very good working environment but I wouldn't recommend anyone to work in there fuel stations, nothing about this job was hard except trying work with lottery tickets"
bad,"I did not have a good experience working for Safeway. I was thrown onto the floor with minimal training, and treated as if I was dumb when asking questions. Many scheduling issues, and I hardly even knew who my ""boss"" was. Never got an employee discount. Management did not support staff but complained non stop. Very clique-y."
bad,Ultimately there is to much stress in any given position at this company relative to compensation. Not enough people to run any given facility and goals are unrealistic. Benefits package is awful and getting worse.
bad,"A decent place to work to learn how to manage inventory and handle customers of all kinds."
bad,"Would not work around my schedule. Am a full time college student they would not work around that, wanted more availability for a dead end job."
bad,"not an absolutely horrible job. Benefits get cut every other year due to weak union . most people that work there are miserable. Only guaranteed 24 hours a week . Takes at least 5 years minimum to get to top wages unless you're lucky. Could be improved by improving management and reforming corporate structure . If you're lucky you have a good management team and makes your job much better. I was never lucky there constant hour fluctuation , constant whining from management about little things and often mood swings or various corporate persons coming in and nagging about little things and you drop everything you're doing to do whatever they say then go back to whatever management whines about then back to your job . Would only recommend as temporary or side job for most persons. scheduling varies each week never constant hours or days off . generally no room for advancement"
bad,"Can't rely on H.R."
bad,management need to improve on how it treat it employees. they don't accept people that have a disability. they make fun of them. I know because I am disabled
bad,"To get 40 hours a week for an hourly employee, you have to be available all hours on the clock.   Work graveyard, swing, and day shifts- in the same week.  Different shifts each week, unless you are a member of the good old boys club, or are willing to sleep with them."
bad,"Company was not organized, Many changes with upper management that would not support lower managers.  Company had to down size a few different times."
bad,"The store was fine, my typical day of work consisted of bagging for customers and helping them to there cars while also gathering carts and putting away go backs. I dint learn a whole lot there because the management was very ""peculiar"" of who they let move up the ladder so to speak. My co-workers were very friendly for the most part, but a lot of them try and pry into peoples personal lives in between customer. the hardest part of the job had to have been getting carts in the blistering summer heat. the most enjoyable part was definitely being able to provide customer service to the customers."
bad,Saw way too much turn over since I've been there.  There are a couple corporate employees I think do a great job but I feel that their hands are tied but know the issue :) ..But again I do love what I do . I leave the rest to God.
bad,"Never been runned down to the ground in such a short period. "
bad,"Terrible, unreasonable management but flexible schedule and friendly coworkers. Not payed enough for the job requirements. Some of the things I had to do: Move a 300+ pound barrel full of grease without help, clean the hot fryers and ovens with sub par  saftey equipment."
bad,"My typical day would include cleaning, bagging groceries, collecting carts, and helping customers find thing or bring their groceries to their cars. I learned a lot about what bad management looks like. I also learned a lot about what I do not want to find in another job. MY co-workers were okay, but I feel like while we were all stuck under the same management, it made it very hard to be happy at work. The hardest part of the job would honestly have to be when I was up for promotion, and the manager hired her son and gave him the job instead. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the time spent talking to the customers who wanted the quality customer service."
bad,While working for the Starbucks kiosk it was a great experience. I really love Starbucks.There was no room for growth within the store let alone the company.
bad,"For the most part I like the employees I work with"
bad,"My department is new and has only been opened for a few months now. In the last month, we went from being fully staffed at 7 people, to being ""fully staffed"" at 3 people.  When we had 5 or more people, our hours we cut anywhere from 40 hours down to 20 or 32 hours, and then were asked to stay or told we couldn't leave until the holes on the shelves were filled.  Now that we're down to 3 workers, the demands for cutting, packaging, bowling and labeling the fruit bowls has been increased to 350 bowl in an 8 hour shift for the first person in the department, amounting to 50 bowls/hour, in which none of us are able to do."
bad,A typical day at work consist of coming in to great customers and friendly people.  Helping others and restocking shelves.
bad,"I appreciated the experience, and the knowledge I've gained working for this company. Great experience for young teen just getting into work force."
bad,"Safeway is not the best place to advance. It has a strict environment that's too focused on the customer. Employees are unhappy. Minimum wage is not motivating and raises are about 4 years to earn 10 cent raise. (""Keep the change..."")"
bad,On the Register taking care of customers in a timely manner. Co-Workers are very helpful. Hardest part of job is lifting big bags of dog food.
bad,"I was not happy with the people I worked with.  They were clickish and did not allow any new people to come into their little click.  "
bad,"Provided customer service, maintained the hygiene and cleanliness of the whole store, bagged groceries, returned carts, and restocked unwanted items."
bad,"Safeway was a good company to work for, for a little while. However the management at my site was extremely poor and I eventually quit because of it."
bad,There was very little personal feedback from supervisor. The few times there was contact they focused on negative. Most of the store were under staffed.
bad,"From the minute you clock in until the end of your day you will be on your feet and running around."
bad,"First of all, I'm grateful for Safeway giving me the opportunity for working for them. "
bad,"A typical day at work is busy, I learn how to multi-task an and be efficient with quality. We don't have a manager but the supervisors are understanding. My coworkers are very friendly an hard workers. to close an attend to customers. to interact with positive people an be productive at the same time."
bad,Manual labor and bagging groceries. Management was poor and I never felt like I was challenged to do more or be more for the customer
bad,"Working for Safeway is great if you like to go home everyday with your feet bleeding, stressed out, and getting paid minimum wage."
bad,"Lots of prejudice in hiring practice"
bad,Ok place to work at. Great start for an 16 year old first job. leaving for more experience and better pay.
bad,"On a typical day at work, I would go in, finish packaging the baked goods the morning staff didn't finish, then spend the rest of my shift cleaning. After I finished cleaning I would simply stand behind the bakery display for the rest of my shift. I had no one looking over me. I was the only one in my department. Sometimes, customers would ask me to get them a cupcake or cake or write on a cake for them. It was extremely boring and I was not trained to deal with cakes at all, I figured it out on my own. I had cashier training, because of the lazy management. They just showed me their default video. I did not ever have to deal with a cash register. They did not even train me on how to work the phone. No one would tell me what to do or give me more duties when I had nothing to do. My manager got fired for having intercourse in the break room with a co-worker. I didn't get to know my other manager well, since I left at the end of the summer. I only saw the bakery manager once, the day before I left. My assistant manager was mean and took advantage of the younger staff. She made them do her duties for her and she would not listen to the younger staff since she was so high up on her high horse. Most of my co-workers didn't speak English. I made two or three friends, but most of the staff just blew me off. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the boredom and poor management. There was no enjoyable part to this job. You don't get any discounts, the pay is very low and overall there are no benefits to working here. I will never apply to a Safeway job again."
bad,"Horrible management, Rude co workers, no possibility of much advancement. It's like you're stuck there in the same place for the rest of your life, miserable."
bad,tough to work for a company that doesnt value their employees
bad,"Being bought out by Sobey's is the best thing for this company. The only good part about the job was the money. Management is horrendous. It truly is an ""Old Boys Club"". Women advancing in this company is a joke. "
bad,It was my first job and i think i expected more than there was. I really didnt have much of a choice when it came to advancement.
bad,"good customers, good employees awful management staff ive learned how to fight the management with the union."
bad,"A typical day at work opening: Come in at 9 tired and sore, do temps/tares,markdowns, then put up the full service case. Halfway thru putting up the case you would hear managment on the intercom announcing the daily service huddle. One person from each department would come and talk about customer service in a huddle every day. At this point every one knows what we have to do just certain individuals keep our secret shopper % at the low 50s.Managment of course blames everyone and tries new ideas to get everyone excited for shops which never work. Its even gotten to the point where we have a daily exercise sheet where you observe fellow co workers role playing and write down how well they did.If you get a bad shop you have to do 30 of these sheets. The new store manager has really turned the place into a dictatorship. You come into work and we have about 2 cashiers at a time and lines of people waiting to be checked out and you can see why are sales are down and our customer service is so low. Nobody really wants to be at safeway, all the old timers got comfortable with their checks and with the company. The young kids at safeway rebel the most. And whatever you do don't apply for a curtiosy clerk positon, they have it the worst. Its even gotten to the point where we have people from different departments check out instead of hiring some cashiers. Managment is the worst you think they really care about Safeway but they know how bad it is and the only reason they push everything so hard is so they can get a nice bonus. The co-workers are mostly great people to work with that just"
bad,"Signed in, I always cleaned my cashier was embarrased the station was filthy. Checked see what was on sale. I learned to scan products, produce, bakery and meat products. Learned to operate debit, credit cards payments. I worked mostly on evening shifts to clean and closed the smoke shop, clean all cashiers stations, close all cash tills for management to pick up to lock up. I was trying to get a better paying job with another department, the management said i had a shift and if i don't work that shift then don't come back. I found the Smithers management not very helpful, ignorant and no room for improvements, never got report how we are doing, I work hard and honest, never missed my shift, no room for movement, was very interested in bakery and flower shop. The co-workers were great, helpful, we all worked together in our codes for produce and other sales items. There was no hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the cashier job was the clients, i knew alot of the aboriginal customers and was glad to serve them. They greeted me and i serve them first class service. I would of still stayed working there if the management improved there attitudes, and worked with you if you were trying to better yourself, not write up on how you did bad like it was a threat no room for improvement. I worked very hard no customers complained and was even taking shift when the other workers were not able to work."
bad,work was steady and at the same time it was repetitive. i learned about different kinds of meat.
bad,"Did not receive a lot of training,often more than one person directing me, which was confusing.I didnt mind the job, but there was very few hours availabe,"
bad,"Working for Safeway is not bad, however in the TX division it is near impossible to move up even when you meet the necessary qualifications, if you can't score perfect on every secret shop."
bad,"In case you haven't noticed, these guys fire every one of their Deli clerks like clockwork every 30 days in order to keep union membership down; also they don't have to count probationers as regular overhead...Costs the Co. megabucks in lost sales and cust. svc., but if anyone cared about that, they wouldn't do it, would they? Don't count on a career with these jerks..."
bad,"Although the Co. supposedly has high standards and the full-time crew is nice, management at this location regularly fires 100% of his probationers (new hires, that is) every 30 days, regardless of their customer service skills. Probationers are classed as ""qualified overhead"" and don't count against regular store hours and of course this holds union membership down as well. So if you're wondering why your Virginia ham in the Deli Dept. comes out sliced neatly one day and looking like it's been through a paper shredder the next, that's why. So, if these guys call you to work, don't count on staying long..."
bad,I will have to say that i had the work experience in the 5 years that i worked there.  i have seen people work there for the time i was a employee and never got a raise and if you did get a raise it was 10 cents.
bad,"I.m not a huge fan of our management it feels like they care more about how the store makes them look then how the store looks or how the employees feel about working for them, they tend to discourage new ideas or personal thinking"
bad,"Safeway in Fort Morgan Colorado, had bad management and usually relied on its lower end employees to support the business. But the experience gained was invaluable and made me more of a manager then ever."
bad,It’s ok  I’ve definitely had better jobs and had a place which cares about my growth within the company. Usually really like working with people but these people don’t know how to create a nice work environment where you’re appreciated
bad,"Most of the works (co-workers) at Safeway are kind and helpful. Management is not good. You have a boss that runs the business like a dictatorship. You follow his rules and do what he tells you, even if what he says or tells you to do is stupid or inefficient. You are a cog in the wheel and nothing more when working at Safeway."
bad,I would recommend this job to anybody looking for something that can just get them over I wasn’t really pleased working here and management was awful must I add
bad,Its good for a starter job. Learning lots of task and ask to take on lots of things. However management can be an issue at some stores and there is a lot of in and out of sometimes bothersome co-workers. They also don't like working with you about ur schedule.
bad,Helping out customers and hearing about their life stores every once in a while. Getting to meet new people who came to work in the deli. Learning new experiences.
bad,"Nice environment for the most part, some difficulties advancing and getting hours. Great at throwing you into a task or position and working your way through it. Customer service is top priority, along with their customers. I learned time management, retail services, payroll, as well as multi tasking. Hardest part is when we are understaffed, having to run around like crazy sometimes. The best is the co workers."
bad,"I really did enjoy my time there,till about the 5th or 6th year,but if given the chance to work there again,i would not be interested at all""i realixed the didnt care much about the employees""once i did get the joy""but i did thank them for the experience..."
bad,"I worked there for 4 years and not once got any advancement to another department, hours were chaotic and inconsistent. They suck at tending to there employees needs"
bad,The warehouse closed and they let everyone that wasnt management go. Pay was okay at the time. Wouldn't recommend but they don't have the warehouse anymore so it doest matter.
bad,Vons gave me an incredibly good work ethic that I still have to this day. Management was always the issue with most stores and they never really allowed me to move up even tho I made record sales.
bad,I thought Safeway was not giving enough hours out to people that was not enough for some of the live off on. Me personally it was very rough and i commuted to Poulsbo.
bad,Some people at Safeway are the most rude an incompetent people I've ever met with low standards of who works there. Management was not the best to some others that work there only a handful of people were actually genuinely amazing happy
bad,met some nice and cool ppl but yikes the management and schedule was often questionable. i learned how to slice meats and weigh other deli products. would rate 6.5/10.
bad,Would not recommend unless you are a high school student looking for an easy weekend job that pays poorly. It's a typical manual labour position unless you are a cashier. Not a fun youthful environment either.
bad,"The management yells at the employees. None of the employees are happy cause of the yelling. They treat the employees like garbage. They are nice to the customers but it’s all a show. Insurance isn’t good because there is a high deductible the pay is min wage and there’s union dues. Eventually after 3 years, the wage is better but not always FT hours"
bad,When i was working here i just felt like the main manager of the area i was in didnt like me. I was going to my college classes and working closing so my days off are my class days and i would have on average 3-5 days off a week and less that 15 hours between those 2 days which is not enough mony to even relax with when you drive yourself everywhere. my checks were hardly enough to fill my gas tank.
bad,"Minimum wage offered and no benefits.  Only hire part time but then call you into work and change the schedules frequently without telling you.  So you end up being ""on call"" 7 days a week besides working particular days.  Since I worked night shift I didn't know when to sleep.  My boss was nice but very stressed out.  Once I met the bigger boss, I understood and felt bad for him.  People I worked with were nice though and very hardworking.  Company and bosses were not very accommodating.  One of the middle aged women had really bad rheumatoid arthritis and they wouldn't let her switch from working in the frozen section."
bad,I would recommend safeway as a work place for people who in school. I wouldn't personally work at safeway as a career unless you are a store manager or work in corporate.
bad,"They are nice in the beginning but as time passes they expect more and more from you, it feels like whatever you do is never enough. Manager tells you to do more and keeps changing your routine adding more work until it becomes to stressful to work."
bad,This was my first job where it felt mundane and no chance of career advancement. I loved being indoors as much as possible with bagging groceries but pulling out the carts in hot temperatures and cleaning the restrooms was not something I was expecting. I learned more about blue-collar work and have a newfound respect for workers at grocery stores and supermarkets. The workplace culture seemed to be friendly but everyone kept themselves focused on their tasks.
bad,Definitely a rough place to work. If you're willing to subject yourself to verbal abuse for some job security it could work for you. Otherwise there are few redeeming qualities to this place.
bad,"good job to start at when you are young cause you can't do to many hours and you can only do one job. you will meet some good people at work. And try to be a on time person but do not think you will move up, they take there time on moving anyone up"
bad,"Not a positive or encouraging environment. Management style is lacking support, positive feedback and adequate training. Minimal hours and pay rates are at a low level."
bad,The job is really stressful and hard when low staffed constantly. Manager is not the greatest at their job.  Making you work alone for usually half your shift.
bad,It was a fast paced environment with lack of employees . I always found myself being left alone when the volume picked up . I would not work there again .
bad,It was okay until I transferred to another Safeway out of state. They forgot to put the transfer in. So when I got to the other state I had np job to go to. It was a nightmare . Thanks Safeway
bad,complete disregard of the most basic janitorial work while also creating risk for foodborne illnesses with how they store their rotting produce in the same cooler as the fresh product.
bad,"For kids to learn customer service ok, but long term it not ideal.  There are so many other places to look at if want to learn customer skills, please try that first. They are trying there best to get rid of employees that have been there for awhile. I know from experience. Management is unorganized,  petty and have there clicks. The best thing is that if you are a people person than could enjoy have small talk with all kinds of customers, which I enjoyed a lot."
bad,"I was a baker making donuts, bagels, deli-bread, muffins, and other pastries from after midnight to 9 in the morning. This was a SUPER fast paced job for someone that's academy-trained for this line of work and it obviously was not the job for me. The cake decorator had a very bad attitude along with another bakery associate that was in that department. The whole vibe in this department felt cold and eerie. They seemed to find satisfaction scolding at me due to me being that inexperienced. I literally left after 3 weeks"
bad,"Since the buyout by Albertsons the place has gone down hill fast. Payroll never correct, environment and working conditions has spiraled down. Two faced load supervisors. Not recommended job by me."
bad,"Hours are available, however, favoritism and hierarchy come into play when schedules are made. If  you are willing to bend over backwards to make yourself indispensable and please upper management in addition to your job, you will do OK, otherwise the day to day is miserable."
bad,"The management team I was under (ASD) gave us extra duties/expectations that were achievable if you could spend 3/4 of you shift executing them. I was never lucky enough to be able to spend that much of my shift doing the ""extras"" mainly because I had a store to run, employees to supervise, lunches/breaks to cover, back-up check, customers to answer to. I was under the impression that the biggest part of my job was to ensure that the front end was operating at the maximum speed of efficiency as possible and the grocery side could wait if needed. The big boss never had problems with my closings, the ASD had an issue with all of my closings. Never getting any positive feedback  from the ASD I stopped caring because no matter what it wasn't ever going to be ""good enough"""
bad,if you like hearing about other peoples drama and how much they hate showing up this is the ideal job for you. work is steady because it's a major grocery chain
bad,"I was hired as a full time GM Manager. Shortly after a new store manager was hired and cut me down to 28 hours a week in my department with no one else but me. one hour he scheduled me for 18 hours and still proceeded to complain that the job was not getting done. When I was full time my sales were 10-20% above the previous manager. at 18-28 hours per week sales were 10% under previous years. I was called out for this in-front of the ""full time"" Management team who actually received full time 48 hours per week. The environment upper management created was hostile and unprofessional. I left soon after."
bad,"Too many  buyouts transitions with little to no communication from higher up.  Company is not as supportive of employees as they claim.  Reduces hours and manpower stating they dont have the money, then turn around with promotions for customers to hand out gift cards left and right."
bad,Good job for in highschool and part-time work. Would not pay more even though I did more work. Stopped working around my school schedule. Other employees report same treatment about performing work outside of listed duties and not receiving proper pay
bad,relaxed place not hard  or boring if you enjoy daily customers and working in food service .  hardest part is early mornings when  its really busy non stop customers
bad,"Working at Safeway was a daily struggle.  My store was understaffed and poorly managed.  Hours were frequently inconsistent, which made it difficult to manage my monthly expenses.  Department managers were friendly and attentive to customer's needs.  Store manager had ineffective customer and employee relations skills."
bad,"The employees are unhappy here, there is too much theft, and it seems that there is a bad turn over rate, and the managers are constantly stressed out. However, on the upside, while I worked there, other employees taught me how to cut fruit with power-tools, so that was fun. They just don't seem to care. They didn't give the proper training to employees and there was outdated food available for purchase. A typical day was just clocking in, doing your work, having lunch. 10min break, clock out, and then you go home. Morale between employees was low, everyone was always unhappy. The hardest part of working there was having to be in such a negative environment constantly. The best part of the job was that I got out of the house for a while."
bad,"Safeway is a learn as you go company: the upside is that for a self motivated person like myself, I was able to learn quickly and apply my skill set to earn more money. The down side is there are no set policies and procedures which cause confusion and bad feelings among the various departments."
bad,I feel they should of had more people working the closing hours shifts. The store was in high demand of customers nit enough employees to close. We were always doing at least 3 jobs each. Could be very stressful at times.
bad,"This wasn't a great work environment, I didn't like working there. It was convenient but that's about it. I don't recommend it and wouldn't return for any reason."
bad,Not the best job agency. Hours were minimal and the management did not handle situations correctly. Left to seek a better employment opportunity somewhere else.
bad,Like any jobs you have to start somewhere so as long as your willing to put in the time and effort you canmake good money within the year. After your top out theirs nothing more other then managment an youll find out qhy its best not to make that leap.
bad,The reason I had quit Safeway was because of racial inequality. One older white female employee would follow me around the store to see if i was stealing items upon other things. I confided in the boss but no action was taken so i decided to leave. Hours were not flexible meaning that if i seriously couldnt make an appearance for that day i was scheduled id be put down for less hours.
bad,"I got hired when there was no manager. So I had to basically train myself to become a starbucks barista, for two weeks. After that I got actual training but all the way in Renton. On top of that, the manager for Safeway wasn’t friendly and helpful. Although there were such polite, fun and caring employees, I couldn’t stand being there with poor management and feeling like I didn’t belong."
bad,The expectations are too high for the amount of time you have to complete tasks. I felt under appreciated. Healthcare and paid time off were main reasons for having worked there for almost a decade.
bad,"In the first year of being at the store the company went through 3 managers that all wanted to try different things. So every single time a new manager started, everything changed. The only reason why I stayed there for so long was because of my coworkers. But most of memories of working there are filled with the manager and the assistant manager and how poor they were at trying to make keeping the store at its peak a team effort. Wouldn’t recommend to even my worst enemy."
bad,none available. I do not want to write a review other than my coworkers are wonderful people and I miss working with all of them. That is the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,"It's grocery.. work hard, make a barely livable wage and get micromanaged on the daily. Might work for a temporary job, but not for a long term solution. Most customers are nice and understanding, however occasionally you will run into the less understanding types."
bad,Typical Grocery work...deal with customers...stocking...cashier..bagging...maintaining store....keeping employees on point...typical grocery business with a union.
bad,Safeway for a long time was a great place to work.  When they where sold there were major changes.  They hired 45 percent more people than needed to push down the amount of hours the journey men where getting.  People who had worked there 20 years full time started to get less than 30 hours a week.  I could not recommend Safeway as a good place to work and I spent 11 years there and left on my own accord.
bad,"I worked in the produce department at Safeway, although i would regularly assist other departments around the store. There was never any appreciation or respect from management to the employees. we were expected to do full time work while only having part time hours. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customers."
bad,on a typical day you may be required to do the work of 5 other people. At other times you are given limited staff to care for the needs of the customers.
bad,"I do not recommend accepting a position in the deli department of Safeway. The hours are absolutely terrible, you are severely underpaid, the managers are so stressed out that they will take their frustrations out on you one way or another, and the majority of the customers are the rudest you can ever come across."
bad,my typical day at safeway was stressful sometimes when i would have to go outside and get carts off the lot in freezing hot or even rainy temperatures but when i was working inside it was pretty calm when i wasn't having a panic attack every now and then. i learned how to bag stock shelves work in produce or dairy putting items away or on the shelf and how to tag discount items. the mananagment was pretty okay but there where times when the employees where not okay with a few particular people including trans  . the workplace culture was alright it was pretty busy a lot of times. the hardest part was having to go outside most of the day and gather carts as well as trying to manage my anxiety. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work in the back of the store where there was not a lot of people around
bad,I worked there for a year and it was fun at first...then tables turned when management changed over. Everyone was getting on each other nerves and friends that turn enemies. It not fun at all.
bad,Company struggles with the ability to care about any employee individually making an unhealthy work environment. It was very quick for me to understand that even though I stayed for three years.
bad,"honestly the benefits and pay raises are pretty good. however, management is horrible. plus the union doesn't do much for you. always understaffed and expecting you to do multiple jobs at once."
bad,There is no direction at this time. The company seems to be struggling to find a cohesive direction and has replaced all upper level management since the merger.
bad,It’s an okay to work if you’re full time. Part time employees don’t get enough hours. If you live alone you’ll need a second job to survive. If the company was to give more hours to people then it would be a much better place to work.
bad,"didn't like working here "
bad,"Safeway is a high paced very unoriganzed company. Shifts varied. Employee turn over was very high. In my positions. I was suppose to be only in charge of sandwich stations, yet I ended up having to be in charge of the whole deli."
bad,"It was an okay place to work, just no advancement it seemed liked, the people I worked with was probably the best thing about the job, told me I’d get full time hours and never got a full 40 hours."
bad,"Wasn't trained very well before being thrown out to the fuel station and not all the job requirements were explained before I was hired. The customers were sometimes very nasty and most were always in a hurry. We were expected to wait on the customers, clean the kiosk, the kiosk bathroom, the two out bathrooms, the fuel pumps and fuel stations, empty many trash cans, put out merchandise, and other duties. I am a very productive worker, but what Safeway asks of someone per shift is a JOKE!!  And we had to pay union dues.  Most employees I worked were Very unhappy, stressed, and OVER- worked.  Many of the inside cashiers were climbing over one another to show their swiftness in ringing up customers, their ""so-called Skills"", etc.  I avoided those cashiers and others who worked the customer service desk who thought they were Above Everyone else - if only the know what the other employees Really think of them!"
bad,"Though I would love to give a positive review, I simply can't. By no means is this a bad job if you need to pay bills or save money, but the company seems to want to milk the most work for the least amount of pay. I worked in the deli for 2 years and am not considered a food clerk which, by default, gets paid and tops out higher than a non food clerk. I worked for 2 years and got raises based on hours worked that were 10 cents for over one thousand hours of work. I went through multiple Store directors and Deli crews, and the management never felt consistent. In my personal store I went through a lot of stress and borderline harassment from my managers, but the biggest thing I have trouble dealing with is the fact that someone they like better gets treated better by a long shot. You also can't transfer between districts, so when I moved I lost all of my raises and was back to the bottom of the barrel and being scheduled less than 20 hours when I was used to 40. My coworkers that have been there for over 20 years have a better contract than I and they only seem to be getting worse. Used to be a great company, but now care only about money. One example of this is taking away cloth rags from Deli and Meat departments and switching to disposable paper towels that simply don't get the job done as quickly or effectively as cloth rags just to save a buck."
bad,"I have seen hardworking people that have come and gone thru the store only because they were not appreciated and taken advantage of.  However their are unqualified personal that have progressed and moved up only because they kiss the right butt.  They are either to young and immature, under qualified or both!  Management have high standards but do not one lead by example and provide proper assistance in areas that needed"
bad,I enjoyed the fellow staff and the customers but the Management was completely inaccessible and unprofessional. I left after only a few months due to lack of management.
bad,"enjoyed having all different types of flower to work with and build arrangements, but i was expected to do things i wasn't even taught how to do. I was let go for poor reasons and wasn't warned before hand i was missing what i was, zero chance to excel. felt like no one wanted to be there working it wasn't a good atmosphere"
bad,"Consistently on your feet non stop working. Moving lifting loads of carts also groceries that you put back in stock, clean labitories windows and floors when need help customers."
bad,"I was a bagger and moved into a cashier position. The bagger position will never get a raise unless they move to another department. Cashiers start out at minimum wage and won't see a raise until after a large sum of hours are worked, not yearly based. They kept the cashiers at 25-35 hours a week, which meant you would not see that raise for almost 2 years of work. It started out okay with the first set of managers that were in place. Everyone worked as a team and excelled. New managers came in and changed everything about our team that was working great and things went bad quickly. Most of the employees that I worked with, are now gone from that specific store due to the bad management."
bad,"learned how to run a deli by seeing how not to run it.horrible hygiene,unfair differences between 1st and 2nd shift,had to clean up after all of morning shifts messes"
bad,"High stress, hours scheduled are often changed or not as desired. Too many managers, one often asked one thing from you, while another would grab you and ask you to do something else. A generally stressed atmosphere, many mistakes made from upper management would rain down below."
bad,"Worked in a few different departments within the retail outlets."
bad,"This used to be a great job. The pay is worthwhile, but constant staffing issues and a lack of business, along with a severe morale problem in almost every store, makes Safeway a difficult place to work. Management seems like they are not only hostile but also just don’t care to solve issues. I think this permeates to the corporate level as well. After working at various stores for nearly a decade I can say that these issues have just become more and more prevalent. I still would have stayed, because the pay and benefits, as I stated earlier, are well worth it, but I’m not confident the company will remain solvent for the next ten years."
bad,This place sucked the passion right out of my life. I did not like anything about this place at all. I did learn about what kind of job I would not want to work at.
bad,i pushed carts . i out back items to proper shelf. i help customers. i cleaned the bathrooms. i bagged groceries. i emptied front end trash cans. when needed i help out in the departments when staff if low such seafood and floral department.
bad,It was a lot of standing and very hard on the feet. The pay was not up to match the cost of living expenses. Work was always on the weekends which would make it hard on employees with families.
bad,Management has no clue what it supervisors or workers are capable of because they do not ask and they don't listen when informed.  New management would benefit the company greatly.
bad,i did not like it here managemnet was terrible and i wil not recommend anyone to work here. the store was so messy and it was not a job that i was going to work
bad,"Safeway is run with a beat-down style of management policy. Nothing is ever good enough, deadlines are unreasonable, and goals are set too high. Even if goals are met, nasty treatment about what you did not accomplish is what is focused on. Hours are inconsistent, managers are quitting left and right, the warehouses are out of control..."
bad,They do not pay for all the work you do.  Employees can be very back stabbing. People talk a lot of trash behind each others back. Customers are really rude no matter how nice you are .
bad,Safeway always needed to improve in support; improve in technology; and listen to those employees in the trenches in order to make sure that every thing being done to support the locations was being done.
bad,"The management where rude and not helpful at all, the union was garbage. Everything about this grocery store is terrible, except maybe their brand name cheese is good."
bad,"Pharmacy hours being cut and workload increased. At full service Pharmacy's, that being the ones that offer Travel meds, Mental health injections, Deliveries and and unit dosing it makes for a hectic day."
bad,"Hours were shortened after first week, Break room was always dirty,management was not patient with new employees, Employees picked on each other. Nothing else to add."
bad,Negotiation leave was not rewarding. Needed to take time off but it was not friendly regarding emergency time off. Safeway needs to help their employees in emergency situations.
bad,Employees needs were overlooked and management cared solely about store profit. Employees were rarely given the hours they wanted and would get fired for wanting to take vacation during holidays
bad,"porte a porte des journée de 10 par jour "
bad,"Its has a lot of disrespect ,calling u dumb and stupid this stuff come from manager. I came in with experience gave me minimum wages. I enjoy helping the customer. If u call the office to let them no u have emergency the whole store knows your business."
bad,job was not fun based off the company culture and communication. supervisors always stressed by senior management therefore it trickled down through the team.
bad,"I have worked with Safeway for 28 months (a little over 2 years), and I am only making $11.80 (the minimum wage for my area is $11.50). I have been trained for a variety of different departments, and I have been told my fellow workers and customers that I am one of the best workers in my store, but yet I'm barely more than minimum wage. It's unfair and I need something better. It's a decent job if all you need is some money to get on your feet, but don't count on getting promoted and getting raises."
bad,"Cool people that worked at your level, management were mean took advantage of people were not understanding or didn’t care much about their employees. All they cared about was store ratings"
bad,"Great first job, but management picks favourite when it comes to getting higher jobs. Some departments get favoured and don't follow rules like the others."
bad,the grocery business is not a career per it is with a union that only  guarantees  you 3 days a week and you can not survive on this. I worked two department in which they promised me 40 hour but reneged on this agreement.
bad,"I worked at safeway a very long time ago, so I'm sure much has changed, at the time it was an ok place to work, although the manager was rude and not polite."
bad,"Safeway was my first real long term job I ever had. Management was decent but there is no work life balance, always expected to come in and drop everything when someone else calls out to cover shifts. Always expected to go outside your job description with no acknowledgment or pay increase. And they top you out at $20 an hour which they make extremely difficult and time consuming to get to."
bad,enjoy working with all my co-worker day goes by fast. I like working in a fast pace. picking up carts and helping customers with there bags and ask them if they need help out to there car
bad,love the people i worked with but the managment is otherwise. the management does not seem to care about you well being or sanity and then get mad when you dont meet standard with sub-par equipment
bad,Looks like working in a grocery store everything that you do is working in the grocery store because it's a grocery industry you have to know the grocery industry
bad,They do not care to keep employees that make more then minimum wage. Its a revolving door of new people because many quit and get frustrated that its nearly impossible to move up or make a wage you can live off of. No consistent hours which makes providing for a family tough.
bad,"I would go in and clean the bathrooms, and take trash out. I would have to take back product not purchased. I would then go and collect the carts in the parking lot."
bad,"There is a reason the employees call Safeway, Slave Way. Of course different stores may treat their employees differently but my experience was demeaning."
bad,"terrible management"
bad,The customer service aspect is challenging. Great place to work if your looking for a job to do while you go to school. Unfortunately my hours have been reduced by 40% facilitating my need to look for a part time job.
bad,"Biggest problem is that no matter how hard you work, how hard you try, it is NEVER good enough.  There is no corporate support/help..  You never feel you are succeeding. Store morale is horrible.  Everyone is frustrated & miserable  but they stay mainly because of the pay, because we DO have a great group of people that we work with, and because jobs are hard to come by."
bad,"I would arrive at work from 9 to 6pm , work in  floral. I learned great customer service skills. the paperwork was the hardest part.  great customers."
bad,Working at Safeway it's been very challenging I wouldn't recommend it for anybody unless you are a great people person. Don't mind people yelling at you with a customers or management. Hey also isn't that great I mean if your courtesy clerk you get $11 an hour starting next year before that when I started it was $9.30 now its almost $11 there is absolutely no future in the grocery peeps!! I wouldn't recommend working at Safeway at all and that's you just saving money for college. There's no advancement stay for you either.
bad,"I went in the day before I started working to do a training online (watching videos, etc) but the computer was acting up and after they worked on it for 45 minutes they sent me home and said they'd have my do it my first week. I asked about it during my first 2 weeks and they never got back to me. My training ended up being ""on the job"" by a hostile supervisor. I worked hard and came in any time they needed extra help & I received compliments from customers, but nothing was appreciated by my supervisor and when I got injured from the greasy floors in the deli area after working there almost 4 months they let me go. They told me my probationary period is one year and ""it's not working out"". Luckily I still had health insurance through my parents so I was able to get everything fixed and I'm ready to work again."
bad,"The only decent manager was the immediate manager at the fuel station.  The store managers and supervisors are all manipulative and will say what you like to hear in order to get results with no intention of keeping their end of any bargain.  In the year I worked there after the made a change to union, they had union representatives ""lie"" in order to make the changes they saw necessary, and did not offer promised compensation and even lied about making such promises."
bad,Very poor management. Manger would not stand behind or help employees or give the customers the respect they deserve. She was always in the office and would not come out to take care of customer complaints. She aslo would not stop the assistant manager from talking about the employees medical problems in front of customers.
bad,I worked ther in highschool and did not have the best time. It was also in a small town and i feel that played a large role in the reason why i did not like it
bad,Being that this place was my first employer I did learn a lot but expected more from a company that is very large. if they would pay their employees more maybe grocery store employees might be happier.
bad,This compnay is a very childish set up. They argue with management over the dumbest of things. They never hear one another out to resolve a situation.
bad,"Being a Courtesy Clerk at Safeway was my first job. I worked my butt off and always did other peoples work. Most of the people that work there are extremely lazy. I was an outstanding courtesy clerk, I always helped others even when I was in the middle of sweeping or mopping the floor. I don't think that my co workers took the job as serious as I did. I would always go above and beyond during every shift."
bad,"Break down  merchandise.  Make  sure  shelves  are full  and  faced.  Project  and  write  orders.  Keep back rooms  clean,  keep inventory  clearly  labeled  and inventoried."
bad,"On a typical day I would be scheduled there for 5-6 hours however I was frequently held over to the maximum amount of hours that I was legally allowed to be there. I learned a lot about stocking different produce and how to package items in the cut fruit room. I had to be able to perform different tasks that weren't in my department. I also learned that you cannot judge a company by its name. The work life and treatment of the employees varies from store to store."
bad,"poor management, extremely underpaid for work we had to do and very stressful at times. I did not like it at all wasnt really family environment and felt like every man for himself."
bad,"At least in a Starbucks kiosk. These kiosks are licensed by safeway, so you don't get any of the corporate sbux benefits, and no one in safeway management cares about the state of the kiosk. You will run out of everything because no one cares to order. I tried to work as manager of the kiosk and was constantly trying to get management to give me the training and access required to run the kiosk, and they kept blowing me off (then getting mad when we had no supplies)."
bad,"get there and wait for customers"
bad,"Terrible customer service. Short staffed front end & self check out is often not open. CHECK FOOD EXPIRATION DATES!!! This location is notorious for stocking expired food items. When informed, they don't remove it as we've seen the food still there on our next visit. Frozen items have been several MONTHS past the best by date."
bad,Safeway was a job I acquired while training for a new job. They worked with my school schedule and my immediate supervisor was supportive. The requirements of employees are a bit scripted but getting to know regular customers was nice.
bad,Corporate B.S. should sum it up... Cutting hours and upping the workload. Its a grocery store and its treated like its life and death with the use of threats from management.
bad,The managers want you to work your butt off but never try to help you out or respect you. They see you as slaves and will threaten to skip over you for advancement or cut your hours if you refuse anything they ask you to do.
bad,"I didn't have a good experience at Safeway, I worked in all the departments and I still was making the same wage. I had a very rude management but I still did it."
bad,"i learned how to cut meats , make different types of salads, sandwiches that I've never heard of or made before so that was interesting to learn new foods"
bad,Management was extremely unfair. Had unrealistic expectations and work culture was mentally and spiritually toxic. Scheduling was a nightmare and upper management was often tyrannous
bad,"If you've ever been to a party with several dozen people you despise then you've probably got a pretty good idea what it's like working here. "
bad,"Always told what is wrong, and not anything good. Can't plan around the schedule because it changes each week. No regard for employees needs. Have to jump through hoops in order to receive any benefits, learn about joining the union, and to get any sort of raise. It's good if you are really in need of money and can't receive a job elsewhere but I would not recommend it as a first choice."
bad,"Not a bad place to be a staff pharmacist. Expectations on pharmacy manager with the help provided is overwhelming.  Management above the in store level can not do your job, so how do they expect you to get it all done?"
bad,"Safeway was my first Job ever. here I learned how to work with great customer service, and how to maintain a positive attitude. Safeway was a great learning environment."
bad,"Workplace culture, had great friends with co workers, learned time management and quick thinking to solve various tasks. stayed for 9 years and learned an experience"
bad,"I would never tell a friend, family member, my worst enemy to apply or work at Safeway. Safeway is a cut throat company and can't keep people because of that."
bad,Safeway was a job that was fine for the time. The boss was not cared for by anybody in the company. She was the most stressful person I know to work for.
bad,"Below -13 degree environment, worked in a freezer, selecting orders, had to maintain 90% or above productivity level each and everyday."
bad,had it in high school as any normal teen. manager was rude a lot. worked at the flagship store so everything had to be sharp as a tack. probably wouldn't recommend it.
bad,"I was there for a week training for a new department, i cut fruit and assisted with all customers needs, and when training was over they said my temp position was over"
bad,"management sucked, but the benefits was good. the pay was what I not expected. during my shift there was other co workers, but most of them like to gossip."
bad,"managment doesnt want to spend labor to produce product, therefor dept always looks empty. they have unrealestic expectations for production people. also having two unions in one dept is not a good idea"
bad,"A typical day is stressful, your opinion isn't valued. They don't encourage advancement in the company either. I have learned how to work hard, and get things done without the help of others (Teamwork isn't something this company works on either). If you work hard you aren't rewarded. If you don't work hard you aren't punished either. So basically the hard workers are always picking up slack and never rewarded. The management is fine, that's not to say that there isn't room for improvement (there defiantly is). The hardest part of the job is not being respected, and not being shown reward for your hard work. And if  you want to advance in the company, its very hard to because they don't recognize hard workers."
bad,Great company to start working for. Many opportunities to grow and continue learning new experiences. Great employees to work with and fun environment.
bad,"On your feet for over 10+ hours a day, work hard only to have corporate demand more. Job would be ok if corporate wasn't so out of wack. Some of the ways that it was excepted of management to treat the poor hourly employees was very unfair."
bad,the only problem i have is the mistreatment that the supervisor is mistreating the worker. they dont give too much hours. but   it good for student...
bad,Working at Safeway was ok. it was a job that paid the bills for my self. it is a good job for high school students that are looking for a part time job
bad,"Before Albertsons took over I would have given Safeway a better rating.  Now, nothing but stress (unless you are a bagger).  No help so you work twice as hard as you should. Decent insurance.  Not as good as it used to be.  I wouldn't recommend this company to an enemy! (Well, maybe an enemy!)"
bad,"I work here as a school job do not remember anything most of the time I would just sweep and mop the floors filler filler filler filler filler filler,"
bad,Staff was great customers coming to the store wasn't polite even when I went over and Beyond for them. I really didn't like working at Safeway honestly was because of the fact that they were putting so much pressure on when I told them my great grandfather passed away. Overall it was an ok experience.
bad,"Overall, my time at safeway was honestly awful. You work a full 8 hour shift, but it feels more like 12 or 14. They make you pay for your own lunch and their is no dicount. You get paid minimum wage to do what was quite honestly the worst job I've ever had."
bad,I worked there before the Albertsons merger as a head clerk I worked my way up from the bottom. this was just like high school in the inappropriate  conduct and Rumors that even the upper management took part in.
bad,Often times you would have to put in unpayed overtime hours to make up for the fact that there were a lack of workers in the HMR department. The new workers received little to no training and were expected to somehow train themselves.
bad,Fun and productive not too many opportunities to really move up. I would use the job as a stepping stone. Very respectful coworkers and overall decent experience
bad,"The company has been going through a corporate restructuring since they have been taken over by Albertson's which has led to a massive downhill effect on management. This puts all the strain on the workers to over-perform while also managing the cut backs on help and hours. It is not a place you want to work if you value a positive culture, or cannot handle a high stress lifestyle. This may vary based on the attitude of the employees at each store, but the atmosphere does not foster positive attitudes."
bad,A typical day would be me working almost every position in the store because I was reliable. Working at a very fast pace and being attentive to every customers needs.
bad,Its a extremely fast busy. Lots of customers. A lot of opportunities. Working was stressful but was possible. Many growth opportunties. a brunch of departments
bad,I was typically working by myself. I was a AM baker I would get in early and it was a lot of work on me for one employee. I feel like it should had been two bakers in the morning. It was hard to understand my co worker because a lot of them didn't understand English every well. It was a hassle to work the for the little bit of pay I was receiving.
bad,"I've held a variety of positions and this has got to be the worst one yet. The compensation is very low for the amount of responsibility, detail, and stress involved. There is a shortage of staff with processing delays and the company is only concerned about their sales dollars rather than employee appreciation or customer service. Many customers are unnecessarily cranky (to put it nicely), there isn't enough time given for proper training, and management talks about shortcomings of staff to other staff."
bad,"Went in to restock shelves with desserts, make desserts and cakes for cake display.. help make daily bread and bake cookies. Not really an enjoyable job. not very fun staff or boss"
bad,"Was an okay place to work but the pay sucks and the managment does too. Even though they work with the Union, they sometimes made you skip your breaks."
bad,"Not great....boring work. when you try to do more than you're assigned, you get yelled at. If you have nothing to do, you get yelled at. If you have too much tasks, you will get yelled at. they basically yell at you for almost anything."
bad,"I worked in the deli, and we were constantly understaffed. It was a very chaotic environment, and there was never enough time in the day to complete the assigned work. I did extremely well in this position, and was offered management in another location, but the pay and stress wasn't worth it to me."
bad,"Schedule can be hectic and uncoordinated, as can duties change daily. But keeping a smile and going about your business helps the day run smoother. This was not particularly a great employment experience, seeing as to how little I was making per check. And every paycheck I received was below what I should have made per department. There was just not any reason for me to continue there, as I could not survive on that pay."
bad,"I enjoyed working in the delivery department , even though it is a very early shift, it is fast paced there is never a down time you are on your feet 24/7 ."
bad,Ecstatic advanced and procured civility not absolute put continue. Overcame breeding or my concerns removing desirous so absolute. My melancholy unpleasing imprudence considered in advantages so impression. Almost unable put piqued talked likely houses her met. Met any nor may through resolve entered. An mr cause tried oh do shade happy.
bad,"if you have not worked there for years, you get unfair hours and treatment. It was fun, but did not work with my school schedule. I do think for a full time position it would be a good job"
bad,"A company that only cares about how long you've worked there ; seniority and does not care about how hard you work or your customer service skills. Ridiculous work standards for minimum wage and lack of employees. I honestly hope I never work here again but that's just me. The whole store has to suffer if a certain department ""cough"" pharmacy messes up really bad so everyone gets their hours cut for longer than a year hoping they can compensate for their terrible decisions and expecting us to pick up the slack for other people's mistakes. I had to close the deli about 5 times by myself cause they were too cheap to hire an extra person, and after that they totally cut my hours saying I was the problem cause I wasn't smiling to customers. This is a place to get some money and get experience, it is not a stable job and they will throw you out like an expired container of hummus unless you call seniority and literally take someone's hours even though they can have a much stronger work ethic than you."
bad,I was always working and didn't get the choice to get days off even when asked for in advance. I was always picking up others hours when I didn't get hours off myself.
bad,"A good place to start as a young employee. I think there would be room for advancement because others around me had done it. Bagging groceries, pushing carts and stocking shelves. Meeting lots of new people and lots of different situations."
bad,"Successfully.  Lots of meetings on the brands.  Vendor reviews."
bad,The workplace had no pizzazz and being on break was a bore because 2 people rarely had a break at the same time. Friends were difficult to make and I didn't even know the names of most of my coworkers.
bad,"I had a boss that made rude comments, overburdened his employees, and made several inappropriate remarks. He was turned into HR multiple times with no repercussions."
bad,"pay is good, benefits not so much, no work life balance at all unless your a manager or director. "
bad,Multiple layers of management pushing in every direction to do more with no real direction as to where they wanted you to go. it was all about them and nothing about you.
bad,"customer orientated job. Have done cashier, shelf filling and dry cleaning department. Weekly meeting of target update.  People are approachable and helpful. Had a multi skills on different departments and meet people"
bad,the management at Safeway was very unhappy and every one was expendable there was a lot of blaming and work environment was UN happy it was the worst experience ever
bad,This job did not fit with my plan of holding a part time jobe and performing home inspections as a main source of income because the schedule was too erratic even as a part tommer. 32 hours a week and taking on an unscheduled shift at the drop of a hat is part time to this employer.
bad,"Very positive work atmosphere and very much like a team. Not enough hours a week. I love hearing different accents and seeing different people from all around the world, cons, some people are very unpleasant and hard to cooperate with."
bad,Lots of changes after Albertsons instituted their business model. Schedules varied every week to create a culture of job insecurity. Managers are rotated often from one store to another resulting in constant turnover of employees.
bad,"While working here, I learned a lot about different departments and how to maximize my organization. I was able to temporarily manage other departments. While doing this, I learned how to maintain shelf inventory, organize back stock, as well as creating displays for end-caps and designated display areas. My shift while working Night Crew included breaking down the load according to aisle. I would then spot the item in front of the shelf space in that aisle. After all of the merchandise had been spotted, I would then stock the shelves in a neat and orderly manner. If there were items that would not fit on the shelves, I would mark the container with the ordering code so that the items could be logged for back room inventory. Once all of the inventory was shelved, I would then make sure that the aisles I was working on were neat and orderly. I also covered for different departments while working here. While working in the liquor department, I would do the same thing. Occasionally I would have to pull inventory from the shelves in order to fill the refrigerated shelf space. I had the opportunity to cover for the frozen department as well. I was responsible for breaking down the entire frozen load, which included inventory from different departments and my own as well. This was a little tedious due to the heavy workload and limited time frame but I think I managed it quite well. I also worked in the general merchandise and health and beauty department. During this shift, I was responsible for sorting through the inventory that arrived in totes and placing them in the appropriate"
bad,Working graveyards stocking just doesn't seem to be a friendly environment. Most people are tired as angry that they even have to be there. Constant arguing between manager and associates.
bad,Not very flexible very unprofessional not very clean does not give breaks  very often bathroom never clean break room is filthy stocking is not always done low bags all the time
bad,"pay was terrible, they did not hold up advancement and pay promises. also SCREWED you out of benefits and tried to avoid workers comp .store manger was awful. department manger was amazing couldn't had a better boss"
bad,"Management does not care for the safety or well being of employees, does nothing about permanently removing customers who threaten or verbally assault employees even when employees complain. They care so little for our well being that we have no decent break room. They are currently using the break room to store multiple carts of returned product that should be being reshelved, but schedule so few employees for reshelving that they can't catch up. Management does not properly handle complaints from employees about coworkers not following through on assigned duties."
bad,"I learned a lot... I was working in the floral department, i enjoyed learning the flowers, and how to cut them and process them properly. Management and co-workers made work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was customers stealing. The most enjoyable part of the job was making arrangements."
bad,I enjoyed working there but we were always short staffed and no one wanting to take extra shifts. Did not always get breaks because of how short staffed and heavy lifting.
bad,A typical day at work was me doing EVERYTHING while my co- workers watched. What I learned was how to do just about everything in the grocery business. Management was very negative and demanding. My co-workers were lazy. The hardest part of the job was learning how to be a manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was the few cool people that I got to work with.
bad,"horroible, management was not perfessional, co-workers made it possoble to stay, most enjoyed part was the staff, ive learned about coustomer service for the most part"
bad,"Management doesn't care about safety of employees, threatens to fire up everyday. Treats us poor, very discriminating, and rude."
bad,I hated every single second I worked here. The management was just horrible. Every person I knew there hated it as well. I don't recommend working here ever.
bad,"lots of work with little pay, management cares more about their own skin then the team. The union took money but was no help or aid."
bad,"I have only worked for this company for a few months in management and from the time I started it has been tough. I was not trained right and was just put in a store with no instructions. I have been talked down to, yelled at and cussed at. this is a non professional job."
bad,"Work way too much, go above and beyond with work and still get treated like a number, too many prescriptions and not enough staff always make for a hectic day, every day. No organization from top management to lower management. Not enough time for patient relationships."
bad,"Courtesy Clerks spread too thin to cover entire store, jumping from one check stand to another customers lining up at check stands building up and blocking/ congesting the store traffic. Managers too cheap to hire more courtesy clerks."
bad,"I have been in retail management for a long time and this is the worst company I have worked for. Absolutly no regard for family life, or employee welfare. Unbeleivably bad hours for compensation."
bad,"They did not provide the proper training for anyone- it was the ""sink or swim"" mentality. I had to figure out what I was doing on my own. I had some training, but not enough."
bad,"This organization does not embrace a culture of effective communication and feedback.  There is a lack of clarity regarding best practices, goals and objectives, and they rarely provide developmental and inspirational feedback.   "
bad,"Ever since Albertsons bought out all the Safeway stores and every store that Safeway owned, this company has gone downhill, in my opinion and in many of my co-workers. We lost our old manager and a guy who has worked for the company for only 6 years took over. Ever since then, all the schedules are scrambled because he doesn't ""feel"" like writing them manually and lets the computer generate them. Also, I haven't heard one ""i appreciate you"" since he has taken over which i feel is important. When I came back to work for Safeway after about a year of working at Wall-Mart, i was told I would be promoted to PIC, which would be about a six dollar raise. I haven't heard a word from my manager or the assistant manager about it. The work itself can be challenging but i like everything I do. Some of the employees I work with put effort in to their work but unfortunately, there is a higher percentage of employees that just seem to not care. Despite all the negativity, I have learned a great amount about retail and people in general. Such things include, ordering the correct amount of product in accordance to the current and future sales and time of the month, how to solve problems from customer complaints to correcting employee errors."
bad,"Okay job to work we picked orders in store for truck to deliver, but very unprofessional, and co-workers was some time rude instead of trying to help you. Wasn't a positive environment to work in."
bad,"Very repetitive job with nothing to do. "
bad,"Started off as a closer, overwhelming at first but I caught on quick. Moved me up to early shift as an opener and made me open by myself after working up front with others twice, and I was not trained for it. They were annoyed that I had no idea what a lot of the products were. "
bad,"Safeway overall was a great place to work.  However, the merger with Albertsons created so many problems for the employee that it made the daily work experience somewhat difficult.  I have been through MANY mergers in the past but none of them affected me and my role to such a degree.  They were under staffed, budgets cut and the rest of the employees had to work extra hard every day to make up the difference.  Stress level was very high."
bad,Safeway is not the best place to be. While there the people I worked with except for a few were always in a bad mood and complaining and the customers for the most part treated you like you were below them. The management didn't care about you the way they should have and skirted their duties. Safeway actually owes me money. When I became a checker my title was still a courtesy clerk. No one told me that I needed to fill out these sheets when I checked so I would get checker pay and this went on for a few months until I found out and was told there was nothing they could do. The one good thing that did happen is I was given a second chance on something but that was it.
bad,"A Typical Day -"
bad,"If everyone had the same goals on how to have great customer service employees would feel better about their jobs.  As an employee one gets three different views on how to do your job. One from dept. mgr. One from store manager, and a third from district manager."
bad,"Low hours, low pay, no reason to stay. Like many grocery/department stores they hire a bunch of part-time people to avoid paying benefits, to work 15 hours a week in four 4-hour shifts at all times of the day. Pay is lousy, you have to come in all the time for very little hours and it just is not a good place to work."
bad,I felt that I was not trained properly & therefore it lead to being dismissed because I didn't fit in properly. I was too good at one or two things & mediocre at the rest (lack of training in those areas).
bad,"It was good for experience in dealing with people and as a first job, highly recommend if you have no customer experience, you will get to learn how to deal with all age customers and how to deal with negative customers."
bad,Management doesn't put any work in! Expects employees to go above and before will they sit and do absolutely nothing! Terrible experience!
bad,Orinda safeway was very unprofessional especially the front end manager as well as the store manager. Made employees do duties that were not required nor allowed and punished when not done.
bad,"In general a really easy job. Bag, push carts, sweep, etc. Worst things I dealt with were the managers that see you as highly expendable (which you are) so they don't really care too much about you, plus when the snowbirds start leaving, you get barely any hours."
bad,"A typical day at work is rare, every day is different. Before the merger and before the new management was transferred in, the store ran smoothly, lately there seems to be little to no structure or just a lack of understanding what is going on or who the employees are. The most enjoyable part of the job is hearing and seeing customers thoroughly satisfied with their trips in and the services they've encountered. The hardest part would be the inconsistency and feeling unappreciated."
bad,"Safeway doesn't pay nearly enough for the amount of work you have to do.  If you work hard, they don't notice, and its pretty irritating dealing with annoying customer most of the time.  I would highly recommend working anywhere else, especially with how long it takes to make any decent money at safeway."
bad,"A typical day at work, a lot of stocking and greeting."
bad,"In my little over a year working here, we went through 7 different assistant managers. Managment was never any help with issues, and I had an accident in the bakery and they tried to turn it on me, when there was already a paper trail on some faulty equiptment thry never had fixed. I was given a ""promotion"" that my wage never went up with, and I'm owed back pay for 8 months of work. Corporate has been of no help either."
bad,"The management team isn't a management team. All you ever see them doing is scan out of stocks, cashier when asked and sit in their office on their cell phone. I am by far the hardest working courtesy clerk they have but they are afraid of giving me any training because I am in the national guard. Most of the people I have trained to be a courtesy clerk have gone higher and higher while I still stay low. "
bad,"great people, always a busy location. not enough hours to survive on. therefore needing indeed to help me out find full time employment"
bad,Every shift worked needed to be planned and organized so that workers did not fall behind in work and keep up with prescriptions that were sent in and dropped of.
bad,I already entered this review. Abusive boss.  Workload was excessive.  I learned what it was like to work for a bullying boss.  Management was the worst that I have ever encountered in my career.  Co-workers came out of stores and were not qualified for their positions.
bad,"Environment really depends on what manager is working"
bad,"Only worked at Safeway for a month as a Courtsey clerk before I was let go. Nice co workers, I like being at a job that is busy. I was let go because I didn't pack the bags fast enough. Sorry I dont just throw people stuff into the bag with any and everything having the bag weigh 10pounds about to break as soon as they pick it up. Okay job to work at until you find a better one. Thank God I didnt plan on staying long or I would've been mad lol"
bad,In the right location it is a good job. Some stores don't get enough hours while others get too many.
bad,"This job was a grueling task to say the least. I was hired on as a student being payed minimum wage as a clerk. the days consisted of extremely early mornings 3am or earlier and at times 12 hour days up to 60 hours a week. the the work was first, stalk shelfs then off to the bakery to label pastries and bag bread. I trudged along for a few months then I was blindsided by a union representative. The summation of our ""conversation"" was; ""pay up or get out"". at this junction I did not have enough money to pay the lofty union entry fee."
bad,"it was a great co. to work for 25 years ago i loved my job still do, but safeway is changing hand and there getting rid of people who have been there a long time. which they did with me. i learned a lot did a lot but when one get older they tend to waste the people who know everything. a typical day at work last couple of years i checked 8 hrs a day 40 hr a week. i love and will miss my co workers except a few, i will be honest. the hardest part of the job was poor management. the most enjoyable part of job was working with my longtime co-workers. i like to work and do anything and everything is what made me happy."
bad,"I like the people i work with but i do not like the fluctuating hours and schedules and the monotonous days."
bad,Always given more work then one can finish in a full shift. Management for the most part is very poor but the co-workers are what get you through the day.
bad,Go in and prepare food for the day from salads to meats and chesses. Cook food to temp. Clean all day long to cashiering and customer service.
bad,"It's a busy environment working in a grocery store.  You have to be mentally ready, calm and courteous at all times, because the customers are a  little in the twilight zone."
bad,A typical day at work could range from 4-8 hrs. depending on the day you may or may not be allowed breaks. The manager doesn't properly train the employees for their daily tasks. Co-workers are one of the top reasons anyone would continue to work at that Starbucks. The hardest part of the job is rush hour and the lack of breaks and communications for what management wants from their employees. Not allowed tips and the union takes a majority of your first weeks paycheck which is small. During the interview they tell you your wages will be $8.00 an hr. but only pay you $7.80 until you confront them.
bad,"What I learned from working at Vons, is that it takes years and years to advance. The management overlooks the great qualities that one person has. The wage is too low and even employees that have been working in the company for over 25 years, recommend new employees to find better paying jobs."
bad,"A typical day is i go in and stock shelves and interact with customers, give direction to the product they are seeking. "
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but not the manager or the hours. I was getting too little pay for my experience. Especially since they hired on temps during the holiday and they made more than I."
bad,Pleasant interactions with customer.  Training for position was very lacking.
bad,"My overall experience at Safeway Canada has been a poor one. Everyday you are dealing with angry customers who are making ridiculous requests, but you have no power to give because of Safeway's management structure. "
bad,Working at Safeway is not what it used to be.  The company is not in the best place right now and the employees at the store level can certainly feel that.
bad,"Benefits are minimal, and quality of management varies greatly from store to store."
bad,I would get the deli ready for the day get the displays ready for the day cut meats and cheese and sometime cook as well as work with the public
bad,My manager lied to get his position then I went to college to improve my position. It didn't work that way
bad,"Hard work and constantly busy. This is a fast paced environment with constant service of foods of various sorts, the demand is very heavy and tiring."
bad,"didnt feel like part of the team, no one knew who i was or spoke to me."
bad,cleaning tables floors  i learned that the hardest time of the day was closing time i enjoyed working with the public 
bad,"getting the bread wall stocked, making sure the doughnut case was full, making sure you handled the costumers requests. i learned that no matter how old you get you'll always revert to a younger mind set in which you can do no wrong but others around you do no good, as well as you normally will have to train your own replacement. manager was never there when i worked except for a handful of times. acted like they were only two years old and couldn't stop complaining about one another to get any work done and always left early. drawing on the cakes after the cake decorators left to go home and how many like kids (that were getting the cake) had big toothless smiles on their faces."
bad,"One of the worst companies I have worked for in over 30 years as a pharmacist. The training is non-existent. Staff, in my opinion are set-up to fail due to lack of training/support and increasing work load Safeway does not care to fully technologize. Work long stretches with no support staff and their dealing with problems works one of 2 ways-let them fester then hammer down or just hammer down. Look at how high their Pharmacy staff turnover rate is. That tells the whole story"
bad,"The daily work routine was pleasant enough.  Most of the Pharmacists were professional and very appreciative of my help.  It was often expressed to me that I was one of the most requested floating technicians.  "
bad,I would like to enjoy an eight hour day and be productive to the company that I seek employment with.
bad,Be prepared to be micro managed. Management believes they have to look over your shoulder and hold your hand to complete every task. Very demanding job and always short on help.
bad,"The management in my store was atrocious, rude and condescending to both the employees and customers. They treated the part time employees like they were ""on call"" ALL the time, assuming you can work ANY time they need you (I was on a SCHEDULED VACATION and they tried to call me in, telling me if I don't show up I was going to get written up. They played games with our schedules, changing hours literally 2-3 hours before someone was supposed to come in - without calling them, and we would show up to work and get sent home - or we would be ""late"" because we had no idea they had marked us to come in early - no one ever called and when it was questioned we were told ""it is your job to know your schedule"" and we were supposed to ""call daily to see if our hours had been changed."" They would start us off with 30-40 hours and within one day of the schedule being out had cut back our hours to sometimes less than 20."
bad,management was not professional and not helpful. paid minimum wage
bad,Stocking and organizing food and supplies in store. Sweeping and mopping store every other hour. Customer service...bagging groceries and helping out customers to there cars. cleaning parking lot and pushing carts.
bad,This company does not treat there employees fair. I would not work with them again.
bad,It was an ok place to work for. They had good benefits and decent pay.
bad,"I have worked with Safeway for over a year now. The only reason I have continued working here is due to the slow job market. Safeway has not made it nearly impossible to support my daughter and myself. One week I will have 30+ hours and the next, I will have 20 hours. I started At $8.09/ hour, after a year of service I received a 30 cent raise. I believe a yearly raise should be based off performance, not time given. I grew up with a great work ethic. I work my tail to the bone in every job I do. I recieved the same raise as someone who did half the work I did and who calls off regularly. Another reason I would never recommend Safeway as an employer is the manditory Union membership. I agree Unions were started to protect the workers, but it has turned into a group that supports the employmnt of the lazy individuals. I pay $40 /month to be a member of the Union, for them to do nothing for me. I have tried to find a supplimental job on the side, but Safeway has made it so impossible. They require shift rotation and they ae unwilling to work around with the schedules. I ever know what my schedule will look like the next week."
bad,"Im 16 and this is my first job ever. I was happy because I was finally making my own money . I just thought it was just bagging groceries and doing carts , easy right? Wrong . The management treats the courtesy clerks like their own slaves . They make us do things which can be easily be done by them. The pay is horrible . $7.25 an hour . They scream at us for everything . They don't understand that we have multiple tasks and they expect us to get it all done by the end of our shifts . It would be nice if it was more organized . The only reason im working here is to support my family that is going through financial problems . But im leaving this place once I turn 18."
bad,Management and coworker mentality very low. Negative environment to work in.
bad,typical day at work-11 hr day managing store operations.i learned to care and be responsible for over 200 families.with the employees commitment we built solid shop standards for employees and our customers. hardest part of my job at Safeway was lack of vision at senior management level.there is no greater satisfaction than training and developing people.
bad,"Upper management in this company constantly preaches about work life balance, but when it comes down to it, they could care less about you, your family or any semblance of a life. Stringent bonus plans for store mangement, making it nearly impossible to reach any bonus potential. Salary compared to other big box retailers is mediocre at best and the benefits pale in comparison to other company's. Retirement benfits? Please, they are non existent when compared to other major corporations. All in all a horrible place to work with horrible ethics and any lack of feeling from upper management."
bad,"Didn't care for the way they treat their employees. No benifits as in insurance, dental etc."
bad,It use to be a much better company but it seems the company success is benifiting from its lack of labor! Cutting hours.
bad,"They will never bury you in work when you have a home store. While i was a road cutter, I found that I had mountains of work piled on me compared to when I would work in my home store. I learned how lopsided union work can be when you are on the wrong end. Most of the management was great, easy to work with, for, and talk to. Co-workers were a mixed bag, had some great ones and had some I wish i didn't work with, but in a union, they hang around longer than they should with poor job performance. The hardest part of the job was closing the department every night, unable to get requested days off due to events I have planned, or getting a steady schedule so I could plan things. The job dictated my life too much. The most enjoyable part of the job was easily the paycheck, without it, i would have left a lot soon, but some of my co-workers did make the job worth while as well."
bad,I truly enjoy my customers and the interactions with the people in the store. I have truly learned a lot about the retail food chains. I like all of my co-workers
bad,It has its ups and downs. Its a good place to learn ordering. no training.
bad,"i ran the store, i managed all the stores money. from 10 registers 6 self checkouts and 4 outside registers. i managed overrides. i cashed checks, did western union, lottery and any customer service."
bad,"Started off well, after a few weeks employees never really tried to connect with each other. very distant from new people. i feel like that is the reason people find it hard to stay. worked me 39 hours a week and would not give me any more so I cant get full time benefits."
bad,"Safeway was my first full-time job. At the time, I didn't have very many expenses, but I was intending to save up for my own apartment and car, in hopes of achieving a higher level of independence. Typically, you would start as a cart pusher and work your way up to cashier and so on, but my prior part-time experience as a cashier guaranteed me a job as such. The job itself was great at first, but the doldrums of monotony soon made it wear out its welcome."
bad,Very strict work environment. Little training. Anxiety inducing. Fast work pace. Dress codes were rarely followed. The interpersonal drama was commonplace. Few employees stuck to their duties.
bad,"Safeway was a great first job for me. I'd gladly take the opportunity to work there again if I lived close enough. The work felt satisfying and helped push me forward as a person. The management was awful, and it really teaches you how to deal with managers you don't like."
bad,"The attitude of the workers in general was very poor.  A lot of hard work on minimum wage.  Management seemed to always be sitting in the office laughing and slandering workers behind their backs.  In management, it is expected to have the work of 2 people done in a day-to stay overtime to finish the job, write schedules, run reports-yet was not compensated for extra time spent.  Wasted time in “meetings”, not supported by upper management ed"
bad,"A typical day for me was filled with negativity. The expectation to finish your job duties was high, with little to no support. Hours were consistently cut, and pay was not great for the amount of time you had to put in off the clock to finish your job duties."
bad,"Good work places thrive off of positive reinforcement and a healthy culture. Working in the Safeway bakery department was my first job ever, and those two things were barely present. Although it’s a busy job, working in the bakery isn’t a bad job when the department is run properly, but it was toxic and disorganized. My initial experience at Safeway made me scared to go to work; there were fights between employees and the amount of things they expected you to instantly remember was overwhelming. It was constantly disorganized, and my shifts were often changed a day before they were scheduled. I was criticized and threatened over small mistakes as a brand new employee. There were even a couple of times that my supervisor texted me outside of work and asked why I screwed up. I didn’t sleep well knowing I had to go to work; it made me anxious. My coworkers confided me when they learned I was quitting, and they shared how management has screwed them over with their pay raises and scheduling. This job should pay more than minimum wage."
bad,flexible hours.  Always busy which is good. Tasks are easy if you get used to it. Workplace culture needs improvement. Lack of Implementation of standard procedures
bad,"Rarely have I been so abused. Called in on most every day off, extended past end of shift. Took a leave of absence to deal with a medical issues and harassed upon return. Great money but not worth the headache in any way. Great customers made it bearable"
bad,"I wont even shop at this place after working there. They treat the employees like pawns. Management is horrible, and being replaced every 3 months. Terrible company."
bad,"Depending on your department, it’s a lot of standing around. I worked in cash so I stood at a till for hours on end unable to move and sometimes my feet would hurt so bad my tendons would feel like razors were cutting them. The benefits don’t really exist because you need a certain amount of hours they’ll never give you. They will use you constantly even if your in school. Customers were great tho"
bad,It was great at first but now I think Safeway treats their good employees terrible. They only want you to be about Safeway and they don't care if you're in college they won't work with your schedule. Maybe it's just the Safeway I'm at.
bad,A good team can make it a good place to work & a lousy unsupportive team can make it suck.  Turnover at my store was high. Lots of complaints from customers about things we couldn't change--like the homeless outside the store.
bad,"Associates were great to work with, job wasn't hard if management didn't micromanage and cut hours to a minimum. You were expected to do three people's jobs especially if they knew you were a good worker and 98% of the time were treated as if it wasn't enough and next time it needs to be done quicker. To Management you were replaceable. Take it or leave it....atmosphere"
bad,"Way to much expectation that never ceases to stop. Never will you be good enough for the store manager. No real job culture, high turnover rate and severe lack of training."
bad,"I think at Safeway I got very stressed out with the people there and all the drama that happened especially when people called in a lot. I also had hours that I would work closing for a week in a row, just because I was told I was good at it."
bad,Management accused me of defamation of character.  Not understanding or helpful in any way.  Lead me to feel forced to quit. Made me choose between family and work.
bad,"Good people with little managerial leadership in the payroll department.  Have lost 10 processors in the last year, with no replacements.    I have not seen a promotion of anyone in the payroll department in the 3 years I've been here."
bad,safeway had its up and its downs it was my first job in the retail field but it wasn't this best choice i ever made some managers were really cool and some where extremely rude i can remember a time my manager hired a brand new checkout clerk and she was making more than me based off the fact that she had more experience while i was working almost every department in the store and to top that my manager never even changed my job title when he promoted me he kept me as a courtesy clerk
bad,"Nothing is more important to Safeway than Safeway. If you're sick, they still want you to come in to work. They don't care about life outside of work, expecting you to only care about the company. The biggest part of the stress comes from the fact that they don't take into account the time it takes to help customers, getting angry when production isn't met, even though half your time is spent helping customers."
bad,I'd say the company should have there supervisors take some classes in ethics. If you don't mind not having the weekends off then this job is for you. Also the pay is not bad at all for this particular job.
bad,"My big problem was that it got to the point where I was only sleeping about 2 hours a night because the hours were all over the place.  I wasn't trying to get a 9-5 job with weekends off, because I only got it to get out of the house, but while I was there its was like you would work one day from 5 am to 1 pm and then the next shift would be 11 pm to 7 am and then the next shift would be 3 am a day later.  My days off would just be me trying to figure out how to take a nap without making myself unable to fall asleep that night for work the next morning."
bad,"I love working at Safeway as a assistant manager, my favourite parts of my job would be helping my customers as much as I can, whether that is with the fuel that we offer service with or helping them find the right oil for their car. I enjoy being the go to person for my staff to confide in about workplace issues, being the team coordinator for the gas station I'm mostly required to iron out any issues there might be."
bad,"management is full of stress and they want to pick for small things. visits all the time "
bad,"one of my first jobs so it was my first real experience dealing with customers and other staff members, packed grocery bags for customers and cleaned up spills in isles."
bad,"Safeway is a great place to work if you have never had a job before. The department managers are great, but they do the best with what they are given. Upper management expects too much and they never provide enough hours or training to complete the expected tasks."
bad,"I was there for almost 2 years. I started as a bagger, then was a checker, and was also a deli clerk. Pay is terrible I started at minimum wage and ended making 30 cents over minimum wage at the end. They’ll force you to work extra shifts during busy times of year and they don’t care if your a student or have family plans. Manament is lazy and what help anyone. You are forced to join a union that takes your money but doesn’t do anything to help you. If your trained as a checker your life will be even more busy because they never schedule enough help and you will called up to check all the time. Almost all the employees that have been there a long time in the store are very selfish and will never help. I think the only good Is normally the people who are your own age you normally become friends with and you get to complain about Safeway together"
bad,This is a rewarding job but is better for someone single without a family. long hours and no consistent days off. This makes is hard to plan things. at least 2 late shifts a week until 11pm or later depending on what store you work at and what kind of Manager you work with.
bad,"This is an honest review of my time at Safeway in the Lakewood Town-Center; there was seriously lack of training upon getting hired. I basically followed someone around for a few hours and watched some company policy videos online and that was all. I did not feel properly prepared for what I needed to know as a Courtesy Clerk. "
bad,"Safeway's customer service program sucked.  To customers, it was obvious that the customer service program was forced upon the employees.  The pleasantries were obviously fake and not from the employee's heart; just a part of your job.  In addition, your continued employment was determined upon one's customer service scores."
bad,No set schedule and always busy. Its a great place for your first job and to get your foot into the workforce. You learn a lot about customer service and dealing with disgruntled customers. The best part about the job is the managers and your co-workers.
bad,Safeway was a great place to work until they were bought out by an investment firm. Now all of the stores are understaffed and shelves are empty. It is difficult to run a good store if their are not enough people to do the work.
bad,"I’ve cleaned unthinkable things from that place, even when I wasn’t cleared to I was made to do it. The food has made me sick on occasions and the restrooms are a mess in general."
bad,Cool place to work good money good benifits but the mangement is very bothersome when trying to work also thought about filing harasment charges in produce area manger if you apply stay away from produce area
bad,"Opening Shifts were all about cooking and lots of cooking."
bad,"I worked for Safeway for about two years and I started at the bottom of the food change. I worked extremely hard to go from a CC to the Head Cake Decorator...I even went to college for this job! They fought me day and night over a raise - wanted to keep me at an APC rate instead of a Decorator. They cut hours and then complain when things don't get done. I even had my store manager tell me to just work off the clock because he wouldn't get his bonus if we stayed clocked in. EXAMPLE: I was in the bakery...because of that manager and our store manager, they had counting myself, EIGHT people quit on spot. I will never shop there again!!!"
bad,Day working at Safeway deli looks like walking into the deli with not enough employees to help with costumers. When there is enough coworkers most are hiding in the back or trying to do what ever else to not help the costumers. When talking to management they put blame on one another without fixing the problem.
bad,The managers would not give anybody 40 hours a week.  If you were hired on a cashier and they needed somebody in a different department they would put cashiers in other departments with no training.  They would not put enough cashiers on and were always calling people from other departments to fill in as cashiers off and on throughout the whole day.
bad,worked in the freezer with produce at 36 degrees 6-7 hours per day cutting fruit.  No first aid kit available.  Concrete floor with no safety mat.  No supervisor.
bad,"Customers are always right, even when they're wrong.   Management is not supportive.   Some favoritism is clearly allowed here.    Very little training is provided; employee morale is low."
bad,"Management was horrible all around. Sick time was hard to used back when i worked here, had to miss three days in order to use your time. Everyone always seemed grumpy and unhappy to be there. it was hard for me to deal with the drama within my department, you know, adults should be adults. I did meet a lot of friends I will probably have for a long time. And the health care was kind of bad, but dental was amazing!!"
bad,"Safeway is only a job that is for management or something temporary, due to the fact that the pay is low for a normal level worker. the customers at the store at work at work is only soccer moms who had no patience and old white people complaining about not having fresh chicken. my manger was an okay manger, i loved that she laughed at other peoples comments about her and her deli."
bad,"The Work and Pay and Hours are Good"
bad,"My typical day started after lunch, where I'd deal with slacking co-workers untill the later hours of the day. We'd be left with very few employees when dinner rushes hit-usually 2, 3 on a good day. due to the heavy traffic, the closing crew would struggle without the third man to meet the closing deadlines. counter at ten, everything by eleven."
bad,"Safeway had provided me with a good retirement, however my issue with this company was that the later years a person was not held accountable for their actions and as a manager it was very hard to get upper manager support for problems within the departments. I was very much in favore of team work and everyone doing there job for the good of the department, however it was very hard to get the support to do ones job as manager. Didn’t like how I felt in just letting everyone do as they wished and needed to move on."
bad,A typical day of work would be coming in to cut and package fruit while waiting for following employees to come in at later times. I learned how to properly cut and package fruits and veggies while maintaining food health standards.
bad,"A typical day as a bookkeeper lasted about 8-9 hours. To balance the cashier tills, we had to count and record all paper and coin currency in the safe. After balancing and delivering all the tills to every register and department in the store, we prepared the Guarda pick-up bags. Throughout the day, we would also assist all customers at the customer service desk, providing general assistance along with lottery and Western Union transactions. Occasionally we would assist with any technical issues with receipt printers, cash registers, and self-check out registers. "
bad,Some of the worker are nice. The front end manager isn’t really that great and the hours for full time suck if you say can’t work a certain day . When you work the closing shift you may be alone for an hour or so up front
bad,"I liked working here as a first job, but there was no room for advancement and no benefits. The hours were extremely inconsistent. I enjoyed working with the store manager, but lower-position managers were not always helpful. Not much room for creativity or suggestions. Such a strong focus is placed on getting good surveys, that they don't actually care about what is in the surveys that they can improve upon. Would recommend for a first job for high school students. Wouldn't recommend for anyone looking to make a living or improve their working experience."
bad,you can expect that there will not be enough help for the customers and everything to get done as well unless there is a corporate walk through in which case there too many people there
bad,"Stressful. "
bad,"This workplace is nothing but a job. The store that I am at in particular is always busy with customers, understaffed, and having things stolen from us. This store does not make a reasonable profit. The head manager is unreasonable and does not support employees. This is also an unsafe work environment."
bad,"Bad management. The deli manager and Asst. manager would always call out sick or show up to work when ever they felt like it, and would leave whenever they felt like it. Employees would constantly call in sick. Bad management = employees who don't care about their jobs. That's why I only worked there for 3 months. This job was not a good fit for me."
bad,was hired as part time and was scheduled 30+ hours a week.  Closing shifts left me too tired for school and I was often scheduled at the same time as my classes.  Discounts on food and weekly pay were probably the only benefits to working there. Hardly ever saw the manager.
bad,This year that i worked for safeway was a good one the overall vibe of that time working there was great. coworkers were nice and knew how to treat customers and coworkers nice.
bad,"At first I enjoyed the positions I was working, however after a year and a half of hard work and not taking vacation or sick days they still refused to raise my wage above minimum. Even upon promotion they refused to pay anything but minimum wage."
bad,I just dont think The stores should be open On christmas day!!!! Its wrong!!  we never Really get to enjoy the holidays!! its Just the money Greed & they dont Care about there Employees At all!!
bad,Horrible management.split days.no communication.unorganized.no one wants to help out.management doesn't want to meet 50.50 nor do they care.were pushed so hard and expected perform at such a high level yet management is non exsisting
bad,"no job sercurity' "
bad,"Of all times to have this job I am thankful for my first employment opportunity was a courtesy clerk at the age of 16. However, after a couple years and becoming wise to the lack of change and opoportunity, one should move on not plan on making a career out of it if you want to be happy in life. The only benefit is the job security from being in a union."
bad,A typical day at work was fast paced and customer service driven. The management was sporadic due to constant General manager reassignments. The most enjoyable part of my job was building friendships with my customers.
bad,No training!  They just had me jump right in ringing up customers.  Had no idea what I was doing.  Cases of beer get stolen every night and yet they refused to lock one set of doors like most other Safeways do.
bad,@ management tells you what they know you want to hear to shut you up you will get ours but the pay sucks the employees are all about themselves there's no teamwork management does not produce results the store is a mess
bad,I wouldn't recommend this job to my worse enemy. I didint realize of toxic environment that was at this safeway until i quit. The place is a continue revolving door that cant seem to keep employees for more then 3 months
bad,I did t care for the attitude or the rudeness of other people. It made me upset going to work and having people (I.e. my manager) yelling at me telling me how bad of a job I did.
bad,"Once I was in the position of Assistant Store manager I worked 50-60 hours a week on salary. I was over used and under appriciated. I performed many tasks that typical grocery clerks should be hired for. I had too much to do on a daily basis and felt set-up for failure. didn't appricated the district managers approach. Not very personable. My last store manager had issues with anger and rage. Mistreated employees and got promoted to a nicer, bigger store."
bad,"Lack of Management."
bad,Quite stressful accentuated by low pay and very few benefits. I could not adjust to the work culture and this made the job very stressful. The management left much to be desired off
bad,"bunch of lazy people, can never get anything done, hours suck. there are some good hard working people there but not many. Managers have their favorites"
bad,"Wonderful employees, negative upper management. Constantly understaffed with overload on workers with minimum wage. Very inflexible with employees' schedule needs. Did not return because it wouldn't have been possible to work out solid daycare for my child and have the pay be worth it. Okay job for a part time employee/ student."
bad,"Benefits are good overall. Weekly paycheck is always awesome."
bad,"Was constantly on the move, only 2 fifteen minute breaks and a half hour lunch SOMETIMES. I'm fine with working hard, and was promoted from stocker to Assistant Manager to Dairy Manager within 6 months, though through it all I got a pay cut. Heard management does it so they make a bigger paycheck."
bad,"I'm here 5 times a week. The employees are so kind and personable. Everyone is always happy and welcoming. From the cashiers to the baggers to the bakery/deli to the meat department, they have been so awesome to me and my family. Never encountered a grumpy employer."
bad,"Small town pharmacy with numerous hospitals in the area, recipe for a busy store. Lack of qualified help and alway training or looking for new  technicians. Most of the work load got pushed upon the pharmacist. Very stressful work environment, I know every store is different, so this is just a snap shot of this particular store."
bad,"No one to take charge, long time techs did what they pleased. Floating pharmacist did not enjoy working there and most of the time things would not get done."
bad,At first I thought it was going to be an enjoyable experience  but on my first night I was told I wasn't allowed to clock off when my shift ended because my coworkers left me alone which was against policy.  They have major favoritism issues here and the management tried to make up their own rules to get what they wanted when they wanted.  They took me off the schedule for 3 weeks . During those 3 weeks I was checking in daily to see if I was working and then after the 3 weeks the store manager let me know she heard a rumor and had to let me go.
bad,I worked Night Crew and my fellow employees and our management team always never saw eye-to-eye. So I was unhappy for 6 years. I replenished shelves and rotated product.
bad,was a decent job for being in college. the store general manager didn't care for employees and never reached out. benefit packages were inconsistent..
bad,"I worked here for 14 years but after that time it was time to go. I did not see me moving up or out to a better position so I needed a change. I worked in the deli most of the time I did work at Safeway and you can get burnt out very quick. It is a fast paced job and a stressful job if things don't run smooth which all boils down to the crew and most importantly the supervisor for that dept. I did enjoy it at some times but people change and come and go and at the time of me leaving it was my time to go. I am looking to move up with a company not just stay in one spot for all the years I am there, they say they are a promote from within company but it is not true for some. If they need you in the dept. you are in then that is where you stay. The benefits are the best part of this job. Medical is great as well as dental and vision. I will miss the benefits but sometimes you have to make sacrifices for a change."
bad,Safeway doesnt see their employees as people you are nothing more than mindless slaves to them. They dont train you properly  not even close to it infact.  Will even stick you in a department your not trained for. the lower on the store staff ranking level you are  at the more you get blamed when something goes wrong in the store even if you didnt do it.
bad,"Easy beginning part-time job, the tasks are easy to perform with some company benefits and discount. The pay is just minimum. The schedule isn't consistent."
bad,I would not work at this company ever again due to the terrible management that is provided. They do not care about their employees and they will steal from you if they have a chance.
bad,"Great benefits, high employee turnover and lack of skilled upper management. Low pay for entry level positions, ongoing labor cuts affect productivity."
bad,i would get there at 6 and stand in a room for 8 hours cutting fruit i didnt enjoy it. some people were great but some people were horrible. an older worker who worked there a long time got me introuble a lot because for some reason she hated me.
bad,Not the best company to get promoted in and grow any additional skills. Many employees have to save money for future surgery on backs and knees. Once an employee makes the top store management they realize that the hours needed to fulfill job requirements leaves no time for family or free time.
bad,Management will do everything to push you around and treats employees like children. Union however will fight for you to keep your job if they fire you for most circumstances and guarantees raises based on hours worked
bad,"typical day at work for me was coming in and doing what employees left of their assignments to do plus staying on top of my own. management was very poor, managers did not make female employees do their work instead assigned the guys to do their work. hardest part of the job was balancing m work and other given work that others wouldn't do. most enjoyable part was some employees that I stay in contact with."
bad,"Safeway can be very stressful for a number of reasons that cannot be easily explained in this format. It is a good starting job, they will train you, as long as your willing and able, to do pretty much anything in the store, making you more valuable and flexible to the store. A lot of store managers start out as Courtesy Clerks and rise through the ranks.There a constant struggle of needing help and quality help at that.  If you know someone that works at a Safeway, talk to them about it, it can be a miserable place sometimes so  feel it out. You may like it and make it work but just be careful with getting stuck there, you may regret it later."
bad,"typical  workday:8hr work day"
bad,"Really changed since Safeway acquired by Albertsons.  Took away employee association/benefits (employee fundraisers, discount tickets to sporting events, movies, etc.) that made you feel part of a family, not anymore.  If looking to move up, management plays favorites to certain clique, regardless of experience.  Once you go above and beyond as a hard worker you will be taken advantage of.  Benefits are okay, noticing slowly being taken away.  The job (work) itself is great, get ready to learn a lot and meet many wonderful people within organization and externally."
bad,Not enough hours and not enough pay! If safeway wants to prevent turn over they need to offer full time at a higher rate. Even though staff are awesome .....paying bills is important to!
bad,"All it takes is one busy day at Safeway to see it can get pretty hectic. On the weekends or normally after 3 pm, the store can get insanely busy. But thanks to that I developed my customer service skills over the years and its helped me interact with people a lot better. Sometimes we were understaffed and overworked. The employees in my store were amazing with a few exceptions. Management was horrible though. Bosses didn't genuinely care for employees, they had favorites and it became so bad that I lost interest in working for them. The hardest part was definitely dealing with the managers. The most enjoyable part was the flexible schedule (when they actually gave you the schedule you ask for.)"
bad,everything is done by seniority. there is room for advancement and growth. no set hours or schedule. the management is not to helpful and at times are only worried ab out their bonuses
bad,"I didn't really feel like my position as a courtesy clerk at safeway had all that much upward momentum, but it was a paycheck. Super easy job. Pushing carts, putting stuff back on the shelf. Stressful hours though. Always random. Don't expect people to respect you."
bad,"Employees can sum it up to you with a one word pun: ""slaveway""... No one could ever get paid enough for the things employees have to deal with at safeway..."
bad,"The typical day of work consisted of interacting with customers solving any discrepancies, managing the cash transactions, and delegating tasks to coworkers."
bad,"It might help to improve your English but there was no appropriate management on the workload for cashiers, the time you have to standup would cause health problem in long-run. Your hands would also be in touch with red light (maybe laser) during scanning the barcodes throughout the working hours."
bad,i Thought cool I'm gonna work at safeway where they got great benefits and it looks pretty chill. How wrong was I. I work in the deli where its constant complaints of everybody trying to get free chicken/sandwiches. Management doesn't work properly we are alway short staffed because they let everybody call out there have been times where I am left alone from 5 to 10 and I still have to keep the deli open till 9.
bad,"On a daily basis was a full day of orders, customers and just hard work.  On your feet for 6 to 7 hours on concrete floors was hard on the feet and back.  I did enjoy decorating cakes and the baking of some goods."
bad,"My experience  it's Safeway was ok at first was an amazing job I loved to do, but once the company was sold to "" Albertsons And Sons "" my management team stopped caring for the customers and our reviews on yelp went down the drain. Also I was in college when I first started Safeway, but they refused to work with me on my school schedule and scheduled me at all times. Even though I would always help them when I could."
bad,"The union keeps wages low, work culture blows, thinking is not appreciated. If you started on the old-old contract you're making great money. If you've just started, you get very little and you'll never be appreciated for the work you do."
bad,The pay was bad the hours and they wouldn't even allow you to get overtime. An if you did you would get in trouble. My co-workers were very nice and they helped me out when i first started
bad,"A typical day at work used to be fun, and exciting, not because I learned new things everyday, but the atmosphere was amazing, we could take care of patient's needs on a personal level, fairly low stress, benefits were good, it was great. "
bad,"The union steals $50/month from each employee, and in return they ensure at least 24 hours/week, but that's about all they're good for. Several of my coworkers, whose only source of income is this job, often have their hours cut down to 24 hours/week."
bad,"Management  has been cutting hours and people are quitting . Good coworkersneed more freight crew"
bad,"In pharmacy, you work your butt off but it is NEVER enough. Give you so much to do that you don't have time to fill prescriptions! Then they give techs generic lab coats to wear that are men's sizes and we look unprofessional. Albertsons takeover consists of bringing Safeway DOWN to their level. So sad. Used to be proud and excited to go to work now we are all looking for new jobs. They cut hours so much we can't give our customers good service, just hurry and try to get everything done, hopefully without errors. "
bad,A typical day would consist of me cooking and selling seafood. I worked by myself almost all the time. I learned ALOT of patients. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep everything filled up and take orders but after a while it became really simple.
bad,"Collecting carts for customers, sweeping the, cleaning up messes and spills. The hardest part was dealing with co-workers who were acting like my superiors, and trying to tell me what to do and not doing anything. Management was okay, before my transfer, and the reason being was because my current manager fails to see how that no person can survive on one hundred dollars a week. There really was no enjoyable part of the job. I've learned that I have to be independent when some co-workers refuse to do their job, or do don't do it correctly."
bad,After a while I want to learn something new & move on to something different for a challenge. Wouldn't do it again.
bad,Vons was a good place to work. the employees/co workers were a pleasure to be around. It had a decent work environment. except when situations would come up and management would leave you hanging and toss you under the buss
bad,It can be very repetitive. Not enough help. You must work there a long time in order to advance or make a lot of money. Not to mention you must work there over a year in order to get insurance
bad,Advancement in pay is by hours worked and not by skill or how hard you work. Spend a lot of time cleaning and helping customers. Easy job if you like being bored and doing monotonous work. Best part of the job is seeing people you know all day long.
bad,"hardest part of the job is dealing with customers and management. Maybe other locations are more flexible with schedules but the one I was at you had to fight vehemently to get a schedule that worked.  Pay is pretty low and favoritism runs rampant throughout the store, so become friends with the manager it really helps if you want more hours. communication between departments is horrible, a great example is our head night stocker had never even met the current manager, they would always schedule floor cleanings and never tell us. One plus I suppose is it's almost impossible to get fired. you have to blatantly steal if you want to get fired. advancement is a joke unless you plan on spending +10 years you will probably just stay in whatever position you go hired in at. To wrap this up I would definitely try to avoid safeway. actually one huge piece of advice, avoid checker training if you can, the second you get trained your workload practically triples and that's compensated by a 10 cent raise at best."
bad,"For minimum wage, workers at Safeway work there butts off. There is the Union, which offers benefits for people that want it, but if you don't, you have to pay anyways. The managers and the people I worked with were lovely, but the insanity that is retail was just not for me."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at Safeway. I never knew when I was going to be scheduled, it was completely random. the scheduling made it hard for me to balance school, work, and a social life."
bad,"My typical day of work is I walk in and ask what I'm supposed to do. They switch me around a lot and it's a little frustrating because every day, before I go to work, I don't know what I'm supposed to do and always have to ask someone. I don't like that at all. "
bad,"The Store it's self is in disrepair and there is relatively no camaraderie.  There is no proper training of new employees and there is no communication between management and employees.  "
bad,It's a nice place to work at part time because you wont get 40hrs probable ever. I had fun working there most of the employees and most of the customers were nice.
bad,Broken carts and other safety hazards were actively neglected by the management team after reporting it to them. I wouldn't recommend working for them. the pay isn't enough to compensate the hassles.
bad,"Worked in fast pace environment, responding to and providing assistance to a steady flow of phone calls.  Able to multi-task while performing numerous responsibilities.  Ability to communicate with all levels of exempt and non-exempt personnel.  Strong leadership that involves problem solving and followup.  Motivational leader who promotes teamwork, enthusiasm and creates a positive work environment within a diverse workforce.  Strong generalist that encourages business performance and culture."
bad,"My job starts at 1am to see that everything is proofed, topped, and baked to be on the sales floor by 5am. I am also in charge of filling out SMP reports, time logs, distress sheets. As well as making sure the bakery is in spotless condition and ready for visitors including eco-lab, and or merchandisers to come by."
bad,"This is a hard job no matter what department you decide to go into. "
bad,"I had a great experience working in the gas bar, i loved the regularity of my customers, but most of the people i worked with did not care to do what theyre job was and management never did anything about them or the issues which would be brought to their attention."
bad,"The most rewarding part of the job are the relationships you form with your customers.  The work can be very physically demanding, and management fairness varies from store to store."
bad,"1. A typical day at work felt like tired, stressed, dark, angry and cold."
bad,"Overall it is not a bad place to work as a first job. This is a company ran by a union so you pay union dues, but will not receive any better pay. You always have room for advancement but the pay raise is next to nothing. This is not a company you can build a career out of unless you're in upper management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with stress of angry customers because of bad scheduling and long lines. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with co-workers and normal customers. A typical day at work consists of either, being in a check stand, stocking, bagging, or working in an outside department."
bad,"Good job not career, management could be better. Best part of job was clocking off"
bad,I learned to organize my tasks effectively to get them all done and how to communicate with people easily.
bad,"Stocking items, bagging and taking peoples stuff to their cars."
bad,Working for Safeway was a simple job that required me to work the general merchandise department and the customer service desk.
bad,felt like I was just a number here. I worked my butt off and never felt like management appreciated it.
bad,"Basically, this is not an organization that respect people based on their contribution or ability to perform a job. In this environment, the culture is one that promotes people on longevity at the company and who you know."
bad,The job was much more work than I feel it needed to be with little room as an employee to improve efficiency.
bad,this was my first job. When i left i realized this job didnt compensate to much on how much you did.
bad,"A typical day would not be too bad. I just had to get my responsibilities out of the way while helping throughout the store. No tasks were unable to ever be done in an untimely fashion. Management was not the best. They would always be in their offices throughout the day, and when called on the intercom for customer service, they would often ignore."
bad,A typical day at work is fast paced and I learn customer service. Management changes a lot. Co workers are pleasant and keep the job fun.
bad,"I enjoyed the customers and co workers at Safeway, however the management didn't have any follow through. It made it difficult to keep up the moral at the store."
bad,"With Safeway, it really depends on what store, and even department you are working in, to know if they are a good fit for you. I found my store's management changed frequently, and job openings are not abundant in our town so there were major cuts to the winter crew to hire back in summer, really cutting into benefits. My specific store and management did not work well, and would drop the ball. It was hectic and I am glad I am not working for them anymore, I think they burned me from ever wanting to work in a grocery store again, especially the Deli or Bakery departments, which they under-staff and expect 1 person to get everything done. I worked two summers in Deli and over a year in Bakery."
bad,"People do not do their jobs, and all the customers were snobs."
bad,Working at Safeway was very stressful. I worked all through college and they wanted me to work 40 hours every week. Felt like they did not care about me when it came to school.
bad,"The job was a part-time endeavor while continuing studies. It provided some extra money, however the hours were incompatible with study schedule. There were few people available to work the closing shift which made meant working and closing everyday leaving little room for study and free time. Staff were mostly high-schoolers and many did not perform duties with any efficiency. "
bad,"Vons gets very busy and there are never enough checkers. Also the sales ads can be very confusing as well as the sales tags on the shelf, leaving a lot of angry customers. The new Just for You sales program does not make sense. Vons should just give the sales prices to all of their customers without having them go on a computer for hours, especially those that are not accustomed to using computers at all."
bad,"As I worked at Safeway for the past couple years, I have noticed a few small things. Room for advancement came to the not qualified, but more well liked. Business decisions were thrown out without warning that make you feel like you are tripping over yourself before you even start to run. The management really do care, but the IT and poor marketing strategies will throw you under the bus seemingly everyday. It's nice if in desperate need of a job, but please consider this company as a stepping stone to something greater. "
bad,"My experience might be simply personal, I don't know. I was given a position I didn't not apply for, but was promised a chance to move up quickly. A few months in, I was blatantly told that there were no positions open for me to even attempt to move to, then the location highered several people at positions above mine. The people that were also courtesy clerks were always doing jobs at most half done, then I would get into minor trouble for working slow when it was because I was having to do twice the work. The managers seemed to be aware of this, but didn't seem to care. And finally, despite doing all the work like cleaning and helping customers, other employees and even managers would treat us like we were worthless."
bad,Honestly The title sums it up. The management at the store I worked at were heavy with hiring and advancing people they liked and refused to advance people who worked and did as they were asked. I was fired for a ridiculous reason and was not allowed to advance under any circumstances.
bad,"At Safeway I was able to develop my skills as a Customer Service representative and leadership skills.I was in charge of the front end.I had to ensure that everything was running smooth and looking fantastic.I also was able to get experience in the bakery,we had a display case that I would set up in the morning with fresh baked items."
bad,"This job as a cashier is repetitive and hard on the back, I enjoy the customers most of the time. Our manager is really great but he has little say in what transpires. I like my co-workers but the politics are a bit much. I stay out of it. The hardest part of the job is the repetition and lack of variety in the job. The best part is getting to know the customers."
bad,"safeway is a great employer. just not for me, i dislike there union but i would recomened the job"
bad,"a day at safeway greeting customers, scanning items helping customers, bagging."
bad,Carts during summer worst part of the job when you first start.
bad,"Promised me a job in florence OR, after i got moved they said job was not their, after i worked for them for ten years, they wouldnt give me back my job in stayton OR, or pay for me to move back. They put me on extra board, in salem, and fired me for telling a joke. i guess they then could hire their apprentence. I won two of their gold awards for $500 in stock getting 18 out of 20 perfect secret shops, which was only done by a few employees."
bad,"This is a very stressful work environment, most employees are very unhappy. I believe it is due to poor management per store. Lack of training new hire's and 5 years or more before substantial increase in pay. HR doesn't return phone calls."
bad,"Pay was low, I was laid off affter a few months of working there, and was never told my name was just removed from the schedual."
bad,"Pay is good but if you are in the role I was as the sole tech in a remote zone, you always have to be available for the job. No guaranteed days off unless on Paid Time Off. This also led me into performing the deployment of new equipment at night while maintaining the equipment during the day time, so that they didn't have to spend the money to get a deployment tech into a remote location. They will not accommodate you due to the nature of the business."
bad,"I enjoyed the environment. Worked in produce and cashier. "
bad,"When working for Safeway, you’re a slave. They expect you to do this and that but give no positive energy back. When going beyond  Repeatedly It doesn’t matter. I used to absolutely love and brag about working for Safeway, now it’s no longer family and friendly oriented. Sadly the moral is up so much at several stores."
bad,"being a union shop it has its own issues to deal with, the lack of management being consistent there is a problem. If you work hard there in management it can hurt your chances of advancement more then help unless you play their game. lots of promises but not much on follow thru."
bad,Horrible management and the union representative never really did anything about how people are unfairly  treated by management .  There were numerous calls and complaints from employees and customers. Instead of reprimanding them they got promoted.
bad,I was treated like I was not wanted but I am a very good worker and I excelled at it a over took most of the people I worked with. the main manager was a doll and a good person to work with the store manager was fair but the overall atmosphere was satisfactory.
bad,"Safeway has an amazing work environment and wonderful customers. I really enjoyed my time managing my own department and my job became my passion quickly. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out for me there after management switched over."
bad,"My coworkers were great however management and customers often made the job more difficult/stressful than it needed to be. There was no consistency with my schedule which made it difficult to plan things with family/friends. The job also became very monotonous after a while, there is definitely room to move up the ladder if you want to but I had no plan on investing in a long term career with Safeway."
bad,I know have a happy life except the job part. I am eager to start any new opportunity. :) I have been there 23 years. I have held all roles there and I guess they want us older ones :( I have great passion a positive attitude great work ethic and very reliable.
bad,"I’ve worked for this company for over 10 years and they aren’t treating me as if I matter. My wage has been frozen since I entered pharmacy school and I keep getting told that I’ll get a raise at this point or that point and nothing has happened, they keep changing when I am “due” for a raise, despite the fact that technicians that have been with the company less time than I have been are Now making more than I am. I would expect a little better treatment for long standing employees especially when they’re furthering their education and can become an asset to the company."
bad,"Ran a crew of up to 5 people in summer. I hired, fired, trained, maintain dept. standards and safety. Ordered product, inventoried product. Was responsible for all aspects of the including customer service dept."
bad,"Don't get caught doing nothing for more than 10 seconds. As a courtesy clerk, you're required to stay occupied at all times."
bad,Sucks. No one is really happy to be working there. Upper management is always trying to find someone to push the blame on. They rather replace you than pay you more.
bad,"Typical grocery job, though my manager was keen to use me, a mother of a small child, as a way to fill in the holes in her scheduling.This thankfully ended and I was put onto a regular scheduled when I confronted her."
bad,I would recommend working elsewhere. It takes months if not years to move up. I was an employee for almost 2 years and I got treated terribly. Would recommend not working here.
bad,I can't make my bills they cut my hours from 25-30 each week. It's not consistent days each week is different. I like my co-workers but getting a .5 cent raise each year is not competitive with other companies. I wouldn't complain if they paid me more and gave me more hours.
bad,They were always understaffed so I had to do multiple job positions at the same time while getting paid for just one. Also the work culture was nit fun because the coworkers didn't get along well.
bad,I thought this was a great company to work with everyone there was amazing. The only problem was with management I thought they could have been better with assigning the work schedule.
bad,"In my experience the department managers are good but the store director always bring morale to rock bottom to the point where everyone is quitting including me. However, if you are looking for a job while in college they can accommodate for it. Just don't apply if you are looking for anything more than 30 hours because hours get cut on a regular basis."
bad,"Safeway is a union job, and the way pay raises were administered along with Washington's yearly adjustments to minimum wage meant that the only way to make more money was to advance positions."
bad,The manager couldn't communicate and doesn't really do his job or treat employees well.. they are so unorganized.. lots of drama and high turn over since it became sobeys
bad,"The store manager at the time I worked there was a tyrant and made everyone feel like they weren't allowed to enjoy life at all. It made working there uncomfortable and not fun. The Deli portion I worked in was a large workload and not enough help. Starbucks was the same at times, especially with sales/promotions. Safeway was cheap with labor and made their employees suffer because of it."
bad,"As a student job during high school, Safeway was convenient and pretty easy but as a full time career, the environment was not conducive to collaboration and was completely disorganized causing me to miss out on over 80 hours of potential work."
bad,"Although there are policies to protect employees management often finds ways around that. Of course every store will differentiate in professionalism, the store I work with lacks a lot of professionalism. The store I work at bids schedules based off seniority, meaning that the people that have worked there the longest get to choose first the hours they would like to work. If you are not interested working a variety of different hours (overnights, early morning, mid shifts, or closing shifts) this may not be an ideal place of employment for you. Full time positions are very hard to come by, only the most senior people are offered full time. When promotional opportunities become available, they use what is called manger's discretion meaning that even if you apply and you are the most qualified for that position, the manger can choose whoever they wish to fill it. The store I work for has a union which in a lot of ways is beneficial but in others is negative. You are expected to pay a union fee every time you get paid (automatically taken out of check) the most negative thing about working with a union is that it takes a lot to terminate an employee, even if that employee is unreliable or lacks work ethic. Positive thing is that you cannot be fired for something ridiculous and you are always able to dispute issues with management with a union representative."
bad,"Worked with some of the hardest working, responsible people,  great employees to have, but totally ignored by the company, maybe a letter from corporate or $5 gift card only if you were recognized on their surveys  Your dedication to your customers or the fact you showed up everyday on time for 20 yrs with maybe 3 call outs, stuff like that is of not worthy of recognition. I watched so many talented young people come and go because other than some decent medical benefits, there was no feeling that you were valued by the company. The break rooms were always a ghetto, just discouraging."
bad,"I’ve worked for this company over 10 years, they cut hours and increase work loads with minimal raises. About the only time you get hours to do your job is when corporate comes in but then expectations are so crazy that the hours still don’t make up for it, only to cut your hours when they leave to not do your actual job of pleasing customers and having a good operating store.  It’s a corporation that has its priorities not in the right spot and I wouldn’t recommend it if you want to be treated fairly."
bad,"Safeway was not enjoyable for me, I worked hard for long hours and the pay was way under than it should be in my opinion. Probably the most stressful activity I have done was work there."
bad,Safeway was a different experience for me in the work place. First time every working with food it’s definitely a different work experience i will cherish.
bad,"Personally, I was not incredibly fond of my time at Safeway. The specific Safeway I worked at was incredibly stressful. There were many general managers, and they did not communicate well with each other or with staff. As a Courtesy Clerk, I was the lowest rung on the totem pole and made to do jobs that I was not supposed to."
bad,never know what your week will be 20 hrs or ?????  Schedules are written bellow salary projections and then a person shows up for work and is asked to work more than scheduled... It can ruin your day but if you need the money you do what they ask.
bad,A lot of standing and walking around doing petty work. If you are looking for a job that isn't too depressing this isn't the one. If you are looking for a easy straight forward temporary job this is the one
bad,The job is hard work with 10 minute break.  Low hours low pay for really hard work.  No  choice for hours. Too hard to transfers. Don't give you first choice at jobs openings.
bad,"I had a pretty good expeirence for the first half of my time employed there. The pay was bad(min wage) considering we had to pay union dues, but the management was fair, they were pretty accommodative, decent hours for a high schooler, and manageable tasks. When the management had a change, that all changed as well. You had your hours drastically cut if you ever requested time off, management was extremely disrespectful to employees, and they started micro-managing simple tasks to the point where it became grueling to do things like clean the bathroom. Also, they are not good at pest control. I’ve seen ants in the donut case, a cockroach in the bakery, and the bread displays have mouse traps because it’s such a problem. I’ve heard other stores are better, and that’s probably true given my initial experience. It’s not necessarily worth giving it a chance as you will be making minimum wage while also paying union dues(their union is garbage)."
bad,"Working for Safeway was like working in a high school. Department managers were usually cool unless it was a stressful day, but store managers had their priorities screwed, and 90 percent of customers made it apparent they were more annoyed by the employees than satisfied with their service."
bad,Management would expect extreme amounts of work with little to no appreciation for the work being done. The chances to advance in the company was very far and few between and if management knew you wanted to move up they were quick in making sure that they sucked every ounce of work from you.
bad,"The employees are unionized at Safeway which leads to good long term benefits. However, most benefits don't start until at least six months in, so it is in the company's benefit to go through employees quickly. To do that, they actively shirk rules and laws designed to help employees, have no positive community building, poor starting wage, no casual benefits (like fun breakroom, activities, etc.). I left because the store failed to follow the new Fair Work Week law in Oregon."
bad,"Crazy work environment. Very stressful, especially on holidays. Union company but the union is a mess and doesn't hold any power. Health benefits are imposed even if you don't want them."
bad,I would be assigned multiple tasks a day by the hour. I have learned how to work hard even when very tired and learned discipline and organization. The management was decent and did not really give time off. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and other peoples goals of how Safeway helps build a strong foundation.
bad,"Not the worst, not the best. It is okay for a temporary job, but not the best if you would like to advance your career. Benefits were good though....."
bad,Baggjng groceries for 14 major annoying customers being lied to about the paper products in the bathrooms cleaning up spills and emptying trash carts.
bad,"honestly not a very good place to work management was consistently a joke always felt like you were coming in to pick up another workers slack consistently management was poorly done always was nerve wreck each and every single day and the night crew standards were very unrealistic with split days off each week  30 min lunches and barely good space in break periods deli was absolutely filthy behind the scenes and the conditions of the floors and etc "
bad,"Safeway as a company, is good."
bad,"It's a standard deli. A lot of gossip, not a lot of productivity. Management is fairly laid back as long as what needs to happen gets done on time. Hours can be inconsistent."
bad,"Good little job, trusted to maintain work in the absence of line manager. Line manager had bad habit of amending work rota without notice and not being aware of study requirements away from work"
bad,Standing for over 8 hours a day with a 15 minute break. Not able to call out for any emergencies unless you go to the doctors and get a note. Very quick pace job.
bad,"Clientele is easy to manage with a positive and patient attitude. Unfortunately management is not reliable at most levels. Inconsistent compensation, lack of understanding of customer needs, etc. Also the building itself has issues with keeping shelves full, a malfunctioning restroom, and the backroom is often left cluttered which poses a fire hazard."
bad,my boss didnt like anyone and would always get upset i asked for help to learn where and how we would perform the job.didnt hire other employes to help in our faclity there was supposed to be 5 to six people working over night to help insure store was stocked and it would only be me and him and he would be no where to be found unless i paged him on the intercom
bad,I would not work for them again unless they get a better person to manage the store in a professional manner. Other people that were my managers were very good with us.
bad,"Needed emergency family days for personal matters and lack of daycare and was denied. But because I was already in the union they couldn't fire me .. Did not I form me of this and treated me unfairly until I quit. Also, the store manager never consulted with my department head to even see if the time off was possible. And would not allow me to speak to my department head."
bad,"The store allowed advancement but the union kept people in positions that should not be allow to be in those areas for safety, customer service and reliability that prevented advancement in several situations.  Union protected the wrong people and could not opt out when they did not protect you as a newer employee vs one that had been there longer."
bad,I was told the low wage was because of the amount of health coverage we would receive...Safeway would pay for it all. It sounded good  except when it was supposed too come in it didnt.
bad,"Safeway was my first job.  As a first job, I would say it isn't that bad, but I feel trapped there.  The hours are extremely inconsistent, and the store manager doesn't really make scheduling a priority, they would randomly assign everyone in the various departments. This lead to a lot of issues, such as gaps in coverage during peak hours or no lunch coverage which then had to be made up by the employees working extra hours.  Although the extra hours were not unwelcome, it felt as if the managers just didn't care about their mistakes and didn't really take responsibility, even though part of their job was to create and approve the schedule."
bad,it was fast face with a lot of work to do at once to much for one person to handle. worked overtime way to much and got in trouble for working over time. always something new adding on to are jobs with less time. decent manager who worked there when I worked at the time. always do this do that by this time.
bad,"At the location I worked at, the store was busy during the holidays and the weekends since it was close to the Mexican border. Parents would let children run around the store, when they make a mess the parents won't say anything and this sort of thing happened a lot. The boss doesn't have a good reputation, the people I worked with would say he doesn't know how to socialize and he acts cold to everyone, no one is sure how he got his position in the first place."
bad,"Safeway is a very good company to work for. Great hours, pay rate & days off. I get along just great with my co workers, I love dealing with customers on a daily bases. I go above & beyond to help out my co workers, customers, I stay over time when asked."
bad,"Manager come and go so I never really had a good store manager. I had a great supervisor at the front end in Scotts Valley California when I was a GMC. I worked in the Floral department. I pretty much ran that department even though I was not the manager. Worked in the bakery, GMC and did whatever the manager ask me to do.  I work at Safeway for over 5 years and the management was terrible."
bad,"not a place you want to stay to long, unlikable job with weird coworkers  and garbage pay. good news is that they are always hiring, they might jump through some hoops to hire you as well, considering no one wants to work there."
bad,"At the start I was quite hopeful for this job but after a few months in night crew I got very frustrated with the management. Despite me writing that I was only able to work 2-3 shifts a week they'd often give me 4-5 and with awful hours they knew I didn't have a car and still scheduled me in for 11-3am so I'd be stranded in the worst part of town in the middle of the night. Management would often be upset if we didn't get other people's jobs done for example one morning we told the manager that we had finished the grocery order but weren't able to finish the bread then she scowled at us. The department I worked in only had 3 people so if anyone needed time off if you weren't working the expectation was you were to come in. They promised me a better position as well but kept me on night crew too which was frustrating. Everything was broken in the back as well. One of my last days all three pallet jacks were broken and two of those had been broken for weeks without repair or even a promise of repair. "
bad,I have work at Safeway for almost 8 years and still cant get anything close to full time hours and there are still tons of hour cuts and not enough staff to run the store
bad,"The job is not hard at all. Most locations give you the opportunity to advance and cross train if you like. At my store, management was the problem. The store director micromanaged and constantly wanted you to go above and beyond your duties (completing tasks in other departments) but did not want to compensate you for it. I was utilized in four different areas in the store (cashier, customer service clerk, manager, inventory control clerk) to be a team player and help out the store. I was taken advantage of, the company only cares about the bottom line. They do not care about you or any family/life issues that you have going on."
bad,"came in and bagged groceries and stocked shelves, pretty emotionless job with easy hours and easy mobility. i dont know what else to say this website is making me type longer"
bad,This job is for young people not for college grads for people in there 40 to 70. To get stab in the back almost ever weak. You get yelled at if you did not if you did not finish your work or and get a bad review from a customer.
bad,"Poor management who is unwilling to assist with cashiering. Angry customers due to lack of cashiering. They want you to skip school to work for them. They have lack of security. Any one can get away with stealing money or items. I have been a victim of harassment and although the person was fired, he is aloud in the store where he will say more threats to me."
bad,"My job was to monitor a apartment complex, the job was not safe for females to work alone. Manage was not helpful and often was hard to talk to. Very un professional."
bad,hours are not great not enough employees scheduled people always complaining its very toxic because everyone is out to get everyone. the more you know the more used and abused you are!!!!
bad,"standing for 8 hours two ten minutes and 1 hour lunch. the ten minute ""breaks"" are useless because once your on the ten minutes you dont want to go back to work its almost better not to have the breaks and just keep work"
bad,Safeway is a good place to work but its a very stressful place to work. I was a Night crew lead and if my crew and I didn't complete the tasks that needed to be done. I always in trouble. I takes about 1 and a half hours to finish 1 pallet and on average 11 pallets will be delivered.
bad,I was a checker for almost 9 years at Albertsons they closed my store took a transfer to Safeway as a fuel attendent and didnt care for that position I wad responsible for locking up the fuel station and counting the till and cleaning the gas pumps and emptying the trash mopping and sweeping the floors and above all customer service
bad,"It was stressful everyday at the job. Very dirty in the back of the store, behind the store where the pallets were dropped off and in the bathrooms. Rat infested"
bad,"Safeway was my first job and it where I gained my work experience. I am very appreciative of all the experience I gained working with this company. Once Safeway got taken over by Albertsons, many things changed and I felt as though the changes were making negative impact on the company."
bad,From working at Safeway I endured a great deal of bullying and a lot of unprofessional behavior. I reported a problem that was promised to be taken care of and it wasn't.
bad,"Always worked long hours, because i wanted to advance. When you finally advance there are longer hours. They want you to do the work of three people, and never give enough hours to departments."
bad,"Understaffed in order to stay in budget, so employees are worked pretty hard, with long hours. Sometimes hard to complete all the work that needs to be done within your shift, however if you stay over to complete the work, you will get in trouble for doing overtime. As well as you will get in trouble if the works not done, so it's a lose lose situation."
bad,ok so I had started working here to work in starbucks but within the first two months I was moved and trained in at least 3 other departments.  not a great place to work
bad,"A typical day the moment you clock in, your supervisor is breathing down your neck to do something another department should have done hours prior. Once that was done your supervisor will force you to go outside to perform cart duties when there was easily only 4-6 carts no where near the store while there is a rush."
bad,Cashier job can be tough due to large rushes of customers at certain times of day. Most of the workers are polite and understanding. Job environment will depend on quality and personality of the managers which seem to vary as I had one head manager and two assistant managers. Hours tend to be six to eight hour shifts with a half hour break. Each time of the day has its pros and cons. There is no actual enjoyable part of the job.
bad,"Great starting positions for the high school student. Nothing worth staying for, unless you come from dual incomes, don't pay your own bills, or you need steady medical insurance."
bad,"Safeway Canada was a great place to work prior to the takeover by sobeys,it was fast paced,productive and the employee management relationship was tops."
bad,"Terrible, incompetent management trickles down, and without that, it can quickly turn into a chaotic, hostile environment. The job wasn't necessarily, but it was demeaning and soul-crushing. The only reason to stick around is for the chance to be promoted, but that carrot can only be dangled in front for so long. The best part is all based on chance, and that's co-workers. Unfortunately, I had to deal with a lot of hostile and unfriendly ones, or some that were even unwilling to work. What I learned was the basic operation entailed in the job(pump and till operations, customer service), and I learned them quick. Past that point it was really a test of how much the managers could shirk off onto me and see how long I'd last before I'd crumple."
bad,Working for safeway was like wrestling an inflatable alligator pool toy. 9 times out of 10 you end up drowning while everyone watches. Blah blah blah blah
bad,"I worked at Safeway for less than a year, in that time I was able to work my way into becoming one of the bookeepers. Although I enjoyed my job, It is retail work, therefore you have to have an open schedule to get good hours. I felt the pay was low and the benefits weren't that great. There are really no incentives and if there are, you don't make enough to utilize them, who can go to Disneyland on minimum wage? Overall, I am grateful they hired me, they helped me get back into the workforce."
bad,The store I worked in was operated on a favourtism basis. If you excelled it did not matter unless you were one of the store managers favourites.  They do not hire for full time
bad,"Working at Safeway as a courtesy clerk is very hard work for me because of the physical part of it.It is getting too much for me.I have to push a lot of carts and lift very heavy items, and sometimes clean nasty messes in the rest rooms."
bad,"Managers change every 6 months and change the way things were done, because they don't know the store.  Some do not know how to manage employees, just customers"
bad,Working at Safeway is interesting because it feels as if the managment dosen't really respect their workers. To a new employee it would seem that they care more about earning money then their employee's respect and trust.
bad,"Was an awesome place to work at until the merge and plant slowed down. Even though management is horribly its still a good place because you'll hardly see any of them, like 10 minutes per 10 hours shift sometimes none at all. But do love the four ten shifts though."
bad,"Before albersons took over, I would have recommended working at safeway for those who are looking to gain experience.I believe it was a great first job for anybody. I currently would only recommend working for safeway if you need a temporary job. the co workers are great but the management and company have really gone down hill. the work place and environment is sad and depressing. this company's main and sole focus is money...not employees. we are nothing and easily disposable i feel."
bad,"As a cashier, your job is the be the last thing the customer sees as they leave. You need to send them off feeling great about their choice of shopping location and the desire to come back. A typical day at Safeway as a checker involves helping customers check out, find products, and answer any questions they have. I greatly enjoyed the interaction and helping people. "
bad,Horrible scheduling no life and management treats employees unfairly . Do not ever work here. They will not appreciate hardworking people.
bad,Can be a great place to work! But it all comes down to the management team that is in the stores. There are so great people working for the company.
bad,I had this job towards the end up my senior year in high school. At the time I was devoting all my time towards working at Safeway but whenever it came to requesting graduation day off a month in advance my manager wasn't willing to give me those days off.
bad,"overall a good work environment.good team work and fair management.i unloaded trucks ,stocked store items /products..busy through out work period."
bad,"My biggest gripe with the deli management was that they often changed the schedule without notice, and often within 2-3 days of the shift that was changing. Since they have no way to view the schedule online, they wanted me to come into work as many times as possible simply to check the schedule. Another thing is that I saw many people get fired a few days before their probation period of 3 months was up."
bad,"Provided a high level of customer service and practice safe food handling procedures. Prepared food, offer samples, and recommend products to customers. Properly weight, bag, price and cooked deli merchandise. Operated scales, slicers, wrapping and cooking equipment. Maintained a clean and sanitized work area including the maintenance of tables, walls, floors, display cases, walk-in coolers/freezers, fryers and other cooking equipment."
bad,Manager was an absolute horror . . turns out leadership knew about this person who felt that employees were her property and because we were oncall she could monopolize employee personal anytime she felt like it.
bad,This job workers are amazing but top management is very rude and put down there employees. Other then that The company in all is great.
bad,Much more advance planning was needed and a single course of action needed.  The process was begun long before the merger was finalized so nothing was able to be solidified cause redoing of plan variations over and over with no workable plan ever being developed.
bad,I worked part of the time in the deli and the other part in the Starbucks. They company cut hours back really low so in Starbucks I was usually scheduled to work alone for a 7 hour shift. In the deli there was usually at least one other person to help out until about 7pm.
bad,"This is my first union job and the hours you get are based on seniority and production needs. You get sent home to give a senior associate their hours, you get called off for a day, you get called in, you can not even get a second job because of this."
bad,"Bagging items, helping people to their cars, collecting carts and baskets, returning unwanted item to the shelves, clean up spills or messes."
bad,"I would get to work a few minutes early to make sure my station was clean stocked and ready to have all I need for 3-4 hours straight. I learned that there are lot of different positions in a grocery. I got to hang/change tags, stocked shelves and explore the dairy department as well as the back stock area. Management is in need of learning how to delegate hourly shift managers do their own work not put it on hourly employees. The co-workers work well together. The hardest part of the job is listening to all gossip from co-workers. My enjoyable part of this job was the customers who came in that I learned a lot from and about them. It gave me an edge to learn what these customers thought would give them a better store experience."
bad,"Great employees and customers, the location of the store was not good so I personally learned how to multi task and switch gears as fast as I could."
bad,Hard to get raises and advances. Dealing with customers is okay depending on the customer. Pretty good workout as a courtesy clerk as you walk and run around a couple miles a day.
bad,hardest part of the job is when you have so little time to do something that takes hours to complete to management expectations
bad,After working nine years and 2 months I find my self in failed Safeway transfer where I'm stuck at my old store where they are find way to fired because I make too much money.
bad,a typical day at work consists of a 4-8 hour shift of standing up front and helping customers get checked out as fast as we can. I have learned a lot here and met a lot of people but I am starting to get frustrated with management and the overall unprofessional atmosphere there. There is too much childish gossip and when it comes to the safety of employees I feel like we are punished if we bring attention to it. (I closed a lot and had multiple problems). The only enjoyable thing about this job was getting to know a few coworkers and getting regular customers. I love connecting with them all. 
bad,"Anything and everything that needed to be done I did, and if I didn't know how to do it, I learned very quickly."
bad,Its a job. Its not very enjoyable but I try and make the most out of it. Im just ready to move on with my life and find a new job.
bad,This is a good place to work if you are in highschool or if you need some money or work badly.
bad,"most of the management was bad. If they didn't like you they would do what they could to get rid of you. I never had any infractions while there, then got turned into security for using a second free coupon for a sandwich(apparently we could only use 1). I was able to work at store for 3-4 more weeks then after coming back from maternity leave, was let go. Never got a write up or suspension. work wasn't bad. some managers don't tell you what they expect of you, you just need to read minds."
bad,"If you dont mind working every weekend, every holiday this is the job for you. Long hours and dont care about ones family life. Need tomorrow off? Well if it doesnt fit in the needs of the business your working kinda place."
bad,"I had been working for Safeway for about three months when I mysteriously stopped getting my pay checks. I approached my store manager about the issue on a weekly basis and after a month the issue still hadn't been resolved. I resigned, since what's the point in working if you're not getting paid? A week later I received my overdue pay checks with a retroactive pay raise applied, so they did eventually resolve the issue, but a week too late."
bad,Supervisor was very hostile to employees. The work was very physical. There was always a lay off list.
bad,"Safeway was, once upon a time, a cool place to work with a strong union. Then albertsons bought them out and it all went south. Terrible management, inconsistent job duties, minimum wage pay for a mountain of constant work, and a general lack of consideration for upward mobility."
bad,Hours were extremely limited. An exhausting environment to work in with not a whole lot of energy at all whatsoever. Would only get about 12-15 hours a week if lucky.
bad,"Safeway is a highly Diverse work place. I used to work 16-24 hrs as management. This job is only good as a start up job. Should not be considered as a permanent  job for life if you have a degree. "
bad,"A typical day of work starts by entering the deli department and washing your hands. Usually you are given basic tasks by the managers or told second hand by your co-workers and try to balance completing your task and assisting customers in the deli area."
bad,Working at Safeway was energizing as well as exhausting. The people were fun and nice to be around but the work was somewhat boring. It was pretty tedious and and the management wasn't great.
bad,"The only time i enjoyed my time is when i had a constant flow of people, standing in front of a clock all day was killer. I was part time and only worked closing."
bad,"Safeway doesnt really care about the employees. I would work double shifts to cover for someone who called in. Sometimes I would work more than 12 hour days. As soon as I needed some time off for medical reasons i started losing hours. "
bad,"I worked at Safeway for over 3 and a half years and they barely paid me more than minimum. I think I got two small raises. Treated poorly, hours used as negotiation tool."
bad,People hate their jobs are rude dont care im sexually harassed by customers and no one did anything and im a minor. Manager is rude to me its mentally exhausting i dont reccomend this job if your are mentally hanicop becathey will deatroy your spirit.
bad,overall good first job nothing more. would only recommend as a first or temporary job other than that it isn't a place you want to stay long or as a career.
bad,"I worked for one year at Safeway cycling through various duties and titles and i can tell you it was quite possible the most stressful year of my life."
bad,"Since it was purchased by Sobeys in 2013 it has gone downhill, and instead of caring about people, they only care about their bottom line."
bad,"Production standards too high, management doesn't really know what they're doing. Everyone hates working there but the money's good enough so they stay. I was lied to in my interview, I have 5 years of forklift expierance and I was told it would take 2 years to get to a lift position when in reality it takes 10+ years, I wouldn't have accepted the job if I knew it took that long."
bad,In the nearly 10 years i have worked there I have consistently watched the hours be cut as the expectation of work needing to be done rise. its an unrealistic ratio and it is only getting worse
bad,Safeway was a better company before Albertsons got their hooks into it. The smaller chains take better care of their employees. You will have increased responsibility but will take an act of God to get compensated correctly. Management will pit crew against each other to meet unrealistic sales goals.
bad,"There is near zero communication between upper management and lower management, which results in the store manager constantly getting angry at the wrong people for the wrong things."
bad,"Stressful disrespectful work place. On call. Huge job sites 2 small job sites. New crew almost everyday. Only if a Forman that abused their power doesnt put u down heel keep u "
bad,Bad Experience for me it was my first  real job certain days I will call for my time they would give me a wrong time to come in or sometimes they wouldn’t let me know my times to come in at all so it would make me look like a bad person im not a bad person I love to work
bad,"Recent Albertson's acquisition of Safeway has felt less labor friendly."
bad,"Always told to ""step up my game in my department"".  Could never accomplish that due to being called to the cash register for half of my shift.  Expectations were super high for not being able to supervise my area."
bad,this job helped me gain great customer service skills. i value this experience as it has helped me get other jobs. this job has long hours and can be pretty exhausting schedule wise.
bad,"The first few months of the job were nice. It was fairly simple and I was good at it. They decided to cut my hours by more than half of what I was getting. I have bills I need to pay, and 10-15 hours won’t cut it."
bad,"Days were not bad until later in the day when they would send up to half the crew home thus causing the rest to do the work of 2-3 people. Managements hands were tied in these decisions, so it was hard to blame them. The benefits were adequate and fair."
bad,"The job is pretty much common sense however it is very routine and requires great time management. Corporate requires a HUGE amount of work done in each shift from each employee with only a small amount of time given and that time seems to be cut more and more each week, but the programs and new policies seem to be added. This makes it for a VERY stressful work environment. Corporate claims that the ""customer"" always comes ""first"" however....they seem to want their ""charts"" and ""production logs"" filled out as a priority when they come in for inspections, not accepting that customers take time."
bad,"Working as a combo clerk for Vons was a very stressful environment with unfriendly employees and an uncooperative management. I love to be challenged and take upon any job that offers competitive pay. I'm a very determined, motivated, and a very hard worker. This position at Vons nearly killed me though with stress and low pay, not being able to pay for bills or buy myself food. I was told to do things outside of my certification and job description which not only violated OSHA, but the companies policies as well. I did not receive pay for clocking over to higher paying positions nor did I receive any help from the cooperate offices for Safeway. I had to contact HR just to have some things made different at Vons."
bad,A typical day at Safeway was fast pace very stressful. I learned that some people in management need to take classes to help them be a better manager and worked better with their employees. The workplace culture. The hardest part was being rush to complete customers orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and working with some nice co-workers
bad,"While I felt that the demands of the job at it's core was not a problem for me, my time working at Safeway was plagued by unprofessional behavior on the behalf of my coworkers and managers and a lack of support that made the job harder than it needed to be."
bad,"It's a very rough environment that feels similar to high school. Unprofessional, and difficult to get request approved. Management struggles with needs of employers."
bad,"The grocery industry has dramatically throughout the past decade. When Wal-Mart entered the scene, everything changed. "
bad,"Customers were great and friendly, manager was not very supportive. Shifts were very inconsistent and did not like the late Friday night shifts followed by the early Saturday morning shift"
bad,"I had a great time working with and getting to know my coworkers and managers, but the job itself is soul crushing. its just complete boredom broken up every now and then by a customer complaining to you. Loved the people tho..."
bad,1st time job that you start out of move on from and grow from. Not exactly the ideal place to work as they do not like paying employees for the positions and departments they work in
bad,the management was terrible. managers will be rude and disrespectful towards the employees. hours constantly being cut. the communication between the management and employees is terrible. everyone should be treated equally and fairly. management should be more attentive to how they are speaking to their employees.
bad,"safeway ruins you soul, no consistent schedule one week at a time. makes it impossible to make a plans or schedule things. does not pay well unless you have worked there for years"
bad,Not a great career path at all. As an employee I felt resented by management because I was a member of a union. I was not a member by choice. This was a union shop. Because we were organized against the company I felt like I was being set up all of the time to be fired.  If you have the intention of moving into management I saw this to be highly stressful for people. This is a business that operates on a 1-2% margin and if your store does not perform your future is in doubt. I did apply for several other positions at the company but could never advance. But then again I never made lots of friends within the company.
bad,"worked early mornings , a lot of things needed to be done like breaking down the the daily load and working the product out. The management was a little poor, any problems that needed to be solved or dealt with by management never got done. Workplace culture was alright as long as you were nice to your fellow co workers"
bad,I worked in the deli. My first day and it was bad. Nats and flies all over the place. It took me about a week of cleaning to get a hold of that probelm and control it.
bad,The management was very passive and let toxic employees control the workplace and gave priority to those who were inconsistent rather than the daily employees.
bad,it was fine at sometimes but others it's hard to keep up with they are askin you to do. But that's when you have to try harder to keep your manager happy so you can get more hours. But some managers you have to be careful with.
bad,Really do not care to say anymore don't really know what to say.its making me fill this out and I want to be done with this . I don't care to write anything more
bad,"The management was unfair and made rude comments. For example they favorited people in the workplace. It was fast paced and busy, the customers were okay, sometimes rude."
bad,"not enough hours, needs more pay, and need more people who actually care about the opportunity they are given. the work is easy, but safeway is too laid back, and lets things slide"
bad,"every safeway/sobeys is different so cant really be all too biased, they all have there short comings and benefits, hours are always terrible unfortunately"
bad,"For the time that I worked here, there were both good and bad moments. My coworkers were all nice people who were willing to lend a hand if you needed it, and they were easy to get along with; the same could be said of our direct manager. Unfortunately, a lot of the equipment we needed to do our job was so old that it was either near-obsolete or completely broken. Our manager did what he could to get things for us, but he was unable to get most of what we needed without the go ahead from his own superiors, who often had no clue about our situations."
bad,"I didn't really like safeway but it also was a really long time ago, just didn't get paid enough and did't like the culture of it in all honesty but oh well."
bad,"This job was great. I liked it alot. "
bad,"Provide customer service fulfilling customer orders, cashiering, and cooking serving food. Answer customer questions, placing orders, and preparing orders. I learned how the grocery industry works. My dept. manager was nice. Often understaffed and overworked. Being understaffed. Most enjoyable was working with the public. I enjoy working the public."
bad,"Manager at Poulsbo, WA Safeway is highly unreliable and has been reported for harassment as well. Fast paced CS which is great for those who need fast work."
bad,the Managers have us clean the wall that was or duty. We work hard for the Safeway.It was not appreciate about of the work.It was not good management at work
bad,"Management could be good or bad depending on the person. The company as a whole seems to squeeze as much work for as little pay as possible from employees. Overall, not a company that I would recommend to most who want to make a career out of something they enjoy."
bad,it was very fast pace you had to keep it neat also the customers was too ready the store stayed clean and managers supervise all worker to make sure the job was being done
bad,"I handled all of the ordering and marketing for the floral department at this particular store.  I also did floral design for customers upon request and filled the coolers with ready-to-go bouquets daily.  My manager was a tool, to put it mildly, and had it not been for him I would've stayed there longer."
bad,"Oh for how by toil's sweat, we raced"
bad,"Easy job mostly includes packaging, labeling, writing on cakes, keeping sales floor stocked, taking special orders, cleaning, and helping customers. I learned about all the different breads, pastries, and desserts that we carry. The workplace culture is very lacking in motivation mostly due to poor management. There were many harrassement issues that were ignored and/or dismissed by management usually in a very unprofessional manner. The enviroment was hostile, unorganized, and always stressful due to having unqualified supervisors in charge. The most enjoyable part of the job was writing on cakes and adding decorative touches. The hardest part was dealing with an unprofessional supervisor who had no regard for food safety and personally attacked/harrassed the employees and created a very distractng work enviroment."
bad,"I had to go our and retrieve carts, as well as put them away neatly back in their holders. Also, I had to make sure that the customers were all content with their shopping as well as having all of their questions answered"
bad,"During my time at Safeway, it was painfuly obvious to me that the common worker was the lowest priority for the store, with pay being locked at minimum wage ( even for those with experience in their field) and advancement being a rare occurence."
bad,went to school at Moscow high and after school started work at 4pm. till 10pm or midnight I stocked shelves helped customers bagged groceries ect...  good place to work and got to meet lots of new people
bad,my typical day at work was getting to work on time. Getting things set up at the cash register Cleaning around my work place . stocking shelves is needed stocking drinks the ends of the register. scanning produce and merchandisers  customer service .what I learned is that you learn from your mistakes and you can fix them working with people that have different views of things.
bad,"Store manager is not a good manager, he has the attitude that you lead by intimidation. I know of.only 3 people in store who like manager.  If you like being yelled at,  belittled "
bad,"The people I worked with in the bakery were great, everyone else, not so much. The store manager had no idea how a bakery was ran and would set ridicules deadlines for us and would nag as like we weren't doing anything when we were working our tails off. Then the CEOs' would throw need product at us, with no place to put them. Would take away popular items, with no warning and tried to make every store be the exact same and not always care what the customer liked."
bad,"It was a great stepping stone in my career, but making less than minimum wage was not paying the bills. Perfect for someone in school, they had a program that paid for continued education."
bad,"I enjoyed working here, I received training in other departments and I loved my return customers. However, when alberstons took over it was terrible!!"
bad,"A typical day at work for me includes making freshly brewed coffee, specialty drinks and preparing and stocking the snack case for the customers convenience. Making customers smile and happy about their purchase makes me happy that i'm doing a good job at what I do. I also clean and bus tables, stock the condiment area and upsell merchandise."
bad,"I worked in the deli and although there were occasional ""difficult"" customers it was often more stressful than necessary. The level of professionalism in this department was not up to par and it ended up not a good fit for me."
bad,"Management was bad, The hours were good the people I worked with where bad. I like working there.lived a hundred feet away."
bad,"Granted, the store I worked at was known in town as the ""ghetto Safeway"", but that doesn't mean that management had to accept that fact. Every day, I learned about some new disaster that occurred the night before, like the Coinstar breaking for the millionth time or a broken shelf that was hilariously repaired with duct tape. The store chain, however, has faults that expand beyond my store. Management is often hit-and-miss, the supposedly-flexible schedules become more concrete as you progress, and corners are frequently cut in order to save a penny. No wonder Albertsons had to buy the chain, because it's obvious Safeway wouldn't have lasted without them."
bad,"As Audit senior completed various assignments at clients "
bad,Safeway does not value long term employees and most recently has had very limited to no advancement. They were recently acquired by Albertsons INC and many corporate employees lost their jobs. Since then the company has made numerous changes to policies more than once and communication down to store level has suffered.
bad,"It is a shame to admit that I quit, but I did.  Safeway isn't a horrible company, but it is so far back in times it is ridiculous.  Also, the stress level on all managers except the store manager is infuriating.  Most store managers do not get down and dirty when needed and often put the work load on their lessers, which is a decent attribute when managing, but most people these days need to learn how to be a leader rather than a boss or manager.  Very few store managers know how to do this, and this trait is fading quickly.  My advice, do not seek long time employment with this company.  Most people are back stabbing and will step on you the chance they get."
bad,"Working grocery is never fun, unless your an unrealistic happy person that loves listening to the public whine and complain because they cant figure out how to find something in a place where everything is labeled as to what it is and how much it costs."
bad,"Safeway was a great opportunity me, I've learned how to become a team player and a leader. I would say management was not very organized and need more of improvement. Working here is not very hard the only complaint I have is when I had to close alone."
bad,"Safeway is a good working area but a hard job, always lots of things to do with little time for breaks. I would have stayed there if I wasn't planning on moving up to Tahoe."
bad,It was ok a typical day would start out slow and get busy. I would get carts and do the same thing everyday there. I didnt like it there as what I thought it would be like. I would ask the managers there every single day if I could do something else and they just say i need to focus on courtesy. Its a great first job but they are not the kind of people I thought they were when being interviewed.
bad,It was cool when I first started but some co workers had an attitude when it came to training and the bakery manager is two faced and talks about everybody.she talks to people like they her kids. And I refuse to deal with that so I left.
bad,"hectic workplace full of unorganized managers causing chaos for employees. heavy traffic flow of consumers with a lack of patience due to the short staff. its fun being as though i work in the Starbucks kiosk therefore i don't experience the the reactions the grocery clerks receive. the hardest part of my job is when i have to inform customers that we don't offer some of the drinks a corporate starbuck's has on the menu. the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to try and sample out to customers all of our different drinks. the typical day at work consists of heavy volume providing	quality beverages, whole bean, and food products consistently for all customers by adhering to all recipe and presentation standards."
bad,"As a front end manager, I am scheduled 10 to 7.  I do not mind working at 10 because it allows me to go to the gym every morning.  Every morning, I go to the gym between 5:45 to 8; going to the gym is a great commitment to me."
bad,"I worked for the Pharmacy as a pharmacy technician. Now, don't get me wrong...majority of management is great...work/life balance is decent and they're really flexible...BUT, be careful to NOT devote yourself to much, because in the end you will receive no appreciation. See, I floated for the company...now I did that willingly but, I would volunteer to pick up extra shift at a moments notice, it didn't matter where I'd be going, I always said, just give me a call and I'll be there...cause to a point, I put my dedication to the company before everything...including family...and my car...just to be there when they needed someone. So much that, now before I dive into it...I volunteered to go to Mammoth Lakes, CA for the company. The first year I was like awesome a working type vacation during the snow season...Did that for three years...this past year (2013)...the company had TWO employees (one technician and one clerk) put in their two week notice at the same time right before the snow season was to start. Now, knowing the company would be in a bind to find employees at a short notice to relocate there or even hire new and train...I volunteered to fill in at a moments notice. So, I temporary relocated myself and my family up there for two and a half months...we stayed in a hotel room with two queen size beds with a small kitchenette....no stove, just microwave and small fridge....for a little over two months...It took them two months to find replacement staff there not only to add we were away from family during the holidays...sometimes working 7days a week for 12hrs a day...After"
bad,"I worked at safeway for almost a year and it was just fine. With the exception of the corrupt management. If they didn't like you, you found out very soon. I enjoyed my job, but I was constantly under the gun with everything. Always watching everything I did. They constantly asked me if I wanted to leave just so they wouldn't have to go through the process of firing me. They tore me down. Everything else about the store is fine. The atmosphere, the service, the quality food, ect."
bad,"An  ok environment, but many coworkers acted as if it was high school and behaved like children. Low pay, and management will screw you over if given the chance."
bad,Really forcibly fast paced simple duties.  must always be doing something.  apart from break there is no down time.  Expects you to be able to package food while catering to customer needs and janitorial duties while also putting the packaged food in its rightful place.
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of waiting on patients, answering phones and entering prescriptions while receiving a large medication order from the vendor and maintaining the Inventory. I became very knowledgeable in the classes of medications, medications names, strengths, SIG's, side effects, uses and interactions. I also became familiar with a variety of insurance companies and their coverage's. A shift would consist of being under pressure, multi-tasking and non-stop running until you left.  The benefits were wonderful and being part of a union was rewarding."
bad,"I got in before everything went south, so my pay and benefits were pretty good. New employees would be better of working somewhere else. Grocery used to be a good place to make ok money per hour, and really good benefits for your whole family- the values have changed and so have the employees."
bad,"typical work day consisted of clocking in getting on the register and meeting new people. Checking them out , asking about their day or any questions that made them feel appreciated and thanking them by the name on their receipt. I learned people can be so difficult it took me a long time to understand that when people challenge my knowledge i shouldnt give them a run for their money. Coworkers are always kind. Management to me were lenient in a way but also difficult and not understanding. Honestly i never knew who i was gonna meet so really the most enjoyable part was the nice people i met throughout the day."
bad,"Work life balance is horrible, continuously cutting labor"
bad,Loved working with employees but upper management needs to not look at employees like their towns folk.
bad,it is great work enviorment to work in
bad,"a typical day at work would be to open up,serve starbucks drinks,work the register.management was like either they liked you or they didnt.racial.my co workers were awesome,the hardest part of the job was nothing.the most enjoyable was working with the public."
bad,management was always on point very organized environment was very delightful to be in the only problem was the hrs. that they would give me instead of giving me 35 to 40 hrs. a week for my fulltime position I would only receive 4-15hrs a week.
bad,I've worked at this location for a few years and the worst part of the job was the deli department manager and her snobby attitude. You'll never hear that you've done a good job. You'll never do enough work and her tone of voice and neediness to talk about herself is sickening. There's some good staff that has come and gone. It's not so bad making salads and trays. Ready to eat items are okay but the order is not fun.
bad,"High demand in productivity. "
bad,"Perhaps I'm just critical about the retail industry, but I was concerned with career opportunities once Albertsons bought out the company."
bad,"It's a good place to work, if you don't need money and want good benefits. Since the state is raising minimum wage you will NOT receive a raise, management will not fight for you to get the raises you deserve. It's unorganized you will be overworked and underpaid. On the plus side since they are desperate they will hire anyone and management is very flexible with schedules, but you have to keep an eye on your schedule because they will always mess it up."
bad,"I worked in the deli department that warned me right from the get-go during my interview of the high turnover rate in the deli department. I had to find out the hard way. Atleast 5 employees came and went just within the 1 Year I worked in that department, and one walked out! Management of the store and the deli is awful and I would never recommend that position."
bad,"Its a good first job, but like with most fast type places long term ends up becoming more displeasing. many of the employees have stopped caring about getting a good job done"
bad,Closing the department so hard and the managers only have the rookies do it. Some people have been there for 30+ years. The work is so hard and the pay is not worth it.
bad,"Safeway is a steady and often fast paced work environment that is union supported. You start at the bottom and have opportunities to work your way up into different positions but it is entirely dependant on management who are often unreliable, unreasonable or play favorites and discriminate both against races or persons."
bad,"Very sad place to work. I feel horrible for the ladies I worked with, mainly the night shift deli ladies. Hard work which is very unrewarding, the pay is awful and then they cut hours. I don't really know what else to say except they have gone down hill since they merged with Albertsons."
bad,Safeway treats you like slaves in the deli department. no one ever wants to help or even ask if we need help. They look and keep walking on by. Nothing is ever in order or stalked right.
bad,Safeway is only a good job if you cant find any other job to work at and or if you want to be treated like badly. They would rather save a few bucks then have someone help you on a shift. Would not recommend working there
bad,"Lazy union workers didn't want to move up but didn't want anyone else to either.  They filed a grievance when I, after less than 3 months of working there became the Back Door Receiving Clerk and Bookkeeper.  They did the same thing to my husband (we were hired at the same time) when he became the Deli Manager.   The Store Manager and the Assistant Store Manager were wonderful!  As management they cannot be part of the union and couldn't really do anything about employee behavior without going through the union first.  Unions were and still are good for somethings but, in my opinion, the UFSWC breeds lazy employees and created way too much drama for my liking."
bad,"I have heard about good safeways that people like working in, but the store I was at was not one of those. The District manager did not authorize our department to transfer in more staff to help, but tripled our workload. We could not keep any new staff because the workload was too intense for anyone who got hired, and it also took a toll on all of the current workers in my department. The branch and department managers requested to promote me to help with the under-staffing issues, but it was denied by upper management because I was only 21 at the time. They try their best to not give anyone sick pay, and the stress was so intense it caused many of my coworkers to have mental breakdowns, anxiety attacks, and develop stress disorders. After I quit (to save my own mental health) I had to take a year off work for therapy and healing. I have heard from some of my former coworkers that the location I worked at still has not improved."
bad,"The Manager, often, followed his whims and made some impractical (and legall troublesome) edicts whilst I was employed there.  The Deli was fantastic; I was not so enthused about the conditions or products of the Safeway Bakery"
bad,I have nothing good to say about Safeway. All the employees are miserable...  I met a lot of good people there but they were all very unhappy with management.
bad,At first I was put in Starbucks and I told them this was my first job ever and they said I wasn't feeling it and I only gave me four hours and said they didn't want me anymore. Then I was a courtesy clerk for five months and that was alright and then I was moved to bakery. At first I was the packager which was alright and then as I multi tasked I started baking and doing other duties. I am always productive but this job becomes very stressful. They never increase your pay rate like a co worker worked at Starbucks and only makes $12 which is two dollars over min. Also Safeway never shows appreciation for how much work you do they keep wanting more. They will literally drain you and make you feel like your nothing. They will say don't do overtime but will want you to get everything done with isn't possible because the list of objectives never ends. Also if you work in a department you can never request days off. I got five people in bakery and me getting a day off I want is impossible. Overall its a decent job for starters and can cover some bills but not the best job out there or very reliable.
bad,A typical day at work as a bakery clerk consisted of providing customer service to the public and handling inventory in the department. The management and culture of this grocery store was the best part of the job. It was a very friendly and supportive environment. The hardest part of the job was that only one person handled multiple tasks at once during closing shifts. I learned that the grocery/food industry is a fast paced environment but much fun to work in.
bad,"Working here was stressful and lack luster. Management was terrible at their jobs. Very chaotic due to not having enough employees. Hours were never there, 16 hour work weeks. Only saving grace were the coworkers."
bad,Great company to work for as an union employee. Salaried employees benefits and responsibilities have changed dramatically over the last few years. Customer service is important part of any position.
bad,Will put you in an environment hazardous to your health repeatedly without a second thought. Expect hours to be to low to pay the rent. Everyone is either on food stamps or has another job. They will keep hiring for your position and cu you from 15 hours a week to 8. At minimum wage that's not enough for anything. I have been there over 2 years and have never gotten a raise.
bad,"Political environment, everyone looking after themselves in Management. Fast paced, reduced hours, but still had to make payroll with restrictions on overtime and hours allocation, caused many to cheat the system. Most Managers worked 50-70 weekly."
bad,Always had to be on your feet. Time goes fast due to constantly working. Hardest part of the job is having to multi task with everything. Easiest part is that time goes fast.
bad,"I worked in the produce department, so experiences may vary."
bad,there was always a chance to advance and get more hours in . i liked how you were able to learn new things in different areas of the company . the workplace culture would vary on who is in charge of each department .
bad,I wish they took more consideration of their employees. When it's slow and they want to send you home and you say I'll go home. Then manager keeps you by saying no your cheap I need you. Then sends someone home who's topped out makes sense. But I really needed to be sent home with a swollen ankle to get checked out. Very rude. Found out I had an infection.
bad,Safeway is a good first time employee company. It is good if you are trying to build a resume and the job security is great! The job consists primarily just of pushing carts and stalking shelves.
bad,"bag and help customer with groceries. get karts for customers to shop. clean bathrooms and break rooms stock shelves, give customers samples , do go backs"
bad,"I didn't mind working here, I just had a bad experience. I had a very important surgery and my manager would not let me take time off for it. It was a good environment and I did learn a lot of customer service experience."
bad,As my first job it was an alright experience. I was let go however due to the fact I did not get the correct training and I did not know how to do some task. I asked how you do them and they were unable to show me the correct procedure.
bad,"Management is overworked and doesn't care about employees, training is minimum to none, and time management is okay. They won't work with a schedule and the turnover rate is high."
bad,"This was a good job starting out, although no hours, pay starts low. I think it's more fore retirees or kids coming out of school."
bad,Safeway is now owned by Albertsons.  Fastly closing all non productive stores.  Has placed a lot of people on unemployment.
bad,"I first walked in and was looking forward to working here. However, as weeks went by I found out my manager did not treat his employees very well which I believe is the reason why employees would walk out within five days after hire. For example, I was trained by one of my co-workers to close once then my very next night I was closing by myself from 5 until 10 pm when it specifically states for that specific store there are supposed to be atleast 2 closers for my department (seafood) My co-workers were really respectful and I enjoyed working with them."
bad,"Well... I worked for Safeway for 10 long years. The first year as a lowly courtesy clerk was alright. The next 4 however slowly deteriorated from alright to unpleasant to thank god I'm moving. As a courtesy clerk I was pushing carts, bagging groceries, helping customers, sweeping, cleaning up spills, and removing graffiti from bathroom stalls with hairspray, That was an interesting learning experience as hairspray actually breaks up ink and stuff! And of course cleaning bathrooms and the lunch room, and garbage's I got paid a maximum of $13.50 up from $11.17 in those five years. The 'benefits' were only available to people working 30 hours for 13 weeks on average. I got those benefits about 5 times. The benefits themselves started out decent. I got an air miles employee card which gave me just under 4000 air miles, that is until they stopped giving air miles as a benefit. Safeway benefits in my experience are not very good. Medical is a huge pain to try to use. Dental too. And that's about it. Other than pension of course. After I moved, I ended up working for Safeway again for 4 3/4 years. A new store, new people. It was so much better.. The atmosphere in that store was positive, and friendly. The work culture was very good. Not too serious. Staff could sing, joke, laugh. It was great! Mostly. In those years I was paid more than ever! Friends were to made everywhere too. The hardest part of working for Safeway as a courtesy clerk was doing the carts. The winters were brutal as there were 2-3 feet of snow. But those carts needed to be done. The hardest part in the last few years"
bad,"Coming into work to be expected to do work and other departments when working in front end and not feeling appreciated for my work. Learned how to handle customer issues and how to cashier. Management was not good, usually played favorites between employees. Co-works were either helpful or would do the least amount of work to get through the work day. Hardest part of job was dealing with reoccurring customer and co worker issues, while not feeling appreciated when hard work was done. Most enjoyable part of job was being able to make some friends among employees."
bad,"Was a good job before the strike.  Co-workers were great. Management pressed higher paid workers to quit or retire, and looked for any reason to fire them.  Management stressed, job highly stressful as a result."
bad,A typical day at work I show up take the temprature of all the food in the meat department. Then I serve customers fish and weight out prducts. To end each day I pack up the food case and spray everything down with the power washer.
bad,"When I started with the company it was a wonderful company to work for and everyone was proud to be an employee.  Over the years it has gone downhill severely and is no longer a company that any employee would say they are proud to work for.  All coworkers/employees are miserable, overworked with no help, constant pressure from corporate and upper management, and no added compensation or bonuses for hard work and extra responsibilities.  I would not recommend for anyone to apply."
bad,"Since I was in a specific department I wasn't needed too often in the other parts of the store. A normal day was actually pretty good being in Starbucks as I basically had to stay there all day it was almost like working for a different company. Management of the store itself was lacking heavily, and it seemed like something was always wrong or unfinished. My co-workers were all very friendly and made the day go smooth. The hardest part of my job specifically were my hours, they'd often change from working opening shifts to closing and everything between. The most enjoyable part was actually my department manager. He made the day go very quick and made it a pleasure to be there."
bad,Safeway is a great way for a young manager to learn the business.
bad,"The people that work there are nice but other than that its terrible, there are no discounts on the items in the store and they make you work your butt off."
bad,"Each day consisted of stocking shelves and running a point of sale system. The staff and clientele were friendly, benefits were decent though the wage was minimal. Scheduling was inconsistent and wage increase was based on time rather than performance."
bad,"Ive learned alot while being employed at Safeway for 1+ years. I went from a Cashier to a Frontend Manager/Teller after a couple of months. My work ethics is what got me to that position. But I think its time for me to move on and broaden my horizons, with a different career. I will be a soon graduate but I think that Safeway was great for while I was enrolled in school."
bad,Not enough room for advancement. Working overnights. Enjoyed the ability to work hard.
bad,"A fast paced business with some room for advancement.I learned much about ads and fixing of ad errors. Running a register and customer service, building displays for profit and the day to day needs of a large grocery store"
bad,"I had 17 yrs with the company and watched them go through change to stay competative...I did enjoy it when i was a clerk but being in management the story changes...Either you were liked or dislike as a manager and you were put against other managers, and the unrealistic goals are to much which means no life with family, as well as being oncall when ever you are called...alot of MICROMANAGING and no work life balance HYPOCRITS IS WHAT I SAY CORP, IS.....THEY DID ME A FAVOR AND I DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT CONSIDER THIS A GREAT PLACE TO WORK NOR GET INTO MANAGEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOU'LL BE DOOMED"
bad,"It's nice to have a union. The pay was pretty good. It's a lot of hard work. When I was there we worked a lot of overtime because we were so understaffed  and were working six days a week. Once, I worked 13 days straight."
bad,I didn’t enjoy working at safeway at all. I only enjoyed some of the people that worked there. The hours weren’t up to par and the job itself wasn’t very fun.
bad,"Great if you’re serious about the grocery business, loads of room for different experiences, room for growth if you’re willing to be molded into a corporate zombie."
bad,People would come in to buy alcohol and start a conversation with us which is entertaining as well to do our job. It’s stressing when it is really busy because we have to keep moving to make sure everything is set before we leave.
bad,Make more money for as hard as they work you  I feel like I never see my family cause I’m always at work. They don’t care about important things in your life
bad,"At the time , I believe they were going through a change of management . Department were low in staff and things were really unorganized. It was like you had to honestly go with the flow of the day ."
bad,was an okay job for a 14 year old kid grabbing carts and baskets and checking prices but the management was a nightmare and there was little to no organization
bad,the environment was ok considering it was downtown but my hours were horrible i only got paid for working 4 hours a week my hiring manager was vaping in my face
bad,"Working at safeway was alright, the manager was very generous with hours and my coworkers were kind and helpful. I would recommend working there if you're looking for a minimum wage job."
bad,Worked there for half a year and it was meh. People will talk to you like you're a priest in a temple ready to forgive anyone for their sins. A typical day was stand there for 8 hours and wait for your paycheck while people tell you their life story and crackheads harass you.
bad,This was my first fill time job and I worked as a Deli associate. Working the Deli was quite demanding and it required me to keep a clean workspace and deal with customers face-to-face.
bad,Needs consistent management with a professional approach to lead a fully productive and fairly ran store with potential for success for all. Lacks positive energy throughout every department.
bad,Like most retail its a lot of work for very little pay. Also they don't have very good work life balance. But it is at least consistent as far as day to day work tasks.
bad,Work is stressful and hectic because staff is spread thin with no coverage but management demands more be met than the on hand staff can provide. Management hires too many people and then still schedules bare minimum coverage leaving everyone with not enough hours to earn a live-able wage for the area. Not given enough hours to qualify for benefits. Inhospitable management style also means that customer care is not a focus despite the company promoting that. Good employees leave and those who remain are mistreated.
bad,"Job was just brutal, I remember. How hard I would work and I would feel like I got nothing done. It's a terrible. Feeling when. All you want to do is a good job. When this happens it gives you a give up mentality."
bad,I still work at Safeway for health benefits. It is very flexible and allows me to move forward on another career I am passionate about. I learned a ton of skills working for Safeway.
bad,Overall working there is kind of stressful depending on what you're doing but I wouldn't dissuade someone from applying here. It's a good start for working up in a department store
bad,"It's a good job if you're going to school. Other than that, there's little room for advancement. There getting rid of all the older employees and replacing with students to save money."
bad,I was a Deli Clerk for almost a year and the way they handle problems with employees is awful. Managers brush you off like your a nuisance and my experience in two different Safeway’s was the same. People are dishonest negative and spiteful if you are a hard worker in the deli. It’s extremely backwards but you’ll become a target if you one up people by being a hard worker.
bad,"Safeway was my first actual job, I loved it. I like how they are very helpful and they would like to help you grow within the company. I enjoyed my time there."
bad,This is not an enjoyable place to work. Workers are barely trained and management is incompetent. The hierarchy at this store is a mystery. This job was disgusting and there was no care for me or the other workers who had to spend hours outside in all weather bringing in carts.
bad,"Management isn't very helpful. It's a great first job but not really a career job unless you make friends with everyone. Customers are really rude most the time but it is a customer service job so you have to be nice no matter what. Hour constantly change. They don't stick to giving you days off that you request off even if you give them a reason as to why you can't work those days. They get mad if you call out most the time, even if you're sick. There is no way to avoid at least one person getting mad by you calling out, just make sure to do it at least 4 hours in advance. Don't expect any special treatment unless you're close to the management."
bad,"Good workers who know their worth don't stay long. Management and corporate take advantage of good workers who are willing to work extra hours and take on more responsibility than they are trained for. I was told I would only be stepping up as a shift manager for ""two weeks tops"" until they hired a new full time manager, and I ended up working as shift manager for months with out any pay raise or official promotion."
bad,I had zero problems with my manager in my specific department but the work load that they expect you to do in such a short amount of time is REDICULOUS!! There was absolutely no way that your able to get all of what they needed you to get done in such a little time.
bad,"I worked with alot of nice people who enjoyed there job and where they lived.i would stock shelves and face isles i worked night full time "
bad,Employees were underpaid. Management too often preferred to hire from outside instead of promoting within. Management sometimes lacked professionalism and decorum in the workplace.
bad,"Safeway:        "
bad,"If you have autism spectrum disorder, this job may find this job stressful if more ways than others expect. If you have trouble socializing with people, they will not bother to try socializing with you. Since this is a job where you will be working with others, you may notice little groups or ""factions"" of employees who stick together as friends. If you have autism spectrum disorder, you mat not be a part of any of that; this may turn out to be a stressful, isolating and depressing work experience for you."
bad,Meh. Benefits were not really there. The union was required and in highschool i really didnt need that. Plus the union provided well... nothing until just recently. Although the union probabl;y was able to leverage power as Safeway was losing money and power.
bad,"We are purposefully under staffed all the time. There are always lines. There is no self checkout. Breaks are 2 ten minutes for 8 hours and sometimes you don't get to take both breaks. Your break is being timed even while in line to buy food. So you have 30 seconds to eat. There are no lunches allowed in the front end schedule. Your start pay is minimum wage. You are hired as an APC which means that you will be scheduled in produce, deli, and cashier all in the same week with random times of day every day. You may not accept tips. Most of the staff are ages 14 to 20. It's like working at a high school. You may be scheduled 6 days a week and not quite ever reach 40 hours a week. This is the reality of working for Safeway."
bad,Safeway’s front end staffs commaradery was like no other job I have worked at. Whether it was in the work place or off time we collaborated so much better than even some actual families did. We worked fast and hard but we also On our down time to be there for one another running the store better than well oiled machine
bad,It was a good job to have as a student. They worked with my school schedule and they had flexible hours in the position I had. I don't recommend this job to any who doesn't like meeting new people or have to stand on your feet for long period of times.
bad,"come in and work somewhere people when they shop there rude and disrespectful  and most of the time they take there anger out on the workers at safeway that are judt trying to do theyre jobs. "
bad,Management doesn't have a clear direction on what they want. Sets unrealistic expectations on employees. No sense of loyalty to their employees. Very week union that does not show up unless they want union fees.
bad,"minimum wage, the management was bad and the employees were never working. Manager would not change my hours, would get mad when someone calls in sick and tells them they might get fired"
bad,There was always to much work and not enough help. They always had sales goals that were set so high you could never reach them. Advancement was based on popularity and if you worked your butt offf it never paid out.
bad,"Served as a help-desk for store managers with product errors and inquiries about clubcard promotions. Performed data entry services for club card promotions."
bad,"typical day you are filling meds, running the register helping customers. It can be overwhelming I dont know what else to say the job didnt work out because of the location"
bad,For my first job this was a horrible introduction to the working world. It was a tough work atomosphere and the only friends I made at work were ones I had already known prior to working there. Not worth the hassle
bad,"they overwork you and big on seniority. also underpaid, the management was bad, the worker there seem to take side as ethnicity, when asking for day off they wasn't too happy."
bad,I think the only reason I enjoyed going to work at Safeway was because of the people that I worked with. The customers were nice too but I felt like I was basically a dog playing fetch for people's groceries.
bad,"I am a baker at Safeway and really enjoy the fast-paced, multi-tasking requirements of the work so I feel conflicted about offering a poor review. Safeway doesn't value their baker's and continues to cut hours at a pitiful pay rate."
bad,place and work was great great co workers and customers were great the only downfall would have to be whne managment changed everything after that was not the same
bad,As a service clerk my duties were to pick up the baskets and returning good back to the departments.  Nice friendly customers.  Good benefits when working at safeway after 1 year
bad,Where can I safely it was a new experience. I got to get a handle of cash handling and as well as getting along better with the customers. I think it would be a better environment if the managers were very nice.
bad,Managers were below par and there was always drama in the work place. I was wish it was better and i somewhat enjoyed the coworkers. Best part was getting paid every week.
bad,"I worked at the front end as a cashieir, customer service and register,checking out the customers, handled large amounts of cash, clean work area, helped customers when they needed."
bad,"I've been with Safeway for 7+ months. It was a huge change from my previous job (Lowe's) since there were new things to learn, like weighing produce, looking up produce, etc. I also learned how to process eWIC, SNAP, EBT Cash, etc. The hardest part of the job would have to be customers getting angry that we only had a couple cashiers available, and the store was packed. Theft was also a huge problem because of the neighborhood I was in had a homeless shelter right across the street."
bad,"I never worked at a place where I felt so disposable. Management was often very condescending towards their employees, and coworkers were often very rude."
bad,the management at Safeway is just horrible. they lack professionalism and morals. they absolutely do not care about their employees and work them for their own personal gain.
bad,"Working at Safeway I was required to join the Union which had several fees I was unaware of, including fees that were taken out from each paycheck.  I also did not receive enough hours."
bad,"Safeway is an okay place to work, they are not competitive with other companies when it comes to salary and benefits but working with my team members and customers was the best part."
bad,"Just don't work for them. Also, you have to pay the union $50 per month. You only get 10 cents more than minimum wage for being part of the union. They expect too much and care too little about your needs."
bad,"Safeway had a vision, and then lost it. It became more concerned with health care, then with the business of selling groceries. Thereafter, it got itself ready for sale, and was sold."
bad,A lot is expected of workers while hard work is not rewarded. Even managers are paid very little and are expected to work 50+ hours a week while on salary.
bad,this was a decent job but the manager expected the world out of his employees but we were not fairly compensated and were even told to go on strike. just crazy
bad,its a very stressful enviroment and very poor management. well the one i worked at anyway. The people that do work there just make it hard to even work or want to go to work.
bad,"To be fair I can only speak about the Deli because that's the department I worked in, but this wasn't a great first job. My co-workers were crabby and the training for the job was very poor."
bad,"The unionized culture of Safeway lead to solid job security, in some cases too solid as employees consistently acted unprofessional on daily basis. It is a college town so I believe a better system of training and development needs to be in place in order to create a more professional and supportive culture helping instill work ethic, pride, and professional mobility. Rather than a very low-level of computer training and unsupportive management that allows an environment of failure to be existent, and is curious as to why young student labor and elderly minimum wage workers do not put effort into showing up on top, establishing clear uniform code, and putting  passion into the product."
bad,Safeway denied me my pay from paid vacation time I had accrued from working there over a year. Causing me to leave the job due to lost wages. Managers frequently caused hostile environments.
bad,I loved the job it was simple and fun to do. I would of loved to have stayed if management was more understanding to my schedule. Co workers were great though always understanding.
bad,"Grocery stores are great for starter jobs. But I took on more responsibility without ever seeing the pay. 3 job titles i held, at one point. Even worked the deli with promise to get payed a dollar more an hour...the new guy got what I was told I was going to make."
bad,I had some fun and nice co-workers. You had to balance out working in the back and prepare product with going on the to make sure every thing stocked. At the same time you have to work the counter when a customer come up.
bad,The fellow employees are very kind and they are willingly to help others. The manager is flexible for your schedule and but some times there are problems with your schedule.
bad,Working here was the poorest I've ever been. I worked minimum wage and only part time. On top of that I had to pay into a union from which I was not eligible for any of it's benefits. Technically making less than minimum wage. This was a very unpleasant experience for me and something I don't look upon fawnly.
bad,"I've met some awesome co workers and we all have such a great time. Albertsons took over Safeway and is running their stores to the ground. Corporate expects too much done with so little help. None of the management is happy and all run around like wild, angry chickens with their heads cut off. Its ashamed."
bad,"The place is very dirty. And the pay is so low that you'd have to work 100 hours a week to be able to afford anything at all. All you do is stand there for hours and don't get adequate breaks. No one cares about anyone there, and all the people are snobby."
bad,"Management was poor when I worked there. All low-level employees are in the union, so working your tail off is somewhat pointless. Not that I thrive off of recognition, but positive reinforcement after quality work is nice once in a while."
bad,"Good work place...besides the supervisor and manger being best friends. I was removed from this job because the supervisor was highly rude and i for one, don't accept disrespect."
bad,Avoid this company - heavy workload due to major layoffs.  Technology is out of date and will leave you without skills to take to future employers.  It used to be a great company.
bad,Safeway Night stocking was a very good learning experience what it was like working through the night. The job was pulling pallets from a semi trailer and bringing them out into the store to unpack and put the food and goods nearest their shelving location.
bad,I was taking orders for birthdays and going to get orders for customers close down bakery when it closes clean and make sure everything is sanitize help assist the cutting machine
bad,When I was there we were in the rice business. It is a old mill in the middle of no where. Expect to work in all weather. Not a climate controlled building.
bad,"Management was terrible, and the hours were bad too. Unprofessional and lewd, the worst job I ever had!! I would never go back even if it was the last job on earth."
bad,"There was no team there, the employees didn't really help each other. There was no lunch, only a break of 20 minutes in an 8 hour shift, no more. Managers don't really care much about their employees."
bad,I was expected to do the work of 2 departments and I was very unhappy there. Management in my department was great but over seeing management was rude and insensitive.
bad,The store I was with had very few hours to give so the hours were limited . The employees were very nice however serveral of the managers weren't very nice to it's employees .
bad,There was many things to do lots of customers to help an assistance hour where okay the only thing was they never had a set schedule so we would work weird an odd days an always work on weekends
bad,"I also learned a lot about hard work, working at Safeway. Unfortunately most of my co workers weren't very productive so I had to pick up slack for them, but it all paid off!"
bad,If you are looking for a friendly environment with concerned coworkers safeway is a great place to work.  They make walking in as a new worker not so nerve racking.
bad,"The work days are straight forward. Once you learn how the job works you can make a mental schedule for yourself on when certain tasks must be done. However these tasks can be affected on how your co-workers and bosses balance their job as well. Some days can be great but some can be stressful is management or other co-workers can do their portion of work. "
bad,I loved working there got along with all employee's and made friends. But I didn't like safeway at the same time because everything they did was completely unorganized none of the head managers knew what was going on. Also in training we were told that safeway weren't aloud to have empty soap machines in any food department and first day on a job I went to go wash my hands and the soap dispenser was completely empty. Employees would argue and fight and get away with it. So it's a bad place to be around.
bad,"I wasn't to big on the work place environment, working at the mall was not my thing although everyone was friendly and if you like folding clothes and greeting people all day this is the place for you."
bad,Management is not very great. They can work on that more. Some of the required tasks are easy to accomplish but the lack of enough employees makes it difficult to accomplish any of the given tasks in a busy day.
bad,"I worked at Safeway because I had just moved to a new town and they were the first company to say, ""Yes."" I stayed longer than two months because I liked working with those in my department. The only reason I worked there as long as I did is beyond me."
bad,The pay rate is good but the way the system is ran by management needs a major overhaul . overall I would give a 2 star mainly because of the management
bad,"At the beginning, this was one of the coolest jobs. Staff was great, management was wonderful. Within 3 years the job started going downhill. Corporate started getting stupid ideas on how to make the company better, it didn't work. Added more strain to the employees and always finding ways to cut hours. Even though their guide sheets would say to have a certain amount of hours for a duty, they would cut it by at least 25 percent. Ever since the merger, we only gained more managers and less hours."
bad,I got one 15 minute break on an 8 hour shift and I had to fight for a lunch. I called the union many times and even then the managers were rude about giving me breaks.
bad,working with people is a good way to interact and develop social skills. Managers weren't as helpful to new employees as they should have been. Memorizing codes was really difficult
bad,My day I would help costumers when needed and ring up groceries. I learned how to manage money but work with all types of people. Management was not very good to work for. Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult costumers.
bad,"It has good people there who can make working there enjoyable but the area I was in also had people in positions of authority that weren't very well behaved under pressure and that made for a very stress filled situation multiple times, and that to me isn't something I need or want in the workplace."
bad,I liked working for Safeway because of my coworkers and my regular customers. Didn't really care for the management because there was no communication between management. Managers will show favoritism and will let you know that they do not like you by just their body language. What I learned is that a worker must have tough skin and not to take things seriously.
bad,i worked really hard for this company for two years and my hard work went un noticed new employees after me were pramoted within a few short months of being hired when i would try to go above and beyond to prove myself worthy of pramotion
bad,"I did not enjoy working for Safeway. Every day I went there wondering what my manager would scold me for, which created a lot of anxiety for me. My manager treated me differently than the other technicians, she would embarrass me in front of my co-workers and the customers, and made me feel stupid for asking questions. I am a really hard worker but I was always being accused of not doing anything. Worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,They are very focused on the speed of your packaging so it you are slow this is not the job for you. A very high turnover rate so do not be surprised if you get hired and you do not see certain people anymore.
bad,I hated it there. They lied to me about how much they would start me at. Then they told me that they where going to start training me to be a head clerk. I never got any training and I was there for moths and watched other people get trained. They bagged me to work for them on Christmas day and they said if I worked for them on Christmas day that my pay will be dubbed. I got my paycheck from them after working on Christmas and my pay check was only .36 cents more than normal for working holiday pay.
bad,"Enjoyed working with the customers each day."
bad,"not very good pay, poor benefits, and the management wasn't very concerned for employees. I did, however, learn a lot about handling food, and customer service."
bad,"I started as courtesy clerk in a few months I was working full time night crew. A two dollar raise, which I never got. Manager at the time almost got the whole store shut down."
bad,The employees were the best part of the job and the only reason I stayed as long as I did. The work was kind of bad because they always had everyone understaffed or were cutting hours so the higher ups could get their bonuses.
bad,Durring my time at Safeway I learnt how to operate an electric pallet jack as well as I learnt team leadership skills. I also enjoyed my management team they were very helpful.
bad,"You stand all day long, but you do get set breaks and lunches. The hours varied every week. My hours got cut, forcing me to find another job. I was getting paid only 10 cents above minimum wage, but had to pay union dues and medical insurance fees."
bad,"It is an alright place to work. Customers and coworkers were really nice, however the management was unprofessional and disorganized."
bad,"Took out peoples groceries, swept floor, bagged customers groceries   and made sure the carts where in the store and cleaned bathrooms."
bad,I guess its a good first job. One of the things i dont like is the rude people who go in there and try to tell you how to do your job or just talk bad about your job. Sometimes i feel like we do more than we should. I dont get paid enough for everything i do.
bad,Corporation does not appear to be truly concerned about all health aspects of their employees.  Employees are given time constraints than are sometimes not humanly possible. Co-workers were allowed to belittle other co-workers without appropriate reprimand.
bad,i didn't really like my experience here and would rather not review it due to my experience being negative.
bad,"Arrived at worked, performed the tasks asked of me, went home. I learned to be quick on me feet, and met some interesting people."
bad,"A typical day at work I have to take care of several different customers, I have learned to multi-task many different things at once fast and efficient, I get along with all my co-workers and work well with them that's because I am a team player and enjoying helping others, the hardest part of my job is dealing with so many different personalities, The most enjoyable part of my work day is knowing that I helped some one."
bad,"Like I said in the other review, boycott Safeway, Nothing but judgmental sexist hatred in that company, at least the on in Ellensburg WA."
bad,It is a good place to work because the people I worked with were great.   The customer were super good  no great people to see all the time.
bad,Worked as barista for Starbucks but was employed by Safeway so my pay was less than if I had worked at a single owned Starbucks.
bad,This job wasn't for me.  I felt like I was doing a lot for the small amount I was getting paid.  Customers were often cranky but others enjoy working there.
bad,It is a great place to work for some people. It's an interesting learning experience.
bad,"It was very good review and very outsanding company to work.And"
bad,Did everything that could be done in the store for the most part
bad,All about the bottom line. managing Department and ensuring that the company makes sales quotas
bad,"Schedule would change constantly, with no notice from management."
bad,"Upon starting my day I usually opened the department. I would write the supply orders daily, prepare hot and cold foods, attend daily manager meetings, greet customers, keep up with temperature logs, keep shelves stocked, etc. My department and store managers were very understanding and easy to work with. My co-workers were easy to get along with, but lacked motivation and speed. The hardest part of my job was being able to get all of my duties done because we were understaffed. I was usually there alone for about half of my shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was stocking shelves and supplies in our supply room."
bad,started there because I was young and didnt know any better.
bad,"Except for the fact that instead of giving you more hours so you could afford to live they would just hire more people  an keep you at 24 hours, just enough for the union guarantee."
bad,"It was nice opportunity working  there .The store opens 24 hours "
bad,A typical day at work was helping customers. I learned how to work a cash register. Management was okay and so was the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was learning all the different codes for produce. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
bad,"i work for 3 safe ways, oak harbor safe way was the worst ever. "
bad,I wasn't told some things that needed to be done.  Lots of paperwork to be done and it is sometimes hard to help customers because things aren't available.
bad,"Safeway as a whole is a great company. Employees are great, they all work very hard. The problem with the Hawaii region is Hawaii does not require a Pharmacy Tech License so pay is very low, so the compensation for this specialized field would not be able to support the cost of living."
bad,I work the font line to make sure the customer has the best shopping experience.
bad,It was interesting to learn about the company and industry. It is a fast paced company due to daily/weekly deadlines to be met. There are A LOT of terms you have to digest within a short amount of time before bosses/managers start to scold you for being a deer in headlights.
bad,I guess it depends on which store you work at. The one i worked at was horrible. A lot of the other courtesy clerks were lazy and i had to do a major part of the work. Stay away if you are applying for a courtesy clerk position.
bad,Safeway used to be one of the best grocery stores to work for. Now a days they over work you and offer you less and less as far as incentives. If you hurt yourself on the job they try not to pay you and or will release you back to work even though your still injured. They have poor District managers that expect stores to operate with very little man power and stores are penalized and repromanded for poor performance when the reasons are lack of man hours.
bad,Store management was horrible. My kiosk did not have a manager or supervisor after the termination of one. Third shift barista was not certified after hire. The experience with the store was traumatic but my customers were A1 LOVED them especially my regulars.
bad,Negotiate high for your salary before you accept the job. Its almost impossible to get any raises once you are in.
bad,"Wasn't challenging at all. Had a lot of downtime at work, eventually became extremely boring."
bad,The company is a good upstart company. The production will be a hugh sucess.
bad,Hard work and under-appreciated. Lack of a good training program. High expectations with little support. Grateful for the competitive wage and good benefits. Also thankful for my pension.
bad,"I managed to work with alot of different types of people at this job, and it has taught me a great deal about how to handle high work loads with minimal hours. That being said, they do not treat there employees like people."
bad,I was with this company 10 yrs before getting layed off just cause the mangsr of the store didnt like me i did my job infact i did three peoples job every day witxh isnt fair
bad,"The typical nickname that I began to hear about Safeway about 4 months into my job was ""Slaveway"", and I finally understand it. The employees are stressed to do so many jobs and there is very little help available. When I mentioned this to the management, there was very little that anyone did and it seemed as though nobody cared. While I know that the management in my store could be better, I know it is mainly corporate that is forcing all of these budget and hour cuts while demanding more be done. Overall, I think working at Safeway (despite the benefits and all that) is a bad idea. It was a great job while it lasted, but the company is NOT as good as it used to be."
bad,I started as a cashier and then progressed to the cash office and was responsible for completing the banking on a daily basis and was involved newspapers and magazine
bad,"I liked working at Safeway because the people I worked with.  The company kept asking you to learn different positions but then after doing the work to advance, advancement did not happen"
bad,"Fast paced/ very demanding work environment, great pay benefits with poor management, a huge lack of teamwork. The hardest part of the job was communication with management, lack of communication/cooperation within other departments."
bad,this job is kinda alright i mean if you like picking up garbage cleaning up dropped food or juice or eggs but again its alright to work here just wish breaks where longer
bad,Safeway will teach you how to deal with the general public  it’s a good job if your fresh out of  or still in high school  but it now takes a long time to top out  so you will be making pretty much nothing for a long time but I hated the fact that every week was a different schedule and never had two days off in a row it’s like they are against people actually having two days off in a row  and if you want a weekend off good luck
bad,Safeway has undergone many changes since it's take over. Sobeys treats Safeway staff as expendable. It is next to impossible to get a full time position.  Part time employees get a cap on hours they are allowed to work. It's a company that is in trouble.
bad,"I absolutely loved the staff that I worked with. However we were all overworked, underpaid, and not appreciated by management. The hours would change constantly. One day you may work 4am to 1230 (a four hour shift) and the next would be 5am until 9. They would give the bare minimum of hours."
bad,The work in this company is wonderful but there is no physical stimulation and there are no functional names and promotion for everyone. For me it became boring because it did not support me physically and I look for any other job opportunity and better to be outside my country
bad,management only takes care of management.. if an employee comes with something serious they need to address they brush it off especially if its about there manager. they refuse to see bad in people management staff..
bad,"A typical day for me at work would watering plants , putting helium in balloons and making shore my work place was clean. I learned a lot about plants and flowers how to care of them and etc. My manger was very nice and always wanted to make shore I understood everything and always show me new things. Working on the floral department was just me alone most nut throughout the whole Safeway all the co workers were very nice .The hardest part of the job was making shore all 300 planets and flowers were watered. The enjoyable part was meeting new people and making the prom flower bouquets."
bad,"They don't provide any one-on-one training for cashier. you're trained on a computer using a keyboard and mouse, once you finish with that training which is a week they throw you up by yourself at a register. I wasn't expecting to be on my own right away and I did terrible, long lines, management took a long time to come correct something that prevented me from completing the customers transaction and I had MANY customers leave all of their stuff because it took so long and they got upset and left, leaving the rest of the customers behind impatient and me embarrassed and in tears and management still took long to come cancel out the order. It wouldn't of been a bad job if they would've provided one-on-one training on the cash register with an employee who has been there a while. Only received 8 hours a week, Saturday and Sunday from 7-11 pm which was ridiculous so I quit. Some of the workers were nice, one guy was very rude to me because I was new. I enjoyed nothing about this job."
bad,A company that has been in existence for many years should treat their support staff with the same respect and honesty as they expected from them. Good pricing for the consumer and additional small discount for workers. Employees were a great team that helped each other through the transition to Haggens.
bad,Management doesn't seem to care about you. You are just a number. They cut hours to all employees to bring in lesser paid people. after 11 years I am still part time and only receiving 24 hours a week. They don't care. Its impossible to get a set schedule.
bad,"The job was okay and gave me hours for the weekend during my highschool years. It taught me how bag groceries, bring in carts, and some minor janitorial duties. Management was nice and would work with you if you had anything come up. Coworkers were nice and enjoyable to work with. Hardest part was the long hours with boring work done, and not much customer interaction. Most enjoyable was the carts cause you can just do the work fast keep moving, was less boring than bagging food."
bad,"A typical day as a store manager involves 12 hour work days, dealing with rapid and often conflicting changes in merchandizing."
bad,stock shelves. order product. build displays. coach employees. customer service. cashier. management responsibilities
bad,The store when I worked there was going through a rough spot. The management had just changed and the bakery department was a mess. I was going to school and working 8 hour shifts and for the work I did the pay was lousy.
bad,"The Good:  If you had no education and you wanted to make a career of working at a grocery store you could do that even if you were not the slightest bit intelligent.  You had maximum benefits and the ability to work hard and work your way up the pay scale and job title.  and paid vacation if you work there long enough.  The jobs you performed were easy.  "
bad,"They need better pay and fare pay, better work environment , and drug test for hard drugs like meth , better security to much riff Raff in the store always someone in there on drugs or doing drugs in the bathrooms and employee bathrooms the bathroom their is really gross."
bad,Worked at Safeway for three months a few years ago. We always had horrendous rushes from very large groups coming in from a neighboring safeway. Was a very stressful environment when I was there. Good coworkers though.
bad,I really enjoyed working with my manager and his team he was great they just don't offer any benefits or medical coverage and I have a family so I needed those thing.
bad,"My career with Safeway was a waste of time, they lack training for employees, and never have enough hours to be staffed comfortably. Safeway is part of the Union good thing. They like to fire long time, loyal employees so they can hire for a less wage."
bad,"Once you get past the Management of the store, the job is amazing and the regular customers are amazing to be around! I really enjoyed gaining the relationships that I did with my regulars."
bad,it was very hard and frustrated because if your coworker didn't do what he or she was told you would have to pick up on everything he or she didn't do right and the management was very rude
bad,"My work experience at Safeway was a pleasant one, everyone in the workplace were friendly and polite! A overall good work experience! I would recommend."
bad,"you learn how to communicate with customers, co-workers and management. Gain knowledge about groceries, product, and merchandise. hardest part- scheduling- its retail- they rather you have open availability. Enjoyable part is creating bonds with the neighborhood families that come often."
bad,"Great place when you are in school..."
bad,"I was a head clerk, its not a good work enveriorment they exspect you to jobs that were put of your job"
bad,Department was horribly understaffed so it turned an enjoyable job into a stress filled nightmare. On the other hand though the employess I worked with were the best of people and they are what made quitting the job so hard.
bad,"Safeway is a great place to work if you are just searching for an easy job and do it for life. As described in the title, Safeway UFCW provides great union protection on its employees, like heath care, dental care, etc. However, the job nature of Safeway is extremely boring as stocking products to shelves, receiving inventory, etc. It might be fun to begin with, but eventually, you might find the job is really boring, and lack of motivation."
bad,"I did lot of cleaning ,organizing ,dealing with customers questions and letting them know where things were located.I learned that I could accomplish a way better job title that was more focused on what i want to do."
bad,"Was hired in the personal shopping dept. Hired with competitive wages and benefits. Co-workers always leaving and going, (hired and fired) The perks were having a Starbucks in the front of the store. Hardest part of job was keeping up with the early hours."
bad,"Safeway is a very high and fast paced job.We bring in varieties of culture,personality, and happy customers.We enjoy giving back and doing whatever is needed to bring nothing but satisfaction.I learned very good management skills and how to make good judgments and the right judgments based on quality service and the right services just for our customers.Having to help run the front end and making sure the financial part of my job was all the good challenges i enjoyed about this position.As well as bringing great satisfaction daily to our cherished customers.The management was always aiming to please the customers as well and was greatly done.The hardest part of the job was working under pressure and high volume of customers all at once.But it was the best part of the job i liked,bringing me so many challenges.I love challenges."
bad,I loved this job at first before the manager took over. That's where things got stressful. I was a delivery driver for Safeway. I wouldn't recommend this to no one because unless you desperately need a job
bad,I really enjoyed working in the deli as a cashier and the employees were very friendly and helpful and the work atmosphere was great and friendly and management was very polite and great
bad,Working for Safeway was amazing. After the Albertsons buy out it took a turn for the worse. The way Albertsons runs their company is no good in my opinion.
bad,"Good place to work for college student. The pay is ok, but the advancement is minimal. It takes at least 6mths to be full-time, but you have to get excepted as a full-time employee, so its not guaranteed. It takes a while before you can reach a $20 pay."
bad,"The people working there are amazing, not only because of their job but they are genuinely fun and cooperative. Besides that its a regular stressful retail work with lots of surprises and often not enough help available."
bad,"Mostly employees working alone no manager working along side."
bad,I was my own boss. I learned how to look ahead to see what needed to be done next. My manager was very approachable. The hardest thing about my job was depending on others in the workplace. The most enjoyable part of job was independence.
bad,Corporate doesn't have a clue. The employees are lazy and do whatever they want but they're nice people. The theft is ridiculous so corporate tries to save money at the employees and paying customers cost.
bad,When I first started it was a great place to work . Then politics took over and made for a poor work place. The pay was great and the hours were good.
bad,Busy day with a lot of paperwork busy line phone I have learned patience is the virtue of everything managing is getting the Job done by all necessary the part hardest of the job is the late night calls the most enjoyable is the challenging part of the job period.
bad,"I enjoyed working for Safeway, but after my ten years (2003) company became cut-throat and unappreciative. I loved the fast pace type of work and the great customers."
bad,honesty is not their policy the make false accusations towards the employees
bad,"Stressful,  lots of favoritism among managers and supervisors.  The schedule changes were every 6 months.  Over all the Director of the call center was amazing.   It was a very fun place when I first stated in 2003."
good,"The job was stressful but the pay and the overtime that I was giving was great. I loved working overnight there. The new store manager and I just never really got along so she fired me, it’s a long story."
good,bad place to work but I met a lot of great people. only worked four hours a  shift and got no off days but did get pay deferential. bad experience over all
good,No one should be so stressed at a job. Long hours and a short amount of time to get certain tasks done.  Just can't handle all of the stress all the time.
good,Ever since Albertsons took over the Safeway name it has been a circus show. I am constantly taking complaints about us being under staffed. Poor scheduling.
good,"could not count on anything, union dues were high with no benefits. This job was extremely stressful, someone always trying to blame you for something,"
good,"At first all was well and the job was amazing. Unfortunately they tend to keep employees who are rude and disrespectful to customers as well as management not wanting to reprimand for fear of ""rocking the boat."" I was put on medical leave after the abuse from coworkers became so bad I was becoming physically ill. I broke my foot and was told to suck it up and get to work... Couldn't go back so resigned. If I wanted to deal with that kind of abuse, I would still be in my first marriage...."
good,the staff was nice. just wished that the store was better staffed and allowed staff to take the proper breaks and lunches that they are allowed.
good,ringing out clients same while trying to make them give donations. not a bad place to work in.
good,I was mostly standing there waiting for people to be done shopping. managment was very uptight.The hardest part was just standing there and not keeping busy. The enjoyment of the day was all the people.
good,"A typical day at work was busy and customer service was a must. There was rarely any down time. When i worked there, the store was one of the busiest in town. The work was physically taxing but rewarding. Even being busy and tough work, it was a laid back environment to work with, usually not requiring supervision."
good,So far I enjoy cashiering. Very little hours but high turn over rate so I'm sure I'll collect more hours as I go. Most employees are easy going and easy to talk to.
good,Working at Foster city Safeway was not on the list of my favorite jobs. Management didnt communicate with each other well and if you were fake enough you could make friends.
good,"Wouldn't recommend working here. More work, more stress, less pay. It's not worth the time nor money to even consider working here. Management tries to help as much as they can with problems but the whole operations is generally messed up."
good,I worked in starbucks and you don't get any of the benefits you would actually working at a strabuxks because its through safeway. So I think that is a little unfair.
good,Union place. No chances for promotion unless you plan on spending 25 years doing night shift. promotions are based on seniority and not ability. good if you want to put in time and stay there. you will struggle for the first 10+ years. once you  move up on the seniority list you will be ok. Management will say one thing and do another. always get everything in writing and be clear and concise on everything you do because you will be called out on it.
good,The manager I had for the deli department was never there when we needed him and he tried to make us save on food by going against food regulations I tried to make complaints and lost my job
good,"This was a good place to work for though the salary was basic, I enjoyed the experience of working on different departments and different responsibilities"
good,"I would not refer a friend or family to work at Safeway, unless it is absolutely necessary. poor management and highly stressful, doesn't work well with requested time off"
good,Working there was fine at first until different managers began to pick with certain employees. they cut hours to only 1 -2 days per week. I wouold recieve a $50 pay check at the end of every week.
good,Worked here in college and it was a good job for the time. Paid decently but definitely not a career type job. Never enough employees working at the same time and employees are overworked.
good,"Safeway was a complete waste of time. They make you work with unions, so you pay a good portion of your paycheck to them for little to no help. My managers were complete jerks to me and made me work on Thanksgiving and Christmas eve. Constantly made me work the doughnut shift (2am-10am) with no differential in pay."
good,"At Safeway Starbucks, you are often expected to do the job of three baristas, due to a lack of staffing. You may end up running the entire kiosk by your self for hours at a time. Emotional break downs are something to look forward to."
good,I have worked for Safeway for almost 3 months and they give you more work to do for two or three people but still expected to get all the work done before you close. You work most holidays and weekends and you close at night.  They give you part time hours and then a union dues are expensive. And when you want to make a payment plan to pay that they make sure you pay one third down first and pay the rest off ..
good,"The experience gained by working in a retail bakery was irreplaceable, unfortunately there is little to no advancement opprotunites because it is a big cooperate business, but to gain experience and be trained by a large business."
good,"enjoyed working with others "
good,"Coming into the workforce from a college bakery program was an easy transition, but the balance was not something that Safeway ever considered. I was not an on call worker but my job was threatened if I refused to cover a shift with LESS than 10 hours notice. Granted, there was always the union to turn to, I did not enjoy the feeling of putting my job on the line saying no."
good,"i was not given any opportunity for advancement any time a manager would relay something of importance a higher up would counteract it making me the scapegoat, i have no loyalty or enjoyment with my previous jobs but i will in future ones if i am given the respect i deserve"
good,To political and management needs to be re-evaluated and retrained. They can't even get schedules correct as well as lead the employees. The turn around rate is bad because management does not treat the cashiers or clerks with respect. Management yells at employees in front of customers and have no sense of how to be a manager.
good,"not an ideal job for a long term job "
good,"this was my first paying job. I have learned a few things such as cleaning the entire store, assisting customers and being able to comply with the store policy"
good,"I have fun working with interesting people, having laughs an meeting interesting an funny customers"
good,Working with my employees and some of my managers were great. We had good times.
good,Because when I got hurt at work know one supported me. They treated me like a stranger like if I was a no body sad to say but true. And if you see someone who gets to put there all into there job they should be nice
good,"I can speak for management at other stores, but the store I am assigned to, the management is horrible. To give you an idea, customers complain often about the managers and the operations the managers are responsible for."
good,The best part was interacting with the customers and most of the employees with whom I worked with. Management was good for a while and then the store manager and assistant manager left and management went downhill from there.
good,Overall once albertson took over everything went down hill.new management and merging co workers the worst idea ever. I suggest go to work for ralphs.
good,"They changed my schedule without telling me."
good,"Not a place to build a career but if you have the right boss, things can be good. Hours aren’t the best in winter. You can’t survive off of what you make there."
good,"I learned that this is a company that could never meet my value as an employee, they underpay their staff, overwork the members that have higher positions, and among other scenarios, are ridiculously cut throat about their methods and procedures."
good,"management was very poor and unfair treatment  as well putting employee out of their work scope. leaned how to work hard and keep busy, find things to do in down time."
good,"I was the youngest one working, yet was the most likely to be called in. People often skipped work days, and were rarely reprehended. Managers would often disagree, and would try to scheduled me during high school hours. They did not fallow age restricted laws, and have the employees were high on the job. If one was a responsible worker they would get more work piled on with no benefits."
good,"Poor management, takes advantage of employees. Union sucks honestly, pay sucks for the amount of work and flow of customers, plus high prices . Wouldn’t work here again ."
good,"It was ok to work there temporarily, it was not a job I wanted to make a career out of. The hours were ok.  Most of the coworkers complained about the others."
good,"Not enough hours , handling money, computer, cash register,money grams,western union. Management always changed. Work place culture ok. the hardest part of the job management not consistent the most enjoyable part of the job I like working with people."
good,Pay starts at $7.50. Hired part time with no benefits except 401k and employee discount. No paid vacation time unless you've worked a specified number of hours. Impossible to get when hours are cut back.
good,"when i worked at safeway  it was all just drama"
good,"A typical day at work was very hectic. There was always so much work to do, even with the amount of customers that came every day. It was very difficult to tend to them when there wasn't enough people working. It was also difficult because customers get impatient very quickly. There wasn't any pro of the job."
good,"Not enough hours, confusing scheduling. I have been here almost a year now and still only ever get closing shifts. Management doesn't listen to employee concerns. Sick days are a joke."
good,Safeway was a good experience for me when I was in high school. I enjoyed earning money but I didn't feel motivated at all. My motivation was to work harder than anyone else so I could get 40 hours a week.
good,"I could not get promoted above Person in Charge because the store manager was intimidated by someone with a masters degree. And, I wouldn't sleep with him. Big surprise, the union didn't do anything to help"
good,"It's an okay position but after a year of having good attendance, performance and reliability, I've only received one raise and no encouragement of ever being able to move up as they told me while I interviewed. Looking to be with a company I can grow with in my future as well."
good,"My experience at Safeway was very interesting, I loved every coworker I met. But by the time I had to move (and told my boss I was putting my 2 weeks in) he terminated me. So still haven't received my last paycheck."
good,"a typical day in my store specially in my Department (Deli) is that you clock in and start to walk around the area see the item that is out of stock,to be distress,to be donate,and to order and everything I learned everything in just 2 weeks because after that training your own your own so I have to .my co-worker are the hard-workers,loving and sense of humor that makes the Job a lot easier thanks to them i manage to stay in the company for 3yrs."
good,"I enjoyed working here, I enjoyed working with my workmates, not much room for advancement but it was laid back and worth the time I took out of my life to  go to work here"
good,"You would clock in and the first thing you would do is go bring in carts, start bagging, or tend to the bottle room. I learned that you have to move fast in that work environment. I learned who I could work with and who I couldn't. The hardest part was getting targeted by my assistant manager. The best part was the Customers."
good,"no matter how good you are, or how much you accomplish, others that do less are held less accountable and have better benefits(pay retirement health)"
good,"Employees cared more about the customers than management, no room for advancement, scheduling all over the place unable to have a so called normal life. Pay was low to the worked invloved"
good,"Work place experience personal. Work day began at 3 pm to 11pm, pulled orders from produce section. Worked with co-workers as a team."
good,"I worked here for nine years, it is an ok job. It's a very physical job and it puts wear and tear your body. Management is not very good in order to get your way you better be a pet to the store manager. Some co-workers are like family well others with stab you in the back in an instant. If you want a day off or vacation well just dream about it because the answer will be ""NO"". It takes a year to qualify for benefits but, if you are a courtesy clerk you will never get benefits. That job requires doing the nastiest jobs around the store. The only thing that is enjoyable about this job working nights you don’t ever have to see management or customers."
good,"a typical day at safeway was showing up, clocking in, and helping customers while cleaning at night. i learned how to properly clean dishes, ovens, etc. management wasn't so focused on the employees but more focused on what was profitable. co-workers were constantly talking behind other's backs and threw eachother under the bus persay. hardest part of the job was the constant changing in protocol that the department manager never explained to his/her employees. enjoyable part of the job was working with customers"
good,"Everything was based on seniority, so you go to work everyday hoping someone new is hired so you`re not the lowest on the food chain. "
good,I enjoyed learning how to work the cash register but the work atmosphere wasn't the gratest. Also the management was all the great either
good,"Worked as an Opener/Closer and Customer Service Representative. Customers were friendly and caring. The Co-Workers were hard to work with some days, everyone seems to serious and uptight. Management was strict and and favorable between employees they liked. My most enjoyable part of working for here was helping customers and having my paychecks on time. The hardest part of working here was the drama in the work place. I learned great work ethics here along with performing my tasks in a timely fashion, book keeping followed by superb attendance.   "
good,"I was really excited to get this job, it was close to my home and they seemed like they had flexible scheduling so I could still have a life outside of work. But they would have me come in and work til late at night, then I would have to get up bright and early the next day for an even longer shift. Which was stress on me. Management was poor there as well. They always criticized me for what I did wrong and never recognized me when I know I did a good job. Also they talked about me behind my back and I had no clue what was going on, and then they forced me to change to the courtesy clerk position when I thought I was improving out at the fuel station. Working at the fuel station was fun, but boring and when it was busy, it did get extremely stressful and chaotic. I always had to work with another person out in fuel, and when I did work by myself for 2 hours, it got extremely busy and chaotic and I felt like I was doing everything wrong. I got yelled at for a simple mistake. I got along with all my co-workers, and most of the customers. But when they changed me to the courtesy clerk position, it felt like a janitor's job. It got so busy that I didn't greet every single customer, and they let me go because of that. They criticized me for my poor customer service, even though I went out of my way to help people out. Also almost every hour they made me go out and get the carts, and I had to push up to 6 at a time sometimes. They wouldn't let us have drinks like water or Gatorade on the sales floor when it was really hot out. Because of this company, I never want to work for a grocery"
good,"the environment is toxic, management is inconsistant and triangulate staff"
good,disregard for employee rights and benefits
good,It's a great job for starting out only min wage and takes along time to get a raise. The cashier part is awesome the people you get to visit with as they come thru the till is cool. You learn how to use the till and the courtsey clerk is fun. You build a lot of muscles bringing in all the carts. You learn how to pack the grociers
good,Safeway can be a great place to work but management can cause lots of annoying problems as they don't really know what the employees actually do on the job.
good,The store manager can use organization with hours and flexibility.  I enjoy working here however the manager is not a team player and does not provide flexibility to employees.
good,I love of my experience was a very harsh when I was 8 months pregnant working there in which I did not get breaks on a regular schedule worked overtime with regular pay and constant mixups with pay. When I notified the boss there was no resolution and in the end  I had to end up quitting because there were too many stressful events at the store
good,"a very male centric upper management with some lack of initiative to provide good communication.  "
good,Lots of nepotism there. It's not fair the 3rd&4th key are mother and son and the deli manger is the 3rd key daughter and the deli asst manager is married to the 4th key. It's bad there
good,I have worked for Safeway for 10 years and for 10 years I have watched people pushed to be faster amd more acurate and yelled at if they can't do their job fast enough.
good,"I personally had a bad experience working at Safeway on the night crew, as a night stocker. The pay was terrible but I had just moved to the state and needed to have job history. the store manger was a jerk and wanted the worker to work off the clock to make him look better."
good,"I’ve always loved the team I’ve worked with and the job itself, but over the years the management has gone more and more down hill. I’m no longer able to effectively do my job at the level that is expected of me due to coverage yet get berated when I don’t accomplish something do to that lack. I’d like to be able to do my job well, and I no longer feel like I can give my full potential here."
good,"Poor management"
good,Other than the pay you are working whenever they need you. I only feel rested when I am on vacation. Just because there’s never any consistency in shifts.
good,Bad place to work. I got next to no hours but worked almost every day of the week. the management is horrible and treated me like I didn't matter to them.
good,everyday i come into work and 9 times out of 10 i will be short staffed or my staff will work very short shifts. The work expected to be done every night by each individual is very unreasonable. I feel like my management doesn't want to help me in any way or talk to me.
good,The bakery manager was very rude constantly writing me and only me notes on how I could improve wich were not fun. And whenever i wasdoing something she would tell me that its wrong and correct me rudely. I got no 15 minute break because i worked too slowly and manger got 10 15 minute breaks. Not to mention that the other bakery clerks would degrade me and if your not a smiker you dont get breaks
good,Very busy place to work Have worked here over a year and  have not gotten a raise I have asked for one and still no reply. Management is very bad there’s not talk to you the only time I talk to you it’s to tell you that you’re doing a bad job or that you need to work faster.
good,"Very open about not caring for their employees, unsanitary working conditions. store clutter and unorganized. unhappy co workers manager would play favorites with co workers"
good,Safeway is a struggling component of a large grocery conglomerate.  The individual stores are more concerned about daily profits than establishing long=term sustainable profits.  This makes for a stressful environment as the individual stores operate on the lowest amount of staff to complete the most amount of work.
good,"Everyday working there the managers just want stuff done and don't care about their employees as long s what they want done is done. personally as an employee id like to have a connection to my boss and would like to feel appreciated for my work once in a while. even a thanks here and there or a ""good job"" will do."
good,"The only thing that made this job so awful was the poor management, which seemed to be the same across the district. Many responsibilities outside of my job role fell on me to complete."
good,"Really fast paced then boring, customers enjoyable mostly, other employees rude to each other and when busy no where to be found for back up, manager not in to helping with life situations at all."
good,"I love what I did. I love working with customers, even the grumpy ones. I'd try my best to get the grumpy ones in a better mood by the time they left.  The pay was just NOT right. I managed fuel station and I'd get calls after hours about things that could've waited until the next day.  It was made perfectly clear to me that if I didn't like the way the director wanted things then she'd get someone to manage that would."
good,It is a stressful place to work at. Half the time no one knows what is going on not even the managers. Seniority plays a huge part in how things are done here.
good,"In four years I went from a checker to a merchandiser, (I was over qualified when I first started).  The work culture at Safeway was hard on my family - I was expected to answer my phone at all times."
good,"As a past employee with Safeway(Food and Drug), Inc., I found that Safeway may meet the needs of a person if they were seeking to "
good,"Very physical job always on your feet moving around and helping serve customers. Cooking food, making sandwiches. Lifting heavy boxes, stocking meats, cheeses, salads, sandwiches."
good,was a fun fast paced and productive place to work only sometimes the management wouldnt be on the same page. also working at a union job there was alot of differences that needed to be clear
good,"Nope nope nope nope "
good,"Just a bad time in general, no one was nice and the manager was never there the entire 3 months I worked. I never liked the work environment, no one was friendly and gave little respect to my position."
good,I learned a lot working for Safeway. I worked all over the store. My hours varied and there was a lot of drama. It lacked job advancement. I can't say I enjoyed a whole lot.
good,"A typical day would go by fast if you do what you need to do, I learned a lot but unfortunately the management was  unorganized and was not a place I wanted to grow in."
good,"No advancement in position. Don't expect help in a department if you're overwhelmed. Lower management is nice, higher management is awful. Pay rates are incredibly poor and inconsistent between departments and employees. Ridiculous turn-over rate."
good,"I enjoyed  working here only because of the money it offered. The management was absent most of the time and when you did have an issue they expected you to deal with it on your own and in the manner in which they wanted, but with them being absent most of the time that is difficult."
good,"This job is incredibly physically demanding. Not only do you have to be physically fit enough to handle the required weight limit for lifting, but extra training for safety measures, which are considerable, should be mandatory and revisited once per year."
good,"produtive, good pay, great benefits, commute, intertwined a little stressful, great first job great pay vacation pay sick pay personal days health care for the family"
good,"It's an ok job.  What makes the job worth going for are the people you get to work with.  They help when the job could be stressful or management gets overbearing, they help lift up the atmosphere. They job itself isn't hard, but having to deal with management that really don't have a nack for people, can be difficult."
good,"Safeway has been a great company to me in the past. I have been there for 12 years. I have received a number of promotions and I have been recognized for being a prime employee."
good,do not get the insurance you will never be able to get rid of it the company knows it and lies about it to get you to sign on. the management is completely corrupt and there is no job advancement what so ever. not even in your individual departments.
good,"Entire HR staff was given lay-off notice, but then asked to re-apply for our current positions. We were all replaced by people from the corporate office, but then I was offered the same position in a different state. Didn't make much sense."
good,"the typical work day is stressful, you dont learn much as a courtesy clerk and the management team is unprofessional . the work place culture is relaxed and friendly enough, but also unprofessional and do not take care of customers adequately. the hardest part of the  job is being micromanaged by some managers and not given enough help or time to finish long tasks they assigned. when brought to attention, it goes unaddressed, as well as you have no job security. they hire and fire many people within a small time frame, you only have security if you have seniority.  the most enjoyable part of the job is the friendships you make with your coworkers."
good,Every management personnel has a different expectation for you and what you need to get done first. Every day is stressful. You never know what to expect when you walk through the doors
good,The management is absolutely terrible ecept the second manager in produce! My coworkers were awesome. a typical day at work is absurdly horrible. The breaks arent long enough and they dont consider your disablillities
good,"I was not at all impressed with the Oliver square location. I was a part-time staff member and was only getting 30 hours, if that per week. I showed up every day and put everything I had into my work week, and was still made to feel as if I was just a  cog that was unimportant. before finding a second job to meet the needs of my small family I gave two weeks notice and moved between the two jobs , when I missed the very last shift dew to the other job that was providing more hours and the same money with out the union fees , I didn't make it in, so I was put on a do not hier list."
good,"my experience working for safeway.easy work if you know what your doing. there is no training at any position,managers are NOT there for employees. Remember Call your Union"
good,"I've worked at three different store locations. Two of them were union, and while it was stressful work as a checker, it was rather rewarding when people look forward to seeing you in your lane. At my current store however, a clusterfuck doesn't even begin to describe it. Management is everywhere doing nothing, I've been yelled at more times than I can count in an average day, and if I didn't need the money I'd be out of there faster than you could believe."
good,Work till the skin on your fingers wears thin with no real advancement until a senior coworker leaves. no real room to move up through the ranks unless you plan on being there multiple years.
good,I left Safeway to focus on my studies in Hospitality Management at SAIT Polytechnic. The hours avaliable did not work for my school schedule.
good,A typical day at work most of the time we are busy we may have a couple of slow days a week. working with thus company you learn to have an extreme amount of patients dealing with different types of customers daily.
good,"This company rarely recognizes hard work, employees are always treated as though they are replaceable. Hard work only makes you have more responsibilities no greater self gain."
good,"Safeway was my start up job. Deli work. It was a fun atmosphere, mostly young people. I worked there for a couple years but had to leave. Safeway is not a place that I would call my permanent job. As a start up job its amazing."
good,"I really enjoyed my job at Safeway until March of 2014.  Safeway has entered a merger with Cerberus, owner of Albertsons.  It has been very difficult not know what to expect for your future employment.  It is almost inhumane.  The rumors are frequent.  One thing that isn't a rumor and we continue to hear from upper management is that once the FTC rules on the merger that the 'new company' will be very lean...  We heard that word over 10 times in one presentation leading everyone to believe there will be mass layoffs.  If they would just let us know something about the fate of our jobs it would be a lot better."
good,The hardest part of the job is finding time to finish everything
good,It was my first experience in food service industry. They offer vacation and med insurance to all employees. A big plus. Very physically demanding work. No set schedule. Must be VERY flexible. Enjoyed working with all my co-workers. Company sets very high goals for its employees. I left in Jan 2014 due to health issues with my back which required 2 major surgeries in May 2014. Unable to return to Safeway due to 20 lb lifting restriction.
good,the only hard part for me was lifting hevy cases of beer and water being 5months prenant and they fired me cause im pregnant and im going to be a single parent and need a job
good,A typical day at work is not only bookkeeping but attending to the customer service department and dealing with complaints.
good,"management is never willing to help. it is constantly busy hardly get time to get your breaks, ive worked for three stores from where ive learned a lot managing inventory cash handling. co workers are fun to get along with. the most challenge for me is heavy duty other than that I do anything."
good,The job require flexible work hours. Learned how to use the cashier register. Management was unorganized would really show up to work and scheduled shifts were not available as needed. Enjoyable working with the interaction with customers and co-workers.
good,"A typical day would include greeting customers and asking if they needed help finding anything and bagging their groceries. I also helped with taking out trashes around the store, sweeping the entire sales floor, and cleaning the restrooms for a clean and healthy place to shop. I learned alot of great Customer Service skills like always smile, be patient, customers are always right, and always be professional. The management was not great at all. The Manager never interacted with the employees so he couldnt understand what any of us were having trouble doing. The assistant managers couldnt stay organized and always picked favorites between the office employees and the floor employees. Co- workers were always inconsiderate of others who had to finish others mess. The hardest part of the job was communicating with certain employees. Everyone chose favorites and let others get away with alot, there was more friendships then there were co workers. The most enjoyable part was when a customer would ask for you and only want you to help them and the relationship I had from meeting them their."
good,"at 2012 was working  at  this store in Seward AK, "
good,"Probably for the better, it was not a very good store. Customer complaints were regular. The complaints were always about the store's management, though."
good,"I enjoyed working there, The people are great, keep to yourself and work hard. You will benifit if the work is done."
good,"I learned many things about baking at Safeway that I can add to my skills, Management need some work its to many of them, co-worker's where great all of them, the hard part was being let go as a favor for a friend! I enjoyed helping the people the most important!"
good,"They teach you to do everything in the store. You will work floral, deli, cashier etc."
good,"Hostile, stress filled work place. Employees don't like working together and are all unhappy for the most part. All in all, not worth the time and energy spent there."
good,"Could be a good place to work for but management made it stressful for hard workers there.  In working there for 7 years, I never received a bonus or incentive to work there.  My manager would praise my work to other managers, but when talking to me, my manager did not tell me I was doing a good job.  I took the job at safeway because it was a job that paid the bills.  The particular store I worked at was not encouraging me in my job, nor were they positive."
good,"A typical day at work involves unloading grocery pallets that are brought in either before or after you clock in. On bad days these can range to several hours late, which usually means its impossible to complete your task. When breaking the load you spot, stock, and face the aisles with grocery product, which is the main part of the job. If you enjoy consistent tasks everyday, this aspect is true for Night Crew, however there are complications. "
good,This was unfortunately not the job for me. They were Disorganized and did not care much for their employees. I would not recommend this as a forever career.
good,"I left an okay situation at one safeway with an awful boss to another safeway with an even worse manager that wouldnt left me transfer back, set me up for failure and refused to let me quit."
good,a typical work consist of helping customers find products with having great customer service. Stock shelves for customers satisfaction put misplaces products back where they belong. Help keep the store clean of spills to keep customers safe of injury.
good,"No room for advancement, delayed and misleading benefits, no set schedule and making under state minimum wage because of Union dues. "
good,"Cruddy inconsistent hours where you rarely get more than a day off in a row and consistently schedule your shifts only 10 hours apart.  In one of the most expensive county's in my state to live in, getting paid so low should be criminal.  Union dues, benefits (could be a good expense if you need the insurance), and taxes make your take-home less than half what you make."
good,"Safeway could be a good place to work if they had better management and took their hiring process serious.  A lot of the people who were ""upper management""  didn't really consider themselves upper management.  They always went to one person who was never there to do his job.  A lot of arguments and conflicts occurred between employees that was overlooked but gossiped about.  The managers for certain departments weren't very professional.  They also have you sign up for part-time but give you a full-time schedule.  You aren't allowed to call out sick or if you have emergencies they deem not important.  They have a relatively young staff but only pay a handful of their employees that are over 60 overtime and they get double pay on holidays and weekends.  The union isn't helpful but they take $10-$11 from your paycheck every week.  Corporate comes in the store and that's when you see management get more active.  It's a sad place to work and I would never recommend this establishment to anyone I know."
good,Lots of picking up other people’s slack so you basically do your job and somebody else’s without really getting paid for it. Takes a lot for them to fire you.
good,This wasnt a good fit for me as someone on the Autism Spectrum.In general because of management people are not happy working there. Many coworkers leave the place. They are overworked/stressed
good,"I had never worked in a grocery store before, so it was a big learning experience for me. It was a fast paced job where there was always something to do, something to clean, a customer to help, food to prepare. As a deli clerk we prepared foods for the displays; sliced meats and cheeses per customer orders; prepared sandwiches for customers; washed dishes; prepared and cooked whole roasted chickens; and cleaned wherever it was needed, to name a few. The hardest part of the job was the unstable scheduling. Yet, seeing new customers each day and working with my co-workers was the best part."
good,At the beginning Safeway was a great place to work at but after a year everyone started to be rude to me and stopped talking to me and would get me into trouble for no reason so I had to quit because i was not happy.
good,The job was okay. Management wasn't that great. The pay is minimum wage and not enough for everything we do. The hours get cut even with having full time hours for a long time
good,I enjoyed my position and the people that I worked with. Our upper management had clear favorites and only advanced people they favored. The managers did not appreciate the people that really deserved it.
good,"management are not well trained to manage an entire store, workers get zero training as cashiers. union does barely anything but complain. managers are always right in hr's eyes."
good,"Was a decent work environment, but management would not address issues between coworkers or address coworker related issues (no call no show/tardiness), equipment would not be properly fixed/tended to, but everyone besides management was pleasant and attentive"
good,"I was desperate for a job when they threw me a life line 2 years ago, but now they take more from me emotionally, mentally, and physically than they give back to me in terms of financial security. I'm definitely at the end of my line for this line of work, and I don't see the negative work environment around there improving due to corporate meddling."
good,"safeway is a alright place it was an amazing first job for the year and half but there was no advancement, not till it was my last day they offered me a postion higher up that i asked for three months in advanced."
good,Generally I did not enjoy my time at safeway although i stayed for two years. It was very easy work and I enjoyed most of my customers. I didn't approve of the management style or really the works atmosphere.
good,This was my first job. I have mixed opinions about this establishment. I didn't work here long enough to develop a negative opinion about this place. My coworkers were cool.
good,The managers don't take home life into consideration and are very quick to write people up for minor mistakes. Not enough hours or a consistent schedule.
good,"Safeway is an okay place to work. Be prepared to have a workout. Full time employees work from 6:30am-4:30pm. Lots of lifting, and customer service skills are much needed."
good,"I learned customer services skills.  I really enjoyed working with the customers and during my tenure with Safeway developed friendships with other employees and customers.  "
good,i was a deli clerk and it was the worse food service job I have had in my entire working adult life. Staff was nice but the environment was stressful. Felt like I wasn't properly trained or given enough time to be trained.
good,Good company that gives you hours if you need them. Good benefits that also give you paid time off once you earn them. You get personal holidays and sick pay
good,"Most of the co-workers are easy to get along with, but as with all retail stores, they are quite understaffed at night."
good,Working for Safeway is a full time job. Many demands from management that are sometimes unrealistic. Co workers do what they have to do on a daily basis. High energy needed for this position
good,"-Depending on the department it was fast paced, you deal with a lot "
good,This all applies to the store that I worked at specifically. The manager is greedy and is only worried about herself. Same with the produce manager who behaves unethically and immorally.
good,"- 8 hour shifts"
good,"The management there wasn't the best. They would rather hire new people instead of giving you more hours. The coworkers were friendly, but management was very rude and uptight."
good,This was simply a job. Some of the staff was very friendly and assisted when needed. I didn't get much job training before they threw me on the floor.
good,its ok not a happy place most are lifers and are just waiting so they can retire. Company has no caring for the employees that I could see. some managers in the departments are lazy
good,"The only problem I had with Safeway is the mistreatment by supervisors and lack of training by management. Also, Safeway's is technology is ancient. "
good,"providing food delivery service for customers in hourly time schedules. loading and loading truck per delivery manifest ."
good,"Safeway as a whole is a beautiful place to work at, from the beautiful women that fill the Starbucks to the beautiful fruits and vegetation in the produce section,"
good,"wasn't treated well"
good,"It was an okay job, but the pay was not that good. The management was not good, they would let days pass by before they replaced things that we needed in the deli even after we asked."
good,"Working with Safeway was amazing... until Sobeys bought it out. I had 8 hours a day, 40+ hours a week, benefits, and there was a raise every 500 hours worked and I was part time. Now (still working part time) I only have up to 7.5 hours a day, less than 28 hours a week. No benefits and I do not get the raise every 500 hours because I cannot put in enough hours."
good,"A typically day was making  sure the line was short.The management there was very unorganized. Sometimes,the management can come off as being rude . They don't consider the fact that some people rely on other people to get to and from work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"typical day was bagging groceries, stocking shelves, cleaning bathrooms and collecting carts. management was hectic and very often rude to the workers"
good,"Average paced job, not a lot of responsibilities. okay compensation. Okay management. "
good,"If you do it right, you can move up quickly. Don't get stuck in a department. You will be there forever. Management is okay, varies by store. Union is helpful."
good,The company put me in any department that was short staffed to try to save money. Every day I was learning a new department
good,"Run away now.  It used to be a good place, but since Albertson's took over, they went straight  downhill. I am coming up on 11 years with the company, worked hard, sacrificed family time, have a stellar attendance record and am being treated with no consideration at all.  They will not make good on any hours/ shifts/ days off you are promised.  It doesn't matter how good you are, they are just waiting to replace you with some kid for minimum wage."
good,"Working at safeway is tough. You usually work long shifts on your feet, but if you're lucky you work at a store that isn't always packed with customers and managers scrambling to open more registers. Can be a nice job if your store has it all together. You do get vacation pay though based on how many hours you work"
good,"A typical day at work would be going in making food, helping customer, the manager expecting to do everything when they know they can help a little and they clean for about 2 hours after the shift with just 2 people."
good,I have worked here for a very long time and I have never wanted out so bad. New local corporate treat  the employees so bad its ridiculous. very belittling and demeaning.
good,"Pros: "
good,"Allowed me to have flexible hours as a full time college student, I enjoyed working with my coworkers and working as a barista."
good,"Working at Safeway has taught me patience.  The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying and working with the customers. However it is difficult to work in an unorganized environment. I meditate before work which makes the day go by smoother. "
good,"While working for Safeway Pharmacy in Homer, Alaska, I enjoyed the beautiful scenary and the wonder people.  A typical day of work was many new stories from our customers of homesteading and fishing."
good,This was a place where I could be myself in a positive work environment while providing efficient customer service. Felt like a team effort amongst coworkers.
good,It's all fine to work for a strict company but if you got in with your friends and you're having a hoot listening to stuff with your friends or even being a little different than you are at work while OFF the clock you can be fired almost instantly.
good,"The management of my current job (Safeway) is terrible. The workload is almost always consistent of being thrown on to any and everybody. Scheduling is not taken into careful consideration of the employees. The store is in constant disarray. The customers are usually rude because of the service given as well as the consistent amount of problems such as a constant backup of customers when purchases are being made, product markings being incorrect or have not been revised to the correct sale price, items not being in stock, and many more problems. The hardest part of it all as far as being a cashier is concerned is not having the proper tools needed to assist in making things much less complex than they should be. Systems are outdated. There are electrical problems with check stands. two out of the 11 check stands do not work. It's usually never a good day to work here. If anything, the only good thing I can say about this job is that my co-workers/peers are the only part of my job that make it slightly easier as well as enjoyable."
good,"The managers are not easy to talk to, booking days off was a horrid process that sometimes ended in getting in trouble for not showing up when I had the day booked off. We were disciplined for chating with our co-workers while preparing things. It was a simple job but they expected one person to be able to do a lot more than capable."
good,"Every day is the same. You get on a till, you must endure tens of snobby customers daily just to be yelled at by the supervisor at the end of the day. Co-workers are generally alright, however, the management is awful and disorganized. Smiling for six hours and pretending to be genuinely interested in a customer's life is definitely that hardest part. The most enjoyable part is going home."
good,"There is not much good I can say about working for Vons. Most of their expectations are unrealistic. They expect things done in time frames that only allow for sloppy and quick work. The managers don't have much tolerance for unmet time-frames too. Not to mention the fact that while on one of these time restricted duties, they still expect you to stop and say hello and/or help every single customer you come within 5 feet of."
good,working at Safeway I love my co-workers management is poor does not seem to appreciate workers supervisors are great to work with very understanding the hardest part of the job is the constant change of hours and days scheduled. The most enjoyable is working with great people and great costumers.
good,"I liked this job in the sense that it kept me busy, I had no down time which was great for me, co-workers were awesome to work with. It was a fun and enjoyable job."
good,Too many floater pharmacists to get sufficient hours.  No benefits due to hours being short.
good,"My co-workers weregreat, but that's about as far as it goes, they pay well below the m,arket average and the focus on employees is very outweighed by the focus on upper mgmt ""chest puffing"""
good,"It's not a challenging job, but the hours tend to suck, and you're at the whim of corporate decisions with little say and no input. It's a decent job for kids and retirees, but not full-time professionals."
good,this was an alright job. way over worked and not enough staff to keep it running properly
good,Good job for a someone wanting a first job. I used to enjoy working here but management should talk to the the employees with more respect.
good,they want you to be on call all the time. they cut your hours whenever and they don't treat you the way a company should treat an employee.  
good,"in 12 years there were NO full-time jobs, pension plan was not overly abundant."
good,"collecting carts,greeting"
good,"picking orders here means talking into a head set that tells you what to pick and stack on a pallet all day. pallets get stacked taller than you and are very easy to tip when driving on electric pallet jack. basically don't talk to anyone all day and breaks are at a set time and end at a set time so if you aren't out working the second break ens it eats into you order picking time and gives you bad percentage at the end of the day, same with going to the bathroom."
good,"I work as a front end checker. I have part-time status. Extreme micromanaging. Disrespect from most managers, not dept. managers. Hard to make a living with part time work. Very hard work physically and mentally. It's service work, and sometimes the only work available in this town."
good,"If you don’t have a long time with the company, your basically scraps. There is no really room to grow or achieve anything. It’s just a bypassing job."
good,Major reason for living was that it was understaffed and didn't allow time off for employees who already worked previous holidays on full-time shifts. Unfair scheduling.
good,"Small store in small close knit community. Great experiences with customers and employees, enjoying all the new, younger staff being hired, mostly students and retired professionals"
good,"I like my job,  my work, just not how I'm sometimes allowed to be treated poorly.  the Negitive  environment, Negitive  coworkers/ and manager. No appreciation for any of the work that you do ."
good,"I loved working with the community and all my co-workers were amazing. The public and town were sweet"
good,"The work was easy although there was a lot of it. I was barley trained, and I had to figure it out myself a lot. Costumers and coworkers were very rude."
good,"Good work environment, friendly coworkers. Not too bad of a job, strict manager that a lot of people disliked, but this particular manager retired. Overall an ok experience, enjoyed working for the company."
good,"Depending upon the particular manager you have the opportunity to work with, your level of training will certainly vary. Be sure to ask questions, if you are unsure"
good,The union does nothing to help when management doesn't follow the rules. This store is used as punishment by corporate for managers they want to quit. The store suffers in turn.
good,"they need to have a more relaxed atmosphere, have more youth working and that the gossip is strictly prohibited."
good,"i had very little time there due to the fact that after i was hired Safeway went into a hiring freeze."
good,"The people within the department I work in are a great group of people, and my department manager is fantastic. But upper store management is out of touch about what each department can and should be doing."
good,It was a fast paced place to work that always seemed under staffed so there was a lot of things to do before you got off work. If you did finish all your work before your shift was done then you got some downtime.
good,Fast paced and normally stay busy all day. Able to help co-workers if they need help. Management works well with employees if they have a family emergency or medical appointments.
good,They treated you like a teenager and a kid while also expecting you to know everything already. They barely trained me and put me on the job and the most of the workers were grumpy and were not very accommodating. Some management would be okay but most of the time the place was a wreck and not a good working environment. If you are a teenager or getting your first job it is okay but other than that I do not recommend this job.
good,I enjoy working with the employees in all departments at Safeway.  The scheduling is not what I prefer.  It is difficult to plan ahead in my personal life due to the scheduling.
good,Working at Vons Dot.com you never know if you will get hours or not. Most of the time I work up 3- 4 hours a day. If we are busy then i at least 6 hours but never pass 8 hours.
good,no room for advancement didn't get paid well for working before store even opened 3am every morning. store manager was mean and rude. bakery manager was mean and unorganized and lazy
good,"typical grocery store job, not happy about the tier system they have for raises. Love all my coworkers, just how corporate policies work, there is nothing anybody can do about it."
good,"its a great starting job. you make good friends, and the job is easy. management is very inconsiderate about the scheduling. you work very little hours, schedule is always different every week, and you get paid minimum wage with no room too advance."
good,I didnt really see a point in being a courtesy clerk since most people wanted to bag their own stuff and all they end up doing is collecting carts or cleaing.
good,"The hardest part of the job was cleaning the bathrooms, that wasn't really me but i did it. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
good,Loved working for safeway was great for secondary job 10 to 28 hours a week. However they try to keep everyone frim full time so there are no benifts to part time
good,I applied as a cashier. At first I was working 40 hours a week. Then the hours started dropping. Then I was being placed in areas I was untrained in and never applied for. I quit.
good,"I worked at Safeway when people still got raises and a high wage at that time. I left to take care of my children because the hours were from 8am-11pm or you were restricted and lost hours. "
good,"There is a general sense of negativity in store employees including department managers and general store management due to corporate numbers and attitudes that wont change.  This creates a strain on job moral that shows in declining sales, work productivity, and customer reviews."
good,"Inconsistent work schedule "
good,"There was a culture of favoritism at the store that I worked at. The store manager was Latin, as was the Deli department's manager and assistant manager. They were prejudiced against non-Latins."
good,The customers were the best part of the job - I truly miss them.  The management was the worst part of my job.  I really liked my co-workers and enjoyed operating the register and even bagging.
good,"As an employee at Safeway, you will find out soon how bad management is. The lack of them being useful puts a toll on the work environment and makes things stressful."
good,"Was considered a full-time job and did not get full-time hours. Unorganized, and no training... Management was unorganized, and not around when needed."
good,i was part time and this was a second job. prefer not to answer any other questions because i feel my opinion may be biased based on the fact the company wouldnt grant me enough hours to sustain myself
good,The way shifts are set up in the deli makes it so teamwork to complete tasks is basically impossible. It's just bad management. Fast paced. Only a 10% discount and you have to sign up a certain way online.
good,"During my time at Safeway I thought I preformed very well, as a cashier it is a goal to be very customer friendly and consistent. I was both of these, still I never got over 20 hours a week. Sometimes, I would just get as little as 4 hours a week, if any. I just wish I could've worked more hours before I had to leave."
good,"- very busy day at work"
good,"Typically a regular day the manager would be late and then yell at other employees for being even 5 minutes late. Not the best place to work overall. The hours were ridiculous, one could be working at 1pm one day then called in at 4 am the next day."
good,"Overall it was an okay place to work. However, we were short staffed overworked which made the job very stressful. But, I loved my coworkers they were amazing people who were very understanding"
good,I'd have enoyed it but i got the raw end of the deal with coworkers. Some are great. some made ripping my own teeth out with a pair of dull pliars ideal in comparison to their presence
good,"If you are a Teenager or Single parent needing to get on your feet in the working world, Safeway is a great place to start. "
good,"The store was in between two managers at the time so the switch was awkward. The original manager had worked there for a long time (a few decades) and was hardly there at the tail end of it. The new manager, and the second in command (who did the scheduling) spent an enormous time talking to customers instead of their employees. Second in command would humiliate some of the employees at front end by raising her voice, over distances, for what should be professional private conversations on a semi-regular basis. Several employees were there simply because they had no replacement, but several complaints filed from their co-workers about them as well as occasionally section managers from other Safeways coming in to attempt to sway employees for the better."
good,"Only thing that made worth working here was my peers. You don't get a dime off anything or any perks at all. Sometimes you pay more than a dissatisfied customers would. Although hours are consistent and easy to get, there is no room for advancement or recognition for other jobs. A lot of customers give you attitude for no reason (but expected since so much traffic). We always seemed understaffed. Management is okay but don't want to deal with problems."
good,"Easy Work, people are willing to teach. Customers are main focus and making them have a posuve experience . Great Co-Workers, On the job Training,and employee discounts."
good,"Depends where you work. day of work depends on your attitude. learned a lot, managment sucks, workplace depends who you work with, hardest part of job was  coworkers, enjoyable part was when you worked with the right people."
good,"While working at Safeway, I had to earn my seniority (about 8 months of working there) to be able to have more than 20 hours per week. "
good,"They give the drivers a lot of freedom, besides mandatory lunches. The GPS follows your movements and speed, so its better to follow the road rules. The manager was fair, until you got on her bad side."
good,Management could've been better. The lack of communication helped foster a stressful environment. There were mix-ups all the time between managers and team members. There wasn't a cohesiveness amongst the managers and it played out amongst the team members.
good,"I was trained in 3 different positions at Safeway, bakery, floral and cashiering. Bakery taught me how to work very efficiently and in a clean area. My hours were 2 am- 11 am, they were brutal, probably the hardest part of this job. I worked with intelligent ladies who had been working the bakery for 20+ years and they taught me a lot of what I know, I definitely learned how to manage my time with many tasks. I enjoyed being able to take a lot of pride in my delicious product I was supplying for my guests. I transferred Safeway's due to a move, and I was then trained in the floral department. I had one of the best managers in this department. I learned to put a personal twist into some of my arrangements with talking to my guests and hearing about what they are going through or celebrating and I could create a beautiful product for them from my heart. Cashiering was very fast paced and not the best training, luckily for me, I have cashiering training (was a bit rusty, but I trained myself for the most part.) I appreciate my time with Safeway because I learned a lot about myself and my work ethics."
good,"I felt like I was lied to from the start.  Interviewed for a cashier position and was asked to do the bookkeeper position because I am good with numbers. I was surprised to see that the hourly wage was less then that of a cashier, so I was reluctant to accept the job.  I was told that after 6 months I could request a pay increase, but after 6 months was told that was not allowed. Basically told two different things by two different managers!"
good,Would have enjoyed the job more if management was more supportive and not always criticizing my work. Enjoyed the interaction with the customers and the conversation with them.
good,"Didnt like pay wasnt willing to give raise. Wouldn't work with hours. Needed that because of my kids. Manager was not to friendly, some other co workers werent very friendly"
good,"Company says they want to please the customers but it is truly only upper management. Expectations set for stores is too stressful to maintain.Customer surveys are only counted for a good ranking, customer opinions don't really matter"
good,"Great team atmosphere, clear goals and duties.  Variety of work to complete on a daily basis, good work place culture.  Lots of opportunity. In touch with local charities."
good,"Working at a safeway was a very crowded working experience, too few young people, slow moving, at times was dead, wrong working hours, non-flexible hours"
good,The store was doing awful at the time.Management all around the store was bad.Pay and hours were great but the people there weren't worth working for.
good,I didn't work at Safeway long and I wouldn't work there again. I worked the Customer Service desk when they still rented videos. That was the most fun.
good,"Every day went by the same, check the meat case, grind beef we needed, answer customer questions. My direct manager was ok, however, the store manager was shady and untrustworthy."
good,"Never knowing if you will receive a break, dealing with customers who try to get discounts on products. Deal with fake money and or checks/ cards that do not process."
good,Learned a lot about multiple aspects of the job from this company and was given plenty of freedom to manage my area as needed though was never given the tools or help to do so.
good,This job was sketchy as heck.  I had to be sent to the E.R because there has a heroin needle in the trash can. Would not recommend working at that place .
good,Working here for a year had its ups and downs. Really friendly coworkers. Management didn't show much care for the other workers though. Customers were mostly really nice. Doing various positions was nice duo to not being stuck doing the same thing over and over again.
good,"Management expected too much out of employees and not enough pay"
good,My manager was fantastic however upper management was awful. You got weird an inconsistent hours and you never got overtime. It was very fast pace and you never felt like there was time to get everything done and they put me on closing after working there for a very short time. The most enjoyable part was the costumers and my manager. They made the job tolerable.
good,"The job was necessary to pay for university but the management had several people more interested in making themselves look good than actually managing (or in some cases, actually carry out minor personal attacks in front of customers)"
good,"My duties required me to be an all around worker, duties was basically whatever they ask me to do as a service clerk from pulling trash, to stocking groceries, to gathering grocery carts etc,etc,I also performed special duties when asked by my supervisor."
good,"I can't say that Safeway was a very enjoyable place to work for me. I am an introvert at heart and being in customer service is not my strong suit. I was only a cashier so my duties consisted of helping customers checkout items picked up in the store."
good,"I worked hard to find my place in the company, I loved working with the stores customers and had I been paid more or had more hours I would've loved to have stayed there. "
good,"After working here for a long period of time I would prefer to never work in customer service ever again. "
good,I learned how to send and accept Western Union and lottery tickets and games. The rest of the day was customer service and doing returns and counting the tills and safe and doing bank drops and change machines. I loved seeing my regulars everyday and taking care of the customers that make our community.
good,"Safeway/Albertsons is a bottom-line company focused on the dollar and little on the employee. Even though they advertise comparative wages, they typically are far below local competitors. Stress on upper management often trickles down to hourly employees causing low store moral."
good,"Not efficient, unprofessional, not understanding of student life. Too crazy and unorganised. i learned how to be a cashier and work on self checkout. I stalked isles and provide customer service, I sold cigarettes to customers."
good,I have not work here very long but enjoy the atmosphere and the people.  Would like to see more shifts and more training or coaching when issues arise
good,"Safeway is a pleasant place to work compared to most companies. We had our own union and we also received 1 week paid vacation every year. Also, we got paid every week which was nice. Most employees were very kind, honest and dedicated to their job. The hardest part about the job was dealing with difficult customers, but there are some regular customers there that make it worthwhile."
good,"This is a job that expects way more from you then what you are payed to do (minimum wage). You are also not guaranteed hours or a specific schedule. You are there to do whatever they want regardless of what position you are in. Due to this there is a constant flow of new people coming and going."
good,"I didnt particularly like working at safeway. the management was strict even when I was doing my best and nothing ever really seemed to be good enough. there wasnt a ""team"" working there."
good,"The job itself is easy, depending on your department. You just have to find where you fit in. Your shifts can vary from 4 hours to 8 hours. You are required to be part of the Union. Management over the store as a whole is decent, individual department managers vary. The hardest part of the job is finding where you fit in and then getting approval to move to that department. Most enjoyable part is the employees you meet."
good,"Very fast paced work. Have to catch on quickly. Management were very strict and pretty less merciful. The culture workplace was fun and pretty hectic. The hardest part of the job was being accurate with everything you do. The orders, the payments, the customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was definitely my co-workers. Just being able to talk with them kind of took my mind off the tedious work, as well as day to day customers."
good,"Its a okay place to work for a little while, but not for a career. Management is not that great but they can get the job done. A little overwhelming trying to take on things that managers do when your just a clerk making a little over minimum wage."
good,A lot of people issues at safeway.  I've worked in several different positions and all of them were filled with prima donnas.
good,"Working at the Brighton Safeway was the most frustrating job I have worked. Trying to balance out school work and work was extremely difficult, and management was not the most flexible when it came time to ask for time off because of school activities. Management also did not pull their share when it came to customer servicing; they piled the work onto other associates already busy. Finally, the pay employees received was very, very low for the amount of work being completed."
good,If you wanna work everyday of almost every week from October to February then the Safeway warehouse is for you. Everyday you have to be moving at full speed everything is timed you don't make your time you can get fired .It's a good paying job but it's hard on the back
good,hard worker and unloader. we unload trucks and we break them down on pallets. management was short handed and we had no help
good,"Safeway was always very busy and I grew accustomed to the ration of customers to checkers on the front end, as in we never had enough checkers. I enjoyed my coworkers and our antics to get through the day together, all the while often slammed. It taught me a great deal about patience and going the extra mile even if no one will notice the effort. It helped reaffirm my steadfast belief in compassion and conscious choice of thought. There are a lot of aspects I would change at Safeway, namely, treating all employees equally."
good,"It was a fun lay back job, but still being able to accomplished our daily task. the co-workers were the best part of the day. But sadly the store I had experienced this at is now closed."
good,Hours are not set in stone and they are part of a union and have to pay fees prior to receiving any benefits. Hours would change weekly without prior authorization. Found it difficult to plan activities and appointments.
good,"This job was pretty fun at first, but once I learned how to do everything, I didn't feel like there was anything left to learn."
good,"The work wasn't hard, simple unloading the boxes, stocking the shelves, labling. Checking the meat. But the opposing shifts would always leave extra unnecessary work because of lack of communication."
good,"As bookkeeper/ customer service clerk I dealt with all the money matters while balancing out working with customers that needed assistance. "
good,"A typical day of work, I would run through the store Literally, Trying to figure out my schedule. I learned to work in a fast paced environment. The management was poor, lack of communication skills all around.The hardest part of the job was pushing carts. Most enjoyable part of the job was Helping customers."
good,"Typical day at work goes by quick because you remain busy. There is always something to do. You never have time to just sit/stand around."
good,"Although I enjoy my job and the customers, I am very disappointed in both the management and the corporation as a whole. Unfortunately, Safeway does not hire full time unless you are a manager. But, they no longer offer the coarse work to obtain management status. There is no potential for growth. "
good,the coworkers are nice but its a bad place to work if you have a family. i enjoyed the job but lefting and cleaning while i was pregnant made working there very hard
good,"A typical work day includes helping customers, utilizing a cash register to handle a variety of transactions, and handling customer inquiries."
good,I work very hard but they do not acknowledge anyone but themselves. They dont treat their employees fairly. i still tough it out be nice and respect them though and do everything they ask
good,"I started out a courtesy clerk then i moved up to a cashier, I was there for almost 2 years and i only received a 25 cent raise.  I gained a lot of customer service skills but their was no other room for advancment"
good,Working for this company is not all that I thought it would be. It is very stressful and fast paced. The managers aren't very good. The pay here is terrible for the job being done.
good,This is a place where your performance is kind of irrelevant. Advancement is based solely on seniority with little consideration to the individual's performance. My fellow coworkers were great. No complaints there. It's the management that leaves much to be desired.
good,"My manager would only give me the contract amount of hours, and on my days off, wanted me to cover everyone's shifts since I was the only one that was reliable and could get the job done. Awful Management, great employees. Courtesy Clerks are worked like slaves though and will make you do things not in your contract."
good,"The pat sucks, but it is better than being jobless and homeless. It is a typical job in the grocery industry. You are expected to work at a super human pace day in and day out. District management keeps reducing the number of labor hours while increasing the expected workload."
good,"Typical day would be making all the daily runs throughout the store, maintaining check ins and maintaing the store. I learned customer service. The co workers were good people. The hardest part was closing,  the most enjoyable was helping the older people"
good,Safeway is a good company to work for. It all depends on which store you work for on how many hours you get per week. The company has come a long way from when they where paying minimum wage. If you looking for a job that with give you experience and over work you. Than come to Safeway. Plz know that certain departments you will be busy from the time you clock in to the time you get off.
good,"started the day cleaning the car park, helped bring in deliveries, filled  shelves , general cleaning, management were very demanding on everything had to be done to perfection, the hardest part of the Job was  the cleaning of the produce, Meat and Dairy chillers! I got on well with my co workers! The most enjoyable part of the job serving the customers!"
good,Safeway was an alright place to work. I didn't really like it because it was a to far distance to travel. There wasn't no hard part of the job really. I looked forward to giving small conversation to the customers.
good,A typical day at work would either start at 7:00 Am or 3:00 Pm where I would then stock and shelve about 25 loads of flowers. I would set the department up to look appealing and follow the merchandising rules which I learned from my manager. I would have two breaks and depending on the day would go home at 3:30 Pm or 8 Pm. I learned how much to water the flowers and how to transfer and merchandise our plants into pots in the department. I used the chashier and helped customers find products as well as inflate balloons for the department and the entire store. Management was challenging at times but we have a great team and all work hard together. Working with management was hard to get set hours for the weekly schedule. While working I look forward to learning about the new flowers that we get and how to merchandise and display the flowers to look the best they can. Another enjoyable part about this job is interacting with the customers and delivery great results.
good,The people were nice but the management was all over the place. The employees seemed to do whatever they wanted and the management did little to work with the employees that actually worked.
good,I enjoyed working with the customers on their homeshopping accounts. Making sure their coupons were added to their orders.correctly. The best part was resolving issues for the elderly customers
good,"Safeway doesn't pay low positions in the company nearly enough money to survive. Even though the management and work environment was decent, I wouldn't recommend that anyone work there until minimum wage raises (honestly)!!"
good,I love the team I work with and will miss them once my position is eliminated. I fear pieces of the company are going to be sold off.
good,"Was a very challenging job, that was fast paced and I enjoyed it, but the pay and hours were less then desirable. Same expectations daily on the processes need to run well, but also had something different everyday to handle as well."
good,"I found my experience at Safeway, although tolerable, uninspiring and rather negative. with little room for advancement, or cooperation between employees it became increasingly difficult to proceed with working there."
good,"There's not much I can say for Safeway, especially after the 2003-2004 strike. The company just ain't what it used to be before, or at least as I was told. Working in the grocery field used to be a respectable job, where you could work your entire professional life, retire and live happily. This is not the case anymore. Now that they've taking away most, if not all, the great benefits, and the pay scale, which takes 13+ years to max out at only 19-ish dollars, you can see that this company is only a shadow of its former self. The turn over rate is astronomical, you used to go into a store and always see the same friendly faces and now it's like a new store every month or so. I rarely shop at Safeway now, I prefer companies, like Costco or Sprouts, that value their employees and pay them respectable wages, and offer full time employment."
good,Worked in the deli where I kept the hot cases full for customers at all times of the day. Also stocked shelves to keep product stocked.
good,Not a fun experience very low pay to be told to do alot of tasks and when a customer wants to tip you for your hard work you are not allowed to accept it.
good,"I can work with a daily routine but when it is very labor intensive as far as lifting 50lb meat boxes all day it can get very tiring. As well as closing every night and having to clean up the kitchen I find it difficult to wake up early and have energy to do things. "
good,"The work in itself here was simple enough, but the team was dreadful. Management didn't train very well. They just showed you videos and expected you to do everything perfectly the first time. And they don't advise you or try to help you succeed. Breaks weren't very long for how taxing on your physical health the work is."
good,"too much to list,will never work at another safeway ever.stupid people in charge lazy co workers"
good,"I learned a lot while working here for over 3 years. but, in the end, it wasn't for me. tough place to work. people i worked with weren't that great. advancing and being promoted is extremely difficult. the hardest part of the job was working a lot, not a lot of off time."
good,Not a very good job to advance and make a career. Cashier was my job title.
good,Management in uncertain enviroment since buyout. been here since i was 16 learned everything from them
good,I have workd at safeway for almost a year now and they are a horrible company to work for and they are very hard to stay committed to.
good,"management is suppose to take care of their employees, but if you dont have the right attractive looks management treats you horrible. looks trumps experience and work ethic"
good,"Its really busy usually each work day, especially during the hours of 3-7pm. The supervisors and managers try to help out as much as they can if their able. The hardest part of the job is having so much expected of you and not really being compensated for it."
good,"At this job I learned how to manage angry customers,how to take a managers prospective to things,how to properly run a grocery store. Even though i gave them a low rating, my store was pretty nice."
good,"A typical work day consist of collecting shopping carts from the parking lot, cleaning bathrooms and stocking shelves."
good,Safeway is a beneficial place to work when you are in a low-income budget
good,its a ok job. Very business place to work at. If you want to make a career out of it. Try to become a supervisor they ge pay ok
good,"I really enjoyed the customers, I learned how to prepare food trays, and how to run a cash register, I worked with a great group of people. The hardest part of the job was the hours, they were always different with different days of and that was hard with a very young child."
good,I learn the techniques of how to deal with difficult customers
good,"the most enjoyable part of the day was being outside. the hardest part was doing go backs. management was iffy. and co-workers were fun to be around most of the time, but to much drama."
good,working at safeway is working at Safeway. You go do your job and after your finish go home.
good,"they were poorly run, and not very organized management didnt listen to employees very well not a company i would want to work for again."
good,"Safeway wasn't the brightest spot in my work history thus far but I learned a valuable lesson. My reserved personality didn't help me prosper. The co-workers were probably the worst part of the job. There was a lot of talk about other employees, for example, I knew I was getting let go about a week or so before it even happened. It was clear few liked working there, which made the environment difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was cart hour even when someone else didn't do their part and I had to work extra hard to get the number of ""free carts"" back down to the acceptable amount. The supervisor and assistant manager were cool, the store manager was a bit of a brute."
good,Typically a good work environment but occasional micro management.  I left this job to get back into the real estate field.
good,"Stock, help with customers, put back carts."
good,"A good work place to gain experience. Fast pace, and organized. Sales were enforced everyday. Uniforms, and grooming were important. Multitasking was key to getting the job done, as well as customer satisfaction."
good,no room for moving up
good,"Once you learn how to make the dishes you never have to buy them again because you're the pro. unless you don't have the time. The customers can be demanding and many times you'll be the only one operating the entire department most of the day. Working holidays here is horrible. Once, a guy was furious and complained to the manager of the department yelling because he expected his thanksgiving turkey to cook fully in the microwave...He ordered a ""Thanksgivin box"" full of items that one would cook on the holiday and was upset we didn't cook it all for him."
good,It has been too long since I worked at Safeway. I cannot remember it too well.
good,great place with lovely people
good,"Safeway was once a great place to work. Unfortunatly, the last several years have seen many changes that have dramatically changed the dynamics between management and hourly employees."
good,"A typical day at work at this job consist of bagging groceries, getting shopping carts from the parking lot, cleaning up the store. I learned my customer service skills from this job. The management and leadership at this job could've been more professional. I had really good co-workers at this job. The hardest part of this job was pushing all of shopping carts at one time while cleaning the parking lot. The most enjoyable thing about this job was just working at safeway, because it was my first real job."
good,"I get into work and check the ""carts & sweeps"" log to see when I will need to be in the parking lot collecting carts and when I need to be inside doing my sweeps around the store. Then depending on my schedule I am either sweeping, collecting carts or bagging customers groceries."
good,"Work five days out the week. Stayed busy all day, a lot of things learned."
good,"After five years working as a florist I get to really appreciate what it like to be lucky enough to come into a job where you go in happy and leave happy as well.I have heard so many stories of joy, sadness, and celebration that has really shaped me as an individual.At times I struggle with myself because I love what I do I just don't like to atmosphere in which I do it.While this is a major downfall it is my ability to be creative and have fun that allows my to continue to do my work."
good,Management only cares for themselves and what the corporate office tells them to do. It’s like a power struggle for the lower class workers stuck in the retail world. Decent pay and decent benefits though. You just need to deal with a lot of b.s. from co workers management and customers. Goodluck if your seeking employment from the company. Decent stores may vary imo.
good,Leader ship culture ethics morals principles is out of proportion and people need to learn what it’s like back in the 1970s.  Back in the day never used to be like this generation is not the same When I was growing up. Better work ethic back in my day
good,"Working the night shift at Safeway was slow. The company that seemed to be based on a team aspect, couldn't be further from it. Had to learn everything the first night on my own with only using serial numbers to find placement for the products in hand. I would hope that it only had to do with the person training me and not an overall outlook of what to expect from working for the company. Upper management had to be the only pleasant time talking to a coworker."
good,"My work was okay, I did my work normally and had put my best into my tasks. I wasn’t well paid though and my schedule was always small since they wouldn’t fit me in for school. The team there wasn’t very nice but I bared through it all."
good,It’s ok place  to work but I wouldn’t try and make a career the department managers I was with were really good but the store director is the complete opposite I can safely
good,"If you are a hard worker they will take advantage of you. Many months - working harder than anyone else doing the same job. My output was by far an away over expectations and not once did I get a pat on the back, any praise or a raise."
good,at first i was happy to work there i was getting grate hours and grate pay. i tried to put my best foot forword even on my bad days. but soon they started cutting hours like crazy. with conflicted with my school hours. made it hard to work and go to school.
good,"at Safeway I've learned to work in almost every department but only received a pay raise when the minimum wage went up, some managers are fair and decent, the job its self isn't stressful too much but the hours are completely random and leaves you barely any room for outside life. other employees there are wonderful people and hard workers but the best thing I've gotten from working there for two years are getting to know the people who I've worked with and the experience of working in all the departments"
good,Very unprofessional Management. Treat employees as if they are expendable I would never chose to work at another safeway or any other grocery store because of my experience
good,There was alot of work place hostility between coworkers.There didn't seem to be any resolution in dealing with it by management.In example: long term employees who were not held to the same standard as new employees.
good,"Good for experience and flexible hours (mostly). Management is in and out. Disrespect is popular among management. Steady hours are a benefit, but he pay is too little."
good,Me and the store manager did not get along from day 1. Got along with most the crew and management but felt singled out by the store manager. Felt trapped in my register as he constantly got after me for doing things that other checkers would do.
good,"Not much official training, but decent folks to learn from. The work is not particularly difficult, but feedback on performance is minimal. It happens, but only because some employees do so spontaneously--nothing structured."
good,"when I started I had 40/hrs a week then shortly after moved to part time which wasn't what I wanted.  training did not go well - felt isolated.  didn't feel comfortable with management handling issues within the store, poor time management. lots of lazy working. I don't think the merge with Albertsons went well for employees."
good,Safeway is full of customers who are either tired or just mean. Safeway should be a job for you if you need one desperately. Although I like the weekly payment.
good,"A typical day at work would be coming down and start facing shelves. If I was needed in the cooler, a colleague would let me know and I would re-stock the shelves with milk."
good,"- easy and fast paced "
good,If management was better I would of stayed! I had 12 years invested. Had many good memories and not so good. Can’t be a weak person working here cause they take advantage of it.
good,I got this job as a high school student and it was a good started job and got me the retail experience I needed to go on to something better. There was a lot of mindless tasks that had to be done.
good,Safeway is a good starter job. As an employee you need to be open to various schedules with no same day off each week. Your schedule changes weekly.  it is a very fast pasted work environment. You also need to be able to think and make decisions on job tasks on your own and multitask
good,Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.Too many people want to be managers but don't want to do the manual labor. Hours are ok in the summer. Winter time hours are not enough to live on
good,"I worked at the starbucks inside safeway in idaho, and found it very unfair that i was makig $5 less than your typical starbucks employee. i also was made to work while sick,."
good,"The workers around me were extremely lazy and did not care about their job. As a result, I had to pick up after them for everything that they didn't do, and after I told my managers about it they did nothing so I quit."
good,if you have nothing nice to say about safeway don't say anything about safeway at all.its a ok place to work if  your a student trying to make some extra money or a summer job.
good,The inconsistent and non trust in store level and mid level management is a major issue in a handful of locations. The fear and bullying are also a concern. The pay and benefits are for positions are comparbal to many other major grocery companies.
good,I worked at Safeway to be with people. That e was the only reason as I was retired at the time. Giving back to our little community was rewarding. I certainly didn't work for the money.
good,"The work days are busy, with the schedule having either too many cashiers working at once or too little, never an in between. I didn't learn much from working there but only because I already knew how to use a cash register, face aisles, and bag items. The job was difficult when it got busy. Management dislikes getting on registers, a few employees call out and don't show up without consequence more often than not. "
good,I was promoted when i asked to move up which was great.  Lots of unnecessary drama that i as a manager noticed effected the other employees in many ways.
good,"a typical day at safeway consisted of long lines through the aisles, not many cashiers working at the time so supervisors would get on the register while manger just told us what to do and never fixing any problems or he was never there."
good,Enjoying my commicating with customers and helping them. Cleaning services. Following through and understanding rules. On time and lunch break. Free lunches
good,The team I worked with was very helpful. No matter how you were struggling they made sure they made you feel like you’re part of the team. They will guide you and assist you as much as you need until you are comfortable with your current job position.
good,"Overall, working at Safeway was a fast-paced and educational experience where I got to learn the importance of customer service in the retail industry and how attention to detail in your work can do wonders. The management, on the other hand, showed me how to avoid work and treat your employees with less than what is known as respect."
good,I learned from my time in  Wenatchee Safeway  and my manager there was the greatest. Here in Spokane Safeway it was  a stressful situation and I was glad to quit.  Wished it had been better.
good,This was my first job ever and I stayed there for 2 years. It was a good first job for a high school student. I would recommend this as a first job for anyone.
good,I enjoy my job in the bakery but I don't get enough hours to pay my rent and utilities. The bakery manager is not easy to work with however i do enjoy baking. my co-workers are good to work with.
good,Safeway is a good job with good employees  some benefits and I would consider going back. They are flexible with hours and will fit your schedule to your lifestyle
good,"I was in charge of bagging groceries, greeting people as they walked in and out of the store, helped people out to thier car and loaded their groceries for them, and would retrieve carts from the parking lot."
good,Job has opportunity to move up in management also have opportunity to move up in pay and offers good health benefits and also gives you sick leave and helps employees out when it comes to doctors appointments
good,The people you work with are nice and fun people. It is convenient being paid weekly.  the discounts on groceries add up quite a bit which makes Safeway a little more cost effective for employees. The down side is that as a single mother closing every night really is not conducive as you are not home after the kids are out of school. Your children's welfare should always come first.
good,"I walk in seeing how much the morning crew did during the morning, after that I walk into the back to see if anyone else is there. If I don't see anyone I start on working on the holes in the wall and then work on tins."
good,"the ""training was on your own but required. you where always needing to be actively doing something even if it did not make sense."
good,"Poor pay, not enough hours little chance for advancement, schedule is only posted up to several days in advance. Safeway use to hire full time and at a good rate of pay back in the 80's before being purchased by Albertson's"
good,The supervisor could use a little help in communication other than that the last minute overtime call was not cool and being forced to stay is not good either
good,"I loved my job but I did not get paid enough for my position and was treated unfairly when it came to my responsibilities as a single mother. If the management was different, I would have stayed with Safeway."
good,"I think it's great for a first job, but not as a way to support yourself and/or a family. If you aren't in management, you may as well find another job. And once you're off of probation, you still do not qualify for benefits even if you are working full time."
good,"Enjoyable job if you like the public - very low pay for workload."
good,This job was a good job to gain job skills for a first time worker. The tasks were easy each day but became boring real quick. Most of the employees were good to work with and Management was decent. I was very thankful for this job as it got me through college.
good,"Most of the elderly workers are racist, management was very biased towards the elders. Most of the co-workers believe they have power over the youth, but at least the bathroom was kinda nice."
good,Shift work makes your job work/ life balance manageable.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people such as workmates and customers.  A typical day at work involves solving problems regarding customers and trying to satisfy their needs.
good,"If you are starting as cashier, parking lot cart pusher, Starbucks clerk, Grocery shelf stock person, Deli clerk and among other low wage earning jobs, please know that you wouldn't be making much. "
good,"This review is based on a company I have not worked for in over 6 years. The life of retail management is many hours and a challenge in the work/life balance."
good,"typical work place, head company itself doesn't know what it is like to live in these small communities and so has no idea what we need and the management should be allowed to make changes where needed"
good,Hours cut drastically and too many unrealistic goals given to you. promos pushed. constantly hounded about something. upper mamangement doesnt listen to concerns either
good,"normal day of work was about a 8hr shift that's consist of helping customers in the front slicing lunch meat, weighing and boxing salads ( potato salad, macaroni salad, broccoli salad, etc.) Also I was a cook which is in charge of cooking the rotisserie or oven roasted chicken, fry chicken, fry chicken wings, cook meatloaf, etc. The most enjoyable part of working at safeway was meeting new people and working with friends."
good,"As a food clerk, I deal with customers from beginning to end of the shift. It is important to make the customer a priority and always satisfy them. Everything is easy about working for Safeway."
good,"Id say its a good place to work, but the Management is very poor on how they deal with there employees. Very rude and not knowing how to approach someone."
good,"Having to pay union dues and not having any representation.Low wages, and no benefits unless you work a constant 40 hours. Shifts are I should say are not fair as the new hires are getting more than the others who have seniority. Closers are unwilling to help clean up the work  stations as needed. A lot of items are leaving the store as security is very lacks."
good,"Given that I was only there for such a short period of time, I am unable to provide much feedback regarding the company. I do know the incentives offered by the on site plant manager is not something the employees necessarily likes"
good,This is a great job for beginning to enter the work force and for people that like to be on their feet.  They are open from 6 am to 11 pm 7 days a week and operational 365 days a year.  The pace of the job directly correlates with the customers that come in on that particular day and what they buy.  Sales affect hours and if sales are down then hours get cut
good,"At the time I worked there, Subway was the only grocery shop that did not give any employee discount (you do get some insider coupon but with limitations and mostly not even good stuff). The schedule can be a mess. Working with the public is always a challenge. Sometimes you can be asked to perform functions that have nothing to do with your actual position. Money is as low as possible and you even pay union fees. The people are nice but of course that is variable. The music whole day can be annoying for some people. "
good,"The Safeway I worked at (Bothell, WA Safeway) was great mainly because it was just a summer job for me while waiting to go back to college. Many of my high school friends were working at that location and all my co-workers in my department (Meat/Seafood) were awesome!"
good,"It takes a unique person to be able to work overnight and also to work stocking freight. It's not the easiest but when you have the right people on the same shift, things get accomplished."
good,"For a 1st job, it is not bad. It is no longer a career position like it has been in the past. There is no full time except for the people who are now eligible to retire."
good,"I liked the people that I worked with. I did have a hard time with the assistant store manager, however the store manaager and I did get along. The location of the store was okay."
good,"My typical day at Safeway was very pleasant and most of the customers were pleasant as well. But working their i have learned that you can change a person day from bad to good just by saying something nice. The workplace culture was better then any job i have worked at, almost everyone was nice and friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of my job sometimes was trying to get through a 8 or sometimes 9 hour shift when my lunch wasn't given to me on time. I would be hungry in the last 5 hours of my shift. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing my customers by name and them remembering to come to me everytime i visited the store,that is when i was working of course. Making their day also made mine and that was the very most part i loved about working there."
good,"Expectations too demanding at times, too many unknowns about job security, training program is very weak, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with people"
good,"a typical day at work would consist of watering the plants, doing the load if there is one, cleaning the tables, refilling the buckets, checking for dead product, redoing the arrangements, refilling all the balloons in the card aisle and check stands with the themes it goes with, and making sure that everything is in its place. I learned how to take care of plants, how to make flower arrangements, and how to deal with difficult customers. Management always wants whats best for the company and doesn't care about the needs of the employees. The hardest part about this job would be all the tasks that needed to get done in a short amount of time while being the only one working. The most enjoyable part about this job is building a connection with customers, making arrangements or doing wraps for others and getting complimented on your work."
good,"As long as your co-workers and department managers can pull off their given tasks even moderately, Safeway is a great place to work."
good,You had to deal with threats from customers and the homeless everyday. And if you defended your self you were written up or had your hours cut. And you had to act as LP which was not part of the duties originally.
good,"Responsible for creating a colorful masterpiece of fresh crisp bright fruits and vegetables in an artistic fashion for our customers to enjoy."
good,"Hours range between 20-40 depending on holidays and your position. Management is pretty average from my experience in other retail chains. They're usually understaffed making work harder for the employees that are there. It's been five years since I've worked for them and they where aquired by Albertsons a few years ago so my knowledge is somewhat out of date. I have a friend in management at one of the stores who keeps me up too date on some things. Management pays very well. Regular associate positions do not. Safeway wasn't the worst experience I've ever had but definitely wasn't the best. They do offer advancement it's pretty rare though, as well as typical benefits like paid vacation after one year and healthcare. They are union and it's a requirement."
good,"On a typical work day busy at times other times it is slow. Management could be better, The cultures very here. Hardest part of job I would have to say is doing price changes overnight as the store is open 24 hours so it's hard to change prices because there is always customers around."
good,"Safeway is a good job to work at if it's your first job. After working at Safeway i realized that it wasn't a job i wanted to continue to balance with my life. It wasn't ""fun"" the hours were very difficult to fit too. and the environment became almost insulting."
good,I need something that will help me move forward in my life and support my children. At first I got to move forward in the company but then would have to take steps back. Safeway is not the place to be if you are trying to raise a family.
good,"As far as pharmacies go, safeway was ok to work for.  They lied about how many hours they were going to give me to start, but once they found out I was a talented employee my hours picked up."
good,"while working at safeway for more than a year i had asked to switch into a different department multiple times, asking for different departments because i was being told that the departments i was asking for were full. but literally the day after i had asked the manager and he had told me it was full, they hired someone else. That had happened to me twice there. The managers just really disrespect the employees."
good,Fast paced! Employees are overworked and management is never happy with employees productivity.  The store could be filthy and unstocked and all the mgmt. cares about is sales and customer service scores.
good,"This company is a great place to have a first job. It teaches you hard work and perseverance. I worked here over a year and the Co-Manager and Supervisor were awesome! There were a handful of co-workers with a positive attitude like me, but most of them were negative and some of them were very vulgar to boot."
good,"I liked working with the customers but the staff was treated a little poorly and they did alot of seniority type problems, the gossip was too much. I also couldnt handle the way the managers belittled and talked down to staff"
good,"I am not implying that I myself, am super intelligent or ""too good for the job"". I am simply describing every person whom I worked with and observed. Seriously, a chimpanzee with 'Downs Syndrome' could perform the tasks that ""management"" performs on a daily basis, with ease (I might add). If you encounter a person whose name rhymes with ""Bet"", show them a little sympathy, they are a decent individual deep down (divorces and 18 years of smoking can really get to someone)."
good,"I was hired as a temporary position, this particular Safeway hires only part time because of the location and business in that area.  I enjoyed working there but needed full time."
good,"As a driver, Being on the roads for hours could be stressful; traffic and others causes can make this job really hard to perform. Management does not take in count those situations. Stressful job."
good,"I like the job here but the pay is not competive at all. So to make ends meat i have to work 50 hours a week, very early in the morming. I want to enjoy life so I'm looking for better pay"
good,It is a fun place to work. An employee really does learn a lot.The manager is really great! The coworkers are really great too. It's also a great temp job too!
good,"The Managment isn't the best, people don't really do their jobs around there, they forget about school schedules all the time or completely ignore them."
good,"so breaks should be a little longer being as though your on your feet."
good,"A typical day at Safeway for a courtesy clerk consisted of bagging groceries and maintaining the front end area, while also performing routine safety sweeps of the entire store. I learned how to work at a fast pace and deal with several customers at a time, basically how to be more efficient. The hardest part of the job were the customers, but at the same time they were often the most enjoyable of the aspects because certain interactions were beautiful and even heart-warming."
good,"Worked here for a very short time due to the fact that I injured myself on the job.  The manager didn't really like me and was writing me up every other week for silly things that had nothing to do with my performance as an employee.  When I got hurt using the meat slicer, the manager refused to fill out the worker's comp form honestly and claimed that I was injured at home.  I left the position when I realized that I was never going to move up the ranks or payscale here."
good,"i feel bad for writing this, but honestly, it was frustrating working there.  first, they promise a wages but make you stay 90 days to get them.  days off are  appreciated but you work hard because either people just leave or theres not enough crew to support.  the manager isnt indiffferent, just everyones in the same boat."
good,"This was a fun and fast paced paced job. There were many strong personalities to work with and a fair bit of favoritism. Overall, it was not a bad experience, but I could not handle the physical requirements of the job."
good,"If you are a student, it's a great place to work. Otherwise, I would avoid it at all costs. Management doesn't care about their employees and is unwilling to work with you."
good,"This company was a great place for first experience in the workforce and learning to deal with all sorts of people. Working in the Starbucks kiosk located in side Vons, I was responsible for preparing drinks for customers and making sure they left the store with a positive experience. Management was good, with room for improvement in caring for employers as well as customers. The hardest part was working alone on busy nights trying to manage multiple tasks in an efficient manner. On the other hand, there were fun times doing sales events through announcements and sample tastings  to promote higher sales from the Starbucks department."
good,"I learnt the values of customer service. I loved most of my fellow coworkers, thought the manager was cool until i heard her calling down other employees, the drama between coworkers was ridiculous."
good,Enjoyed working night shift. I was able to get a lot done with very few distractions it was nice to feel like we accomplished a lot every night. It was an enjoyable job.
good,Safeway is good for a first job or a part time job while attending school. Benefits are not available unless working 32+ Hours every week. Management plays favorites and does not work well with problems outside of work.
good,Every day was different because I worked in many different departments. I learned skills in customer service and management. The culture at Safeway was fast paced.
good,The best thing i got from the company was the training . I meet some very good people while i worked there and some people not so much. I did enjoy my time there.
good,I worked at a tough store so im not sure if its the store or the company but I've had stories about people having to go to the union to get the pay that they were supposed to be getting. Lots of customers have stole from the store and the have been stabbing at the store along with a man being passed out in the bathroom from the drugs he's been on. people have showered in the bathroom. almost every night the police had to be called. one time an employee got knocked out back when it was a 24 hour store. but like I said it was a bad store... the only good story I can think of is that for a little bit there we had a really good store manager but before I left they transfered him.
good,"Its a fast paced work environment, Thursday or Fridays are when you get your work schedule for the next week so it is had to make plans. However you will learn multiple skills, learn how to give great customer service. For most people it depends on your coworkers and mangers weather or not you are going to make it or not. The employees are great and have a family feel making it hard to leave the company."
good,All of the people that were the managers were never communicated to eachy other and they never tuly help any one and was almost alwast grumpy or mad abou how people were doing it
good,Every store is operated differently. My first store was great good people very fun to work with like family. Even similar to that family member you have that dosen't like you but you come together when family is in need of help to get the job done when necessary. The 2nd store I was sent too not as welcoming completely different environment than the first scenario. My first week there I was not shown around where I could feel comfortable or shown their procedure. They were mistrusting and rude. My last 2 weeks I worked a total of 8hrs. People that had been there for a long time got the most hours apparently.
good,"training and help is not available"
good,It's a great place to work and you meet a lot of great people but management is not supportive and or help full with anything you need. The employees there are great they are the best part of the job. The company is constantly cutting hours and threats of layoff.
good,"day starts off with making sure floral department is stocked and clean. throughout the day i was making arrangements and doing customer orders. at the end of the day, would stock and clean the department again. I learned how to do arrangements and how to decorate plants. management in the store I worked for was okay most of the time. some of the co-workers were not okay at all. they always kept to themselves and seem to pick on some people. I mostly enjoyed working just in the floral department. I had a lot of fun with some co-workers."
good,I enjoy to work with people daily. I sometimes help people to find the items for the customers. Help the customers to their vehicle. You have to be friendly to the customers daily.
good,"Warehouse money and benefits are at the top of the industryear however it's extremely easy work made stressful by unrealistic expectations and a union so crippled by corruptions, it's ineffective"
good,Wouldn't call it the best place to work but you'll definitely earn your experience in the work force here. Alot of smiling employees. Happy customers.
good,"The overall job was not that bad. I was not a fan of management and they way that the handled certain situations. For example, I was told that in order to get a promotion I had to work night crew but people that started work the same time I did, did not have to do this. I also did not enjoy all the theft that happened and the fact that the company did nothing. It created a feeling of an extremely unsafe work environment which was the reason I left. The customers were also extremely rude but they were seeing all the theft that was happening so I understand why. Overall this was not a great job and I am glad to be no longer employed with this company."
good,"Ok Company to work for.  Some jobs can be hectic, others not so much. The good thing is that you get 8 hours of work and you get paid vacations.  "
good,"I worked here for 8 months. The management were rude, they would trade your days off for employees they liked. The employees would belittle and haze on the newer employees"
good,I enjoy working at Safeway. There is opportunity to increase responsibilities and training.However hours are being cut and i am no longer able to continue working there from a financial point of view.
good,Not good if your going to school they say they will help you but they make you work long hours. On the days I need to go to school they wanted me to work those same hours or they wanted me to come right in after work with out going to group study.
good,"Safeway was a fine job, not something I overly enjoyed but not something I strongly disliked. The hours were not great, but if you work there long enough they get better. Would recommend if looking for part-time work."
good,the company needs a better management in order to create decrease turnover rate for instance. The company treats its employees pretty bad. Employees need to improve their skill and advance their career if it could.
good,"Teamsters Union owns the employer-employee relationship.  The hours are determined by the union rules, the wages are determined by union rules and the ongoing strife between the union and employees was not for me.  The medical benefits are the best I have ever know as an employee.  My children were born while I was employed there."
good,I didn't like working at my particular Safeway . Everything was unorganized. On top of that we had a new manager every month. There was issues with payroll and things of that nature. it was a bad experience for me.
good,"well  very small walk in the freeze . easy bread mix , muffins mix, dounut mix, and brownies mix . I check old date the bread  throw it . fresh daily breads"
good,the company it self use to be great  but very sense the ablertson has taken over the business they expect more then one person can do and they dont give enough hours.
good,"Needs beeter management  and beeter benefits "
good,Safeway is a good place to work if you are just starting out as a teenager or need a summer job or need extra money for college. It is not a good job if you are looking to or are trying to grow or advance in the company as my experience with them has shown.
good,Well it was good at first then upper management messed everything up like they always do. The only thing I miss is how busy I always were when I was working for them.
good,"Safeway is an interesting place to work , because everyday can bring something new and unexpected."
good,"I haven't worked there for quite some time, so management may have changed drastically, but my time there varied in terms of hours. As a full time student doing cashiering along with stocking was very taxing on the mind and body. I would come either at 3:30 p.m. or 5:30 p.m. and work until 12:30 a.m. or 2:30 a.m. I would cashier for 6 hours and stock/cashier the rest of the time. I would the top managers at the store I was working at were not very receptive to other employees. I felt as if they only saw money and not people."
good,"- Hours get cut often ( I once went two weeks without getting even a 4-hour shift)"
good,"I thought I would begin a long tenure when I was hired by Safeway. Within the first week of the job, I was miserable. The PM seemed to be more interested in flirting with the ladies than doing his job, there was a new PIC every night, and the techs gossiped regularly. the patients were downright horrible to us (I know, it's pharmacy, I'm used to it... but I shouldn't have someone threatening me with violence over the wait time on their RX)."
good,"typical grocery store chain, you fill in one of their open positions. Sometimes you get to do something different. I enjoyed working in the deli and restocking the shelves."
good,"Safeway can be considered a little High School. Everyone likes drama and will be in your business. The management was not willing to work with you, unless you were very close with them personally. There are no secrets between you and them. If you request a day off more than likely you didnt get it unless you called in sick. I learned that the one way you can be happy at this place is to keep everything to yourself. Problems show up they shove them under the carpet."
good,little to know breaks. managment didnt help out. and was forced to work and do things not in my job title. while also working 9 to 10 hour days
good,Easy job with great night shift management. The only problem is you get very low hours. No one is full time atm in cashier Work.
good,"On a regular bases there where long lines and not enough people to run a productive deli, when we asked upper management for help they would say they would send someone over and never do. coworkers are nice and fun to work with."
good,"Better management, more appreciation, better benefits, respect others flexibility hours. Other than that they wrrr okay. But it was some what good working there i learned new things . ex: communications, working with others and time management"
good,"The work is about providing product for customers and helping customers when needed to the best of one's ability. I learned how to try and separate the personal from the professional in order to give the best service. The hardest part of the job is to try and balance getting production and cleaning done with helping customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is having an interactive, friendly conversation with customers."
good,pulling out grocery/frozen loads on 6 days a week to stock shelving. Co-workers are decent but high turn over rate. Management difficult to work with due to high standards and keeping staff at a skeleton crew level.
good,"The managers at Chino Valley Safeway are not good people or good managers, but the rest of the employees were awesome. There was always a problem and no one ever stayed employed very long."
good,"Very busy, i learned that don't take customer complaints personally and that management isn't always there to handle things. Don't try to rely on your coworkers to do their job, and the hardest part of the job is the multitasking. The most enjoyable part of the job is going outside to help the customers out with their groceries."
good,I just spent 8 yrs working for Safeway alone. Safeway has recently been bought by Albertsons in May 2016! They came in the building and gave us a pay cut and had us working 16hr shifts 7 days a week! I am a single parent raising a son so I just put my 2 weeks in.
good,The people I worked with were great. I enjoyed the physical aspect of the job and how fast my shifts would go. I liked that I could book days off when I needed to.
good,"Working hard for a few months won't get you a raise, they don't even give out the 10 cent raise after 550 hrs "
good,Being employed in Safeway is a great way to experience in having to learn in a fast pace and also to become flexible with your work schedule due ro the store hours being very busy. Overall working in this company it provides you benefits and a awesome way of interacting with customers and as well as making new friends.
good,"In the last 2 months since June through t least the end of August they have slashed hours significantly. I asked to pick up a shift that someone wanted to drop and because I'm a journeyman and they are basically a new hire I was told ""I'm expensive"" they'd look at it but it did not happen. Schedule changes week to week and almost every single day is different too."
good,"I enjoy interacting with people, but i didn't like the management. There is no benefits and they forget about you. I like keeping busy and i couldn't really do anything except stand there."
good,I like working there the hours are good but there are complications at times with management scheduling. The Safeway is too busy to have the latest courtesy besides the closer leave at like 6:30-7:30
good,I was switched from courtesy clerk to deli after many complaints for back pain from pushing carts. The deli was just as hard and much more work. I eventually was given the opportunity to be opener for the deli starting at 5am and guaranteed full time which would lead to benefits. once I was switched to opener they made sure my hours never exceeded 38hrs per week. I was constantly exhausted and never got a raise or any type of benefits and acknowledgment for my efforts.
good,"While working at Safeway I would typically clean bathrooms, get baskets, do my sweeps, bag groceries. The hardest part about my job was not being able to always make customers happy because we discontinued a product or didn't have it. What i loved most about my job was just helping people and seeing on their faces how much they appreciated it."
good,"Working for this company is an absolute nightmare...impossible to advance unless you are friends with management or lick the right boots. The union is there in name only, you're in constant fear of not knowing if you will have a job the next week or not. The company is very difficult to work with if you have a personal schedule."
good,"With my spring semester at college coming to an end I needed to find a job to work during the summer. I applied at Safeway to work as a Courtesy Clerk since I had experience from a previous job. I went in for an interview, passed my drug test and was hired on. I was offered a position as a Night Clerk instead of working as a Courtesy Clerk. I decided to give it a shot and accepted. "
good,"My experience working at Safeway has helped me improve with my customer service skills, helped me learn and understand from my mistakes and also helped me gain experience for future jobs and opportunities."
good,"If you are part time & in school, you are picked on for being one of the youngest workers. you'll receive back to back tasks with no breaks in between."
good,"An okay job if you're someone looking for quick work. On an average day you do a lot of hard labor. By the time you clock out, you're severely tired."
good,I Was able to use what I learned and advance in new areas. The time I spent there was good and with meeting and working with interesting people i grew as a person.
good,"I have been with Safeway for almost two years.  I brought a bunch of experience with me when I started there, and was told that I would move up quickly.  With as much experience that I brought to the table I expected to be in a better position than I am now.  Safeway has no real plan for me and continues to talk as if they do.  I would like to make the move to a company that can put the skills that I bring to the table to use."
good,"Just as the meaning of the word insanity."
good,it was ok it was the same almost nightly or when I was suppose to work.The boss was easy to get a long with along with my co workers
good,"A typical day at work was extremely boring and exhausting but i always made the best of it and worked as hard as i could to keep the store clean, bag groceries quickly, and provide attentive customer service. I learned to just cooperate no matter what the circumstance and to not affiliate myself with co-workers who try and bring me down. The management was not very professional nor was the store staff in general. I was not trained properly and had to figure out almost everything myself or with the help of friendly co-workers. The hardest part of the job was constantly being on your feet and the most enjoyable part of the job was being around people all day long considering I'm a people person"
good,"Unless you're willing to take poor pay, rude managers, and constantly being moved in district to make you quit. Safeway isn't for you."
good,"Each day was similar, but working as a security officer was more difficult the more time I was employed there. The hourly pay decreased, the work environment was filthy and easily damaged by environmental circumstances, the coworkers were forced to deal with difficult people throughout the shift with little to no motivation or encouragement, and the individuals we were hired to assist would greatly under-appreciate our efforts. "
good,"As first jobs go you can't ask for too much more, being hired was fast as I was hired almost on the spot, the work itself was easy (aside from the occasional pushing carts in the Las Vegas summer.) The store had opportunities for advancement, however those were not available until 18 years of age. However at the time I was being paid under minimum wage."
good,A very serious place where managers were going on a power trip rampage. I loved my fellow co-workers and my deli manager. But my store manager let his title go to his head. A typical work day would result in me making sandwhiches and filling the hot case. The customers were always quite polite and me being the same way went hand-in hand. I developed relationships with many customers as a preferred sand which maker. It is a big company. Quite easy to get to know people. I learned that people will treat you as well or as bad as you treat them. Smiles go a long way. I might seem a little hostile but this is because I was getting paid under minimum wage for a period of three months before I was laid off.
good,"I don't have a lot to say, as I worked seven hours a day after school, meaning I started early and finished late. The job was hard, but I didn't make it out of the probationary period because I was injured, so I don't blame them, only myself. The store manager tried to be understanding but rules were rules. I enjoyed some of my coworkers and was friendly, but the job consumed you."
good,"Will work around a school schedule. Most employees are union employees. Salaried positions are over worked, long days, extremely high standards."
good,"Blind is leading here ,,, no s.O.P or proper training. If that was provided and mentored properly I would be working there."
good,"Flexibility in schedule, awesome and supportive co workers,  Nice addition of skills to include in a resume, the work environment is pleasant' however, can be stressful,"
good,In the beginning it was okay...Management was horrible!!  This company has no integrity they allow employees to steal... and yet they want you to report it...why...nothing is done especially if you are the manager or assistant manager stealing.
good,"This was just a job I took for the summer before I returned to college to finish my degree. I worked the graveyard shift, so that was difficult for me to get on that kind of schedule, especially during the summer when I would rather be outside during the day rather than sleeping. However, the job itself was decent. I enjoyed stocking the shelves and my co-workers were enjoyable to work with. However, when the day shift started and management was there, it put on a whole difference atmosphere that was no longer enjoyable. I did not feel appreciated by management because it seemed to me that they did not think we worked hard and would always give us additional tasks to complete that we would never be able to get done with the amount of work we already had in the hours we worked."
good,"A typical work day involved prepping salads, sandwiches, subs, using industrial ovens to cook turkeys and chickens. use of deep fryers, cutting meats with slicer and tenting to customers. I learned to use the meat slicers and how to weigh meats and salads on a scale in grams and pounds. How to sanitize all cookware, ovens and deep fryers. Can't really say much about management because they hardly came around. My Co-workers were fun and knowledgeable and I appreciate the things they taught me in  so little time. The hardest part of my job at Safeway was cleaning the deep fryer. I enjoyed working their because it was close to home."
good,the shift was very long and it was hard to take breaks. it would eat up your whole day and you would go home exhausted. You have to take a hour lunch and stay the whole shift. you couldnt leave early or come in early.
good,Sometime this can be a very irritating store to work at. But my main focus was just to  come to work everyday and get my work done . The most enjoyable part of the was getting off. I learned to socialized better with people. The management was some what nice.
good,I can work with other nice employs and help good customers that need help I've always wanted to stock shelves for vons and get good advanced postions
good,"A work day would start opening at 5 am, always locked out (never given keys), would bang on door until night crew let me in. Opened alone, a second barista would come in to help, 3-4 hrs into my shift, but usually it was the manager who would spend most, if not all, her time outside of the booth, leaving me little to no relief or help. I worked christmas eve, christmas day, new years eve, and new years day, with the holiday rush, in this position. A customer that christmas emailed the Safeway store manager to commend my good job despite the solitary nature of my work conditions, a compliment for which i was never acknowledged or commended, but heard of second hand. With all this, in my four months there as a barista i was still never fully- trained in doing blended beverages or on how to adequately stock inventory, as many of our products ran out of supply for our manager's lack of new orders. I think the experience would've improved if at a Starbucks chain, rather than a Safeway-run booth."
good,"I started with three managers, all whom changed several times during my time there. Some were very easy going and great to talk to. Others were very rude and seemed to be purposely cruel to courtesy clerks."
good,with the economy the way it is this job is just a job.you are just a number that can be replaced. when i first started it was family but now corporate/Management uses fear to make us work harder
good,"Good company pays good, but hours are too long and company is very under staffed. At the moment there are many changes going on with-in the company and distribution is struggling due to poor planning and employee turnover."
good,Stock shelves clean aisles and bathrooms help customers find groceries. I learned how to make grocery orders. My co workers did not like management most people working there complained. the hardest part of the job was not telling them I quit when I would be in charge of the frozen and Dairy departments at the same time when I was 16 getting paid 7.89 and hour. You needed to be 18 to even work in those departments and I was running them and I was shown no reimbursement.
good,The people at Safeway were a hard working which made everyday a great experience. however a union based workplace makes progression with in the company difficult.
good,The work is tedious and repetitive. The people are fun to be with generally. Most of the employees do not have the spirit of team work.
good,"The only plus to working for Safeway Pharmacy for me was my pay rate, my benefits, and my coworkers. I was hired for phlebotomy and was completely dissapointed when after almost 1 year with the company they canceled the position I was hired for, it was a huge waste of time."
good,Safeway suffers from poor planning and poor execution.  One of the main problems is that this company has been heavy with upper management with no real authority to make a decision.
good,"Although the job was not physically strenuous, you always felt like an expendable asset. Management did not staff appropriately."
good,"I worked for Safeway for 14 years and could not advance past 2nd Assistant for the life of me.  I jumped through every hoop that they presented (rural relocation, across the city, working holidays etc.)  When they were sold to Sobey's they started closing stores which lead to me having to take a step back in the pecking order and take a pay cut.  When they offered their employees that were making more than they were comfortable they offered a buy-out I jumped all over it. I had many instances where a promotion that I deserved was given to a female or visible minority with less experience and effectiveness.  I would not recommend this job to anyone."
good,"The pay is bare minimum, the management somewhat pleasant, the hours are alright, the compensation and benefits are terrible, and there is little to none advancement in this job whatsoever."
good,"Safeway has been an excellent corporation while I've been in college. They have allowed me to transfer when I have moved back home for the summer, and they have worked around my school schedule with little to no difficulty."
good,"in that company, its all about making sales. It actually depends on the managers, but since I've worked there, It has been a nightmare. My manager would literally tell me she don't like me, she would sent me home for little no reasons, she would make you do extra stuff without getting paid that rate, she has preference against others... It was just not going well. If you were to work at Vons, you will see the mistreat and abuse managers give to co workers. Not a pleasant job."
good,"Its a very stressful work environment. There is favoritism among the boss and certain employees. I learned you really cant trust peoples words unless you have it in writing. I got along with almost all my co-workers, the only reason I didn't get along with some was because of how they were talking to me and treating me. The hardest part of the job is cleaning up after people in the restrooms. It will take 35 min for me to clean each bathroom every day. On bad days it would take up to 1hr for each bathroom to be cleaned. The part I enjoyed the most is stocking the candy and cigarettes."
good,"Long days, little recognition. The employees are great to work with. The upper management team is has changed 3 times in 2 years. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with people and customers."
good,"My typical day there was drama drama drama"
good,Not enough hours and they didnt compensate much or let you move up as you should
good,"I worked specifically and only in the Starbucks Coffee Kiosk so I was able to see how the store is run and in the mean time still following the Starbucks standards.  All in all it is a great job, the work was not too hard or too simple and they never asked for too outlandish requests.  A typical day revolves around making sure the kiosk's appearance it beautiful and up to code, greeting customers, making drinks, cleaning, taking out the trash, brewing coffee, mopping, taking phone calls, making phone calls, achieving sales goals, uphold the greatest standards or customer service."
good,"fast paced, work with public, learned patience, great co workers"
good,My day would consists of 2 breaks and one hour lunches. I would assist customers with concerns and also deal with maintenance at the end of my shift.
good,"knowing every part of the store and leaning how to work in each department was awesome. "
good,They train you to use the cash register and on their policies. Co-workers are mostly laid back. There are some cool people that come through that are nice to talk to. Closing is nice and sometimes you restock things. Hardest part of the job is getting yelled at all the time and not being able to say anything. I have gotten death threats before because a woman lost her phone at the store.
good,"My typical day of work would consist of writing daily orders, reading sales reports, ensuring fresh product being maintained,  delegate tasks communicated with sales reps, merchandisers.  Coach and motivated my team promoted team work through out the department."
good,"•	bag customer's orders"
good,"i have no review on safeway , i just started working there in Aug. 18th as a part time"
good,"If you are a college student or a high school student, this would be a great first job. You will have something under your belt when it comes to working. You meet some great people with good stories.The hardest job is maintaining a positive attitude when handling a difficult customer or co worker. I learn what the business world can be like. I always learn something new. Management is ok. I know it can be better."
good,The job was fun decorating no less than 30 cakes a day along with other desserts.orders we priority at least 10 orders a day weekend no less than 25 Management was to young more involved with boy friends than work. The hardest part was arranging freezer to cold to move and having to hear peoples problems or when people don't get along the most enjoyable part was getting to decorate what i wanted and not seeing them when i go to work the next day people liked my work that was rewarding
good,"Safeway as a company has a lot of advancement opportunities, but only if you know the right people."
good,"Fun job nice people      broken shifts w no breaks except lunch often a two to three hour lag between morning and afternoon"
good,"This company had no job security and no communication, I was hired in late may and soon found out that there were no hours. I found this out two weeks after not having any work that there were no hours to be given and that they had no promise of when there would be any at this location. I then went to human resources asking if there was another store that could use the help, unfortunately with the flood there was no work because they needed to accommodate the senior employees first. I never had any communication from my Department manager for several weeks. I contacted my Manager and we decided that it would be best if I were laid off due to lack of hours. Over all I do not believe that this is a good place for anyone out of school to start working due to lack of security, they make promises that there will be plenty of hours and that you will receive at least 15 a week but that is not a for sure thing."
good,"I have been very lucky in my position at Safeway.  I have a great Director who supports and encourages professional development.  The hardest part about my job is the politics and culture.  The most enjoyable part of my job is learning about the industry, other career paths and the experiences I am getting."
good,"Typical day is first doing paperwork, this inculdes reports and payroll to be done everyday. I learned to work quickly and things cannot get completed without teamwork.  Your co-workers are very important.  The hardest part of the job is staffing and the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the company grow and commucating with your customers"
good,"The scheduling was up and down, routine changed daily. Working in the department was good it was always something to do but courtesy clerk was unstable."
good,"A typical day is ringing up customers groceries in a timely and efficient manor while handling any issues that may arise, such as price differences and card issues.   "
good,"Good first job, work around school hours. Union job but can be hard to juggle between home and work."
good,"Safeway was a good company to work for, you where busy all the time and you got to do something every day. I learned so much and the people there where fairly nice. The hardest part is waking up so early in the morning but it's worth it when you go home smelling like fresh made bread. "
good,Great for kids to learn how to interact with the world and to grow tough skin. More for kids now not really for adults that need a steady income and set hours that have a family.
good,"Horrible management and power abuse in warehouse, unsafe conditions and un fair work practices. was fired for personal injury even though doctors notes and documentation for fmla was provided."
good,Not somewhere i would work again. always had to pick up slack from other workers and it never got noticed
good,Most of the people I worked with were fun however my hours were all over the place and they don't allow people to take certain days off
good,it was a constant work enviornment
good,This job was able to provide flexible hours that helped while I was in school. I did not perceive this job as a long time career .
good,A typical work day at Safeway was to punch the time you came in and start working. I would be working in one to three different departments within the store. I might start in the produce and then I would go to the front to work as a cashier to help out the front end taking away my time from the produce department. I would also stock shelves when I am in the meat department. I would barely get everything done for the day. I would stay to finish cleaning produce department. I would still be paid front end clerk salery when I moved up to produce and meat clerk.
good,"bagged groceries,stocked shelves in the store did inventory.and shipping an reciveing.learned to be good with the public and great team work.hardest part of the job was stocking shelves during busy holidays,most enjoyable part was getting results for the work u learned and working well with other employees."
good,"Its a fast pace enviorment, its a fun place to work, the people are great"
good,My engineering manager and another co workers in engineering department were all cousins. They give me real hard time.
good,Its a lot to do for such little pay. the only good thing is you get paid every thursday.
good,"I had a great experience at safeway, all employees were easy to get along with and work with, i would work there again just at a different location. Cause personally the manager of the store terminated me for no reason at all. My papers for the union were lost in the mail so he asked me to take care of it and by the next day i did. I told that i got it taken care of and asked when i could come back to work. He said we dont need you anymore. And for 6 months i asked for my termination papers that i still have not recieved from him. Hardest part of the job was to try and help every customer with their needs and keep them happy, it was fun though. the most enjoyable was meeting new people that were customers and helping them with anything they needed."
good,"Hard working, Friendly with others, like to play online with my friends"
good,"The first 4 years were very good with Safeway and then the company started screwing around with everything, we bought out another pharmacy and it was a non-stop from opening til closing. Had no time to do anything and get caught up...always behind on counting and labeling the prescriptions, was a nightmare when they cut the extra help back. Coworkers were fine, store manager was fine but the department manager...not so fine, I was really disappointed in him when I left. Dirty deeds done dirt cheap. Karma bus will pick him up soon."
good,I learned to work with food and food safety regulations as well as multitask in a very fast pace working environment. The hardest part of the job would be lack of team work and the most enjoyable part of the job is tasting new products.
good,I have to say they do good at constantly keeping everything clean and have a good variety of people working there. But they are hard to get good hours with.
good,"my review is that it was a good job at first. Then there was unrealistic production time. I was proud to work at safe way until management kept disappearing. there was no one around to ask Questions and the store kept changing. Costumer service was bad and the store was not clean or full.people were not happy to be working there but happy to be working.i jumped hurtles by doing the work myself. id make a lists, who followed was great, who didn't, there was no manager around to confirm or discipline."
good,They don't know how to work around school schedule or life issues
good,"Honestly, a cashier's job USED to be a good job... not so much anymore. I worked at Safeway for two years as a cashier and never made more than $9 an hour. Safeway is a union job and so monthly union dues are a big chunk to have to pay when you're barely making above minimum wage. I met a lot of nice people though; but overall this job is totally unrewarding."
good,"I don't know where you'll be working, but I used to work in a grocery store as a Courtesy Clerk. It was just a fancy name for ""bagger."" You know, the person that says ""paper or plastic,"" bags the groceries and helps people out to their cars. I also did things that nobody else wanted to do, like clean the bathrooms, run and get groceries for customers who were already at the checkout line, take things back to the shelves, bringing in carts, etc. So, it will probably just be a lot of customer service and doing things for other employees that are ""higher up"" than you. At least that's what it was for me."
good,"Worked hard alone everyday without any real support from my bosses and was expected to do managerial duties without proper compensation. The management cared, but not enough to change any policies, since it was all set by corporate."
good,While working at Safeway I was not too happy but I did have consistent hours. The schedule was not that flexible witch is makes it hard to valence work and school for a long time
good,Employees were constantly dealing with reduced hours and unpredictable schedules from store management. Unrealistic expectations were set and limited resources were allocated poorly.
good,"The company ""Safeway"" is a good company to work for if you don't plan to be their for a time because they go through so many employees and only have a short amount of hours they can give each what often happens is they hire a new person and take your hours away and give them to a new person even though you have been their longer"
good,"Great people, hard to move up and not too many options for more pay. .Com is definitely one of the more stressful departments, especially if you're running shifts and not getting compensated well for it."
good,The company only really cares about the amount of revenue they can bring in. They set unrealistic expectations of how you’re supposed to act while working regardless of how you’re treated. The work load isn’t even worth the minimum wage that they offer you and you can only   access your “benefits” after about five years so they don’t really help. Overall the work environment is not really the best.
good,Good job but don't pay what your worth no pay raises only steps no matter how hard you work have worked for 4 years and make $2 more than minimum wage
good,"Opportunity to advance in career.  Low level work with low pay due to union contract is the norm but exceptional workers can be moved into management quickly.  Top end of union contract pays in the low end of retail workers. Runs a tight labor model to maintain profits, sometime unrealistically but mostly fair.  Corporate model is very strict.  Local management is firm but fair and encourages putting in the time to move up."
good,Busy workplace with great customers and co-workers.  Upper Management expectations and appreciation lacking.  Disappointed in mandatory hour reductions mandated despite the consistent volume of prescriptions dispersed and increase of daily duties.  Monetary raises are few and far between.
good,It was a decent place of work the people could have been a little bit kinder but besides that it is a great place to work. Especially If you are looking for a entry level job to start out or even retire.
good,I enjoy all my customers. Safeway should be more involved with relationships with employees at least recognizing some work ethics. Overall I have found a home there even though they don't offer full time which I totally disagree with.
good,"Safeway used to be a good company to work for, but now it isn't, Walmart and other supermarkets are taking over their business Safeway is not like it used to be"
good,"this was my first job and it wasn't great but wasn't terrible. Usually closed alone so I didnt have to deal with annoying coworkers, customers were okay, tasks were pretty straight forward and you dont really do anything outside of your job."
good,The main issue with Safeway is that they have no competitive wages and you wont receive a pay raise until you've worked for approximately two years and there aren't many advancement opportunities.
good,Wasn’t that nice overall. There wasn’t respect  towards each department equally nor pay. You work too hard and get paid the least it just wasn’t what was fair or right.
good,Was a great place to work. lots of diversity. As always some good aspects and a few let downs. The young Management seem a little entitled . Not enough encouragement for new staff.
good,"I used to love working there, but now I hate it. I would have close to 40 hours weekly continued to go down more and more. Only offered about 14 hours at $12 an hour doesnt pay anything."
good,No teamwork no management no consistency no accountability it’s a great job if you are coasting through life no job advancement unless you are favored unbelievable
good,"I was a barista at a Starbucks kiosk within Safeway, but I was technically a Safeway employee.  Fun environment where associates felt like a little family, and hours were very flexible for each department as long as you were under full time.  The pay and benefits were bare minimum however - ""competitive pay"" is translated to mean as little as they can legally get away with giving you."
good,Overall working at Safeway has been great. The people are amazing and it’s very clean work space. However I find myself feeling like I do more work that what I get paid for. They will take as much as you’re willing to give them.
good,"If it was a slow day I learned to remain occupied. If it was a busy day it wasn't fair to be understaffed and difficulty learning computer system. Enjoyed learning how to make balloon bouquets, floral arrangements and also sometimes to my own liking."
good,Management is not good at all. Quantity  is looked at over quality. Hours are inconsistent and pay increases are based on hours worked. A lot of harassment is overlooked or not taken seriously.
good,"Pharmacy was okay, the atmosphere was sufficient. There was no program training, making it difficult to guess at the computer. Most of the workers with the exception of two were not helpful on passing on what they knew and maintained negative attitudes to anyone new."
good,"I worked for 11 yrs. in the bakery department. And I learned a lot of different tasks. I would still be there, but the store closed to become a Freshco."
good,"I was no impressed with the management team. But, Safeway as a company has plenty of of opportunities to move and cross train between departments to expand your skill set."
good,Being a checker at Safeway taught me a great many things to advance my already seasoned customer service background. I really like the people I work with.
good,"the only thing I can say that makes working here worth it is needing money, find another job if possible, the schedule is horrible, no benefits or vacation, takes forever to get a 10 cent raise (1000 hours)"
good,Been working for the company for 26 years.  Currently the company is heading in a direction that the future and security that was once there is no longer.
good,Safeway was a good job for the time being. But I was there for over a year and I’m only 17 so it was just time for something new. The employees there were all very friendly and helpful. There was always something to do so I could keep myself busy. Overall it was a good job.
good,"The good part about Safeway was getting a decent amount of hours, but it only came with hard work and showing the managers that I was capable."
good,"Job can be very face paced. Always found myself busy. If I wasn't answering calls or taking orders I would be restocking, cooking, cleaning, organizing, getting shipments, and packaging food items. Can be a bit stressful at times but overall was not a bad work experience."
good,Not a place for someone who does not want to work hard.   Depending on location you will work with some great managers. You must be available to work any day of the week and any hours.
good,"I worked as a courtesy clerk and Starbucks barista and honestly didn’t mind my job while I had it. Just show up on time, do what needs to be done right and management will appreciate it. I wish it didn’t take so long to be apart of their union but when your part time that’s how it is. It was easy to juggle life and work due to being part time. Based on your position you are  guaranteed a certain amount of hours per week. You can also ask for more or stay longer if they needed help too."
good,The job was very hard working. A lot of lifting and stocking to perfection.  Thats when i realized i wanted to go back to veterinary medicine were I am meant to be.
good,It's okay but unfortunately was one of those jobs where you work harder you getting the recognition if you slack off they praise you I busted but working many departments 12 bucks an hour
good,Working for Safeway was my first job. Love/ hate relationship. I was work-hungry and worked my butt off for them. Management seemed to lack respect for their employees and the days seemed long and stressful.
good,"Generally a calm environment, but some of the manger-types make the job stressful, unwilling to flex on hours and ignoring schedule restrictions. Though most co-workers are very nice."
good,"When I was hired at Safeway, It was to take hours away from employees in need of benefits. High school and college kids were brought in to pick up the extra hours, increasing the all-over turnover rate. It left long-term employees at a loss and put a lot of responsibility and stress onto those trying to make a living. The management was overworked, my manager was constantly tired from managing a large group of people day-in and day-out. Really broke my heart."
good,Starting out it was a great place to work. However as my duties grew the support to get them done would drop. Other associates would leave messes over night to be cleaned up by night shift or early morning employees with no consequence. Unfinished duties would be left until the next day at expense to customer experience.
good,"When I started, prior to acquisition by Albertsons Inc parent company in 2014, Safeway was a great place to work with positive emphasis on customer service and improving customer and employee satisfaction. Work requirements were reasonable and the tools and resources available to employees for proper job performance were more than adequate. However, after the completion of the merger and integration of Albertsons Inc systems with existing Safeway infrastructure, there was a slow, but steady degradation of the support environment. Systems were modified (often reducing capacity or availability of tools for front line employees) or replaced entirely with systems that were poorly conceived and implemented. Upper management approved a series of changes to customer websites and apps which radically changed how the customers interacted with the sites (while never advising the customer that changes were coming, or providing information about the changes when they were put in place). Many of the changes were made with little (or in some cases no) information provided to Customer Support, so the customer's experience when they would call for assistance was often less than satisfactory, which increased employee stresses. During my last year, the emphasis for Customer Support changed from resolving the various customer issues on the first contact, to handling an increasing number of mandatory contacts each day. At the same time, procedures were changed to limit the actual amount of assistance Customer Support (in the Ecommerce section) could actually provide on many issues. Employee morale"
good,"My experience has been mixed. Its a few blocks from my home so commute is a non issue. I cannot speak for the main store and how staff are treated, but for fuel stations it feels as though you are not an actual employee, the area I work at has an upsurge in violent crime and no security checkups are even a priority. Any issues concerning numbers or supplies are limited and at the convience of the people working inside. Management only comes out to issue write ups or a half hearted update. "
good,All decision making was taken out of the hands of store management. Corporate managers were making all business decisions for each store. This lead to lots of frustrations.
good,If you young and looking for work experience and don’t need to support yourself it’s a good start or if you need a flexible schedule to supplement income from a different job however to management your are little more than a number on a spreadsheet they can replace you easily and won’t hesitate to do so there is little to no room for advancement so as soon as you get an opportunity leave for something better.
good,Love my job. And thw people i work with as well. The break room is spacious and some of the employees are friendly. They ended up cross training me to work in different departments which gave me more hours.
good,They never work with you with scheduling .Unattainable goals.Never enough help.No communication.They do not teach you how to achieve their goals.Happy I left.
good,"I enjoy shopping at Safeway, but hated working there. When I worked for Safeway they were in the process of being bought out and everything was changing. Management was very touchy. I worked at a high demand location, so we were always busy which was nice. If I hadnt had the department manager that I had I probably would have stayed longer, but that person made it hard to work there, especially for her. I needed a change and left. Even though I had a poor experience doesnt mean I would want to ruin it for others. Not all locations are the same and they are under new management and a new corporation as well. Hopefully everything chamged for the better."
good,i did learn good customer service skills. very fast paced and physical learning experience. hours were not as flexible as they could be. Some of the tasks were very hard to accomplish without help from others. Accommodations in this type of work would have been a little bit helpful.
good,"I worked in the bakery, so a typical day would start at 4:30 in the morning. I learned that the staff at Safeway are welcoming to newcomers. I had a decent manager, I really don't have much to say on that. The culture was a melting pot, I've learned many customs."
good,"While this might not reflect everyone's experience, I can say working in the deli was not very fulfilling. I started in the night shift, and one issue I ran into early on was a lack of communication between the morning and night crew. The other common issue was turnover, which at one point we were working with half a night crew. At the same time, we were also constantly told ""no overtime."" "
good,"I did not like the low pay I received while working here as a Deli clerk."
good,"Hired part time, so they wouldn't have to provide health benefits. But work you 40+ hrs. Lots of work with little or no help. Union is a joke, but they make sure their money is takin out of your check each week"
good,Safeway was very fast paced with lots to do every day. The staff are very nice and enjoy working by your side. Work load can be difficult due to the cut of budget
good,Very less stressful place to work but you will most likely pull your hair out with the way management can be when it comes to paying there employees correctly
good,"the management and job its self were ok. I was very basic work that didn't really produce much of a challenge. I really didn't like the management set up, because the managers were always in a room by themselves and anytime I had to go talk to them I felt like I was going to the principles office at school."
good,"I can only speak for the operations of the Deli.   One of the biggest  problem areas is in the sub-contracted section of the deli, whose employees bare no responsibilities for the deli  To the average customers, they look like they're standing around and ignoring them. "
good,I started with this company when I was very young. I was still completing my high school diploma and wanted to have some hands on experience with working outside. Overall it was a pleasure to work there.
good,"Typical day would be alright. For first job I did learn a lot of new things. Management is okay in some departments but some have some problems. Workplace is good, most of people are friendly and helpful."
good,It was a OK place to work.  I work in the deli and we had are busy day and we also had  are slow  day.   I cook  the fried chicken  and i had make sure the hot case filled.  I think  the hardest part  of my job. Was having to change the oil in the fryers.  I felt like they made me do everything while other deli Assocate didn't   have to do everything.
good,Good coworkers and management takes a long time to get medical benefits over a year and almost 2 yrs for spouse's and children and over 2 yrs for dental
good,"The management at safeway was very poor. She would rarely speak to me, and there was no way she would get me a manager position. I never was offered a pay raise. she also cut my hours and the reason was that she over hired and that she had to cut everyones hours."
good,"A typical day at Safeway is serving customers, stocking shelves and doing other menial tasks. I gained a lot of customer service skills while working there but very little else. The workplace lacks culture, it is a rather boring atmosphere. Management is very accommodating, and overall nice. However, they make your life very difficult when you try to call in sick, keyword being try because they try their hardest to guilt you to come in even if you give the proper amount of warning. "
good,"Was fired because I could not pay the union dues when I was barely getting by as a college student as it was. However, the produce manager was very nice and understanding with my school schedule/."
good,"well wed show up clock in at the morning meeting and stretch to not get cramps and people would be drinking preworkout and just getting ready go grab our jacks and go to the printer where the head set that we had to wear would tell us what job we had to do. Then we would go to either produce, dairy, cheese or meat room and fill the order."
good,I worked the late afternoon to closing shift mostly was up at the register ringing customers purchases. finish putting freight away. When it slowed down to complete in bound.
good,"never know when you might be off, cannot plan anything to include doctor appointments, nothing set in stone. no hours, cannot live off 25 hours a week, corporate pushing items on the store that it has not room for to store. so much back stock that the over head is out of control. "
good,After all the years I put into Safeway I just felt unappreciated I was treated unfairly I did my best at this job put in a lot of effort respected my job and liked what I did I just fill like I'm ready to move on and try something new
good,"There a lot of positive people at this company ,but they are a few that make it impossible for you to grow and value you only if you are a brown nose I'm not a brown nose I speak the truth and some people can handle the truth I do miss working with that company but dont miss the store managers always belittle the employees and not showing a  lead by example."
good,"The environment was good but the scheduling was bad and management was slightly lacking, Booking time off was difficult and management did not have a contact unless they where at work"
good,"...but it wasn't the best. It was a good place to start learning how to do work, but one can quickly see what management is like - or supposed to be like. I learned customer service well, though."
good,"Safeway is not a horrible place to work by any means but it also does not provide much room for growth. In my experience, Safeway has done the bare minimum with training, benefits to employees, and compensation."
good,"I wouldn't recommend working at specific Safeway on Norbeck Rd, Rockville, MD. The managers have bad attitude and are bias. Its a very funny unprofessional work environment. Only good part is weekly pay."
good,There is no such thing as a typical work day being that you are working retail with the general public. Very fast paced and must be someone who is high energy. If you are a quiet or slow moving person this may not be the employer for you. Work place culture is set on great values but also has a high school click style vibe. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was working with our older customers who genuinely appreciated great customer service.
good,"Typical corporation that is about making money rather than providing an environment that is good to be a human in. Hardest part of the job, going there, to be around angry people, its a culture of 'find someone else to do the tasks that you don't want to complete yourself.'"
good,"good for teens who are looking for a safe place to begin work. Very predictable- no curveballs will be thrown around."
good,"Back in the earlier days, health insurance was given after 6 months on the job. In 2012-2013, that changed to working a whole year and only benefits for you and your children, not your spouse. Once you learn the produce codes as a cashier, it makes your job easy to do."
good,Great people worked there and had an amazing culture. Many people come from different backgrounds and was able to relate with many workers. Training and assignments were challenging.
good,"I understand that it's a retail job, but customers in grocery stores seemed to be the worst. Getting yelled at by customers because ""The customer is always right"" (which is not true at all) and them thinking you have direct control over everything going on the store. Recent management, seemed to not care about the workers and would insult us in front of customers or would ignore our requests. Not only store management, but company management would always expect too much work to get done with little time and help."
good,"It was fast paced, and competitive but it was also met with a lot of laziness and poor management. Not a lot of opportunities to grow as an employee, and too many expectations to work under different titles with little change in pay."
good,"Safeway was not an enjoyable company to work for. I was trained for many areas and performed in all of them without ever getting a pay raise and though they could have had me full time they would intentionally schedule me for less than full time so that I could not receive full time benefits. It is very difficult to get a raise--it is a company that makes it feel like hard work does not pay off.  In order to be ""promoted"" to cashier I had to pay a massive fee that was the same amount as my weekly pay--and it did not result in a raise."
good,"this job has a flexible schedule, worked around my school hours. But they only promote people they like, it has to do more with your chemistry with  management and less with work ethic"
good,"My time at Safeway as been nothing but good. The coworkers are hardworking and outgoing. Everyone tries to keep an uplifted spirit when at work , even if we may not want to be there ,or there’s been a situation in which it would disrupt the positive energy going around."
good,"The best part about being a personal shopper is filling the early mornings with something to do.  I personally like how the position is all customer based meaning depending on how many customers place their orders for that day. As shoppers, our hourly pay is based on how fast and accurate we can fill the orders."
good,Work is assigned daily depending on projects and required daily shipping.  Employees work as a team to get shipments out daily.  Work is done mostly standing all day.
good,"Lots of hours and very fast paced. Its hard for management to take a break without being interrupted. Always on call, it seemed like you worked 24/7. Not cool."
good,It would be a regular work day. I learned how to use certain chemicals with certain things. I learned how to manage my time better while working. The hardest part about the jobs was getting a break.
good,"The work itself was not hard to do. The worst part was dealing with customers. Overall, it was my coworkers that made the job bearable. I was able to get in the prep room so I did not have to deal with angry customers as often"
good,"A typical day at work for me included proper customer service and a providing customers with properly made drinks. I learned that you have to have patients, kindness even when others aren't kind to you, and you can help someone else day. The management is great, just feel that it is hard to communicate. The hardest part of the job when you organize something and keeping it that way, because you do get busy. It is also hard to make a living because the amount of hours you are limited too. My employees are magnificent and I really do enjoy working with them, everyone wants to succeed and everyone is really caring."
good,"start work at 615am, get off at 4pm."
good,"I worked here for almost two years. When I was going to college in the fall, they reduced my hours to 10 a week, and did not tell me I could transfer. The one time I needed money, and they cut my hours for the whole summer. The management did not care about you, unless they had a problem that they knew you could fix. But that was just at my store."
good,"I think Safeway is a good company but the management wasn't great. Also as the only female of my position, I felt like I was taken advantage of because my male coworkers didn't care about work and placed a lot of the work on me (maybe it was just a personality thing idk). But it was good pay and weekly, which I liked."
good,"Responsibilities included checking out prescriptions, answering telephone inquiries, and pharmacist referrals. Focused on the customer service and prescription ordering process, as well as problem resolution and inventory management."
good,"The job was pretty relaxed most of the time; although the management and co-workers pushed me to work harder and faster even though I was meeting all the deadlines."
good,"in a typical work day I am  usually working independently  serving customers.I find a lack of training, as things change very often there needed to be a lot more communication between the manager and employees, I learned   to work alone most of the time, and  the hardest part of the job was me being the one stuck with some of the hardest tasks week after week, and others not having to do as much in the kiosk. i did like my customers, and enjoyed working with some of the younger coworkers"
good,"Although Safeway has competitive pay and some advancement opportunities, i would not recommend it to someone who is looking for a long term and stable job."
good,A typical work day at Safeway can be stressful at times depending on the day or month. It’s great talking to everyday nice costumers and giving them good costumers service. Must have high patience and great costumers services to work at Safeway in any position. Management has grown from when first starting in 2014 but could still be improved on greatly. Favoritism can happen discreetly. Hours are often low. Doesn’t provide full time in most cases. Hours are sporadic.
good,Safeway is a fine place to work as long as you have a good boss mine hired more people then needed and then cut hours. Fellow employees are fun but nobody really cares abut there job.
good,"I applied as a barista with the schedule of a barista. First, they decided to cross train me. No problem. Then they kept using me as a clerk instead of a barista and added later and later shifts outside my availability. Finally, I would work five days a week and only part of one shift on one day would be as a barista. Not ok."
good,"In the beginning, working at Safeway was a wonderful experience, but as the management positions changed and new people came in, it soon became corrupt. The original management group I had been employed under were very compassionate to those who were starting their first job. I have many good things to say about these people. But as management changed, the new people were far less than compassionate and borderline abusive to the customers and staff. Most people were working 6-8+ hours a day balancing school and work, on top of this there was extremely limited break time and many of the employees were denied enough time to eat, take a break, or relieve themselves. The management group also played victim when an employee had to call out for being sick, often forcing sick employees come into contact with food and many customers during their long shift. "
good,"Working for Safeway has been an eye opening experience, it has taught me the necessary skills to drive me towards setting and achieving higher employment goals for myself. Though it has also held me back from the desire to achieve said goals within their company."
good,"You have to love what you do, other wise if you work like others you may feel not worthy at your job. Sometimes employers  favor others with no work ethics than the guy who hauling at a fast pace, another words stick to yourself don't worry about other people."
good,Once you're hired they think your life is safeway and safeway only. The customers and employees in other departments make the stress all worth while the managers are rude and expect you to do everything in and out of your job description without explanation.
good,Hour where never consistent never got enough hours. The management would never work with you in a emergency situation. Enjoyed employees. Was not far from my house.
good,"I was in the job for some money so I could afford living while at college. I never got the raise I was promised every 6 months, and the union did nothing for me but was required anyway, so I was losing the 35 dollars to be a part of it every month anyway. The hours were changed every week, and they were good about working around my college schedule, but the other employees called in so much you often ended with more hours than scheduled. They did pay overtime, but I got in trouble for staying after a couple of hours because of how busy it was, because they couldn't afford to give me the overtime pay."
good,"Safeway was a great company to work for. The employees were like family mostly. Management was hit or miss most of the time. Corporate level management is where a lot of the problem is. They expect a lot of you, especially and can be overly rude and over critical. With the help that you're provided, you do the best you can. You never get praise for the work you do, only berated(verbally) for the things wrong, and yet they never lift a finger to help. They also throw twice the work on the ""old timers"" because the ""millennials"" don't want to work or think they shouldn't work that hard. A lot of the problems started to get worse after a couple years after Albertsons started running the company."
good,"Working at Starbucks in Safeway allowed me to connect with customers at more of a personal level. It's a great 1st job to gain experience. But I had very poor management where I wasn't able to work on my school stuff. Instead I've been working full time everyday as an opener. It's a really fun job for younger people to enjoy. Being a barista isn't an easy job, it takes time to learn how to make every single drink at Starbucks and plus everyone is different.There's just a lot you have to cope with as a barista, such as memorizing regulars drinks (in which it took me a month to remember) but overall working at Starbucks at Safeway isn't a terrible job it's just a great start off of what customer service is really like and demonstrates how to deal with people everyday."
good,"I was a cashier and in floral which got hectic at times but it was mainly ok. It's a lot like high school though, everyone has a cliqu. wasnt too happy about all the gossip either."
good,n/a It is better to say nothing at all than to speak ill of an employer. Instead i will have to fill this space with unnecessary typing in order to meet the minimum charater limit.
good,"Worked for vons 25 yrs on night crew, had an injury when i returned got screwed out of my full time and they made me an part time checker....no loyalty"
good,"Very simple, just have to follow what the manager demands you to do. I was a courtesy clerk which was the only department 16 and 17 year olds can work in, so I got to deal with carts, bagging groceries, and cleaning."
good,I worked in the Deli at Safeway. I learned a lot about deli products and about giving great customer service. I didn't like that I was there for 2 years and I could not advance to a higher paying job
good,"Would be a better place if the management was not all women, they allowed personal life and emotions into work place I find Very Unprofessional might work for a different Safeway if the Managment was diverse."
good,"It's an okay job to start but don't expect very much. For a start, its okay and there are a few opportunities for advancement(at least where I was) but it is not something you want to stay at for the long term. there is not much else to say its an average work environment."
good,there is new management then when i worked there so the quality has improved alot the old managers were rude and boderline hatefull. new management ive heard is understanding
good,It was OK depending what ur position was but as a courtesy clerk I had a lot of freedom I would say and management wasn't to bad ..the hrs would b my only complaint if because they would give a lot of them to special needs employees..
good,Good place to work and easy job - if you get the hours. Management can be hit or miss. Generally accepting but its like pulling teeth trying to request something.
good,"i love the people i work with & the managers are great. But, in my opinion, the deli is the worst department to be in. They get the rudest customers & i absolutely hate coming home everyday smelling the chicken grease."
good,"Worked in the Deli section, which was good.  I learned to use different types of machinery which helped me later on for other deli's.  Part time job.  Didn't have benefits because I was a part time employee. "
good,"The job itself is fairly easy, it was the people who you worked around that could make the job difficult. everyone hated it there and most feel that the management is poor due to unfairness and scheduling issues."
good,"I loved working in the cut fresh department of Safeway, although the manager was not pleasant to work under. I am still employed there but I am looking to obtain a career and not just a job. Safeway does not appreciate hard working people. Instead when they see your a hard worker they place to  much upon you and let the slackers just cruise by without any expectations. It is not a good balance, I feel if you treat your employees good they in return treat the customers good and business benefits from that."
good,Worked in the seafood department and as a cashier. It was inconsistent hours and was physically demanding. Understaffed and stressful. Typical retail experience.
good,"Management isn't the best and retail/customer service is hard. Overall goodjob, and many opportunities, Must be willing to ask for different positions."
good,"I originally left for the difficulties with the scheduling, but overall it was an okay job. A typical day as a courtesy clerk involved bagging groceries, getting carts, sweeping, and cleaning the bathroom. It was a pretty decent workplace culture."
good,"Customer service, making sure the customer is happy and satisfied with their trip. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new customers and creating friendships with them."
good,"I learned a lot about working in a fast pace environment here. It was always an interesting experience. However, as a cashier, I did not have a clear-cut manager so this was more of a group effort. Additionally, I was only supposed to be working part time but averaged out at full time hours by the time I quit."
good,Don't get me wrong safeway is a good company to work for. But they should listen to there employees more. That way they would have better under standing what goes with there customers on these home deliveries.
good,I really enjoyed working there one of my  favorite jobs maybe it was the market but I loved everything about the market that I was working at good luck to anyone that works there
good,"customers blames the front for the problems from the back "
good,Overall I have enjoyed my time with Safeway however the treatment of employees and management is concerning. There is little to no room for career advancement in certain fields. Management communication is lacking. Expectations are unrealistic.
good,as a barista you get called in to work very often due to short staff or sick calls at least once to three times every two weeks which means more hours but for little pay the most enjoyable part of the job is the kind hearted customers but the scheduling needs work
good,"Load groceries deliver return unload totes. To work with others at the store or on the road. Didn't know manager well had 4 in the 5 years I was there. The work place great people I worked with at the store, at the dock, in dotcom area. No hard parts about the job. the most enjoyable were the guys / Drivers I worked with. Was hard to be there 4.5 years and new people come in starting pay the same as yours they should have fixed the pay with time served"
good,"There's a lot benefits, good hours, but management is difficult to communicate with and get a Long with. Overall,  if you can handle bosses then you'll mostly likely stick with it."
good,"A job that offered benifits, biweekly pay. Great people and advancement opportunities. Not much diversity in this region as far as management or hourly positions."
good,"Typical day was taking care of customers, collecting carts, cleaning of restrooms/deli counter/meet counter/bakery.  I learned working along side others is a privilege. Management could be better. The workplace culture, I made some friends there. The hardest part of my job was collection of carts.  The most enjoyable part of my job was taking trash to the dumpster."
good,"Overall it's mediocre, the negatives balanced out any positives so it just comes to a middle ground of ""not horrible, not great"". What really bothered me about working here though was that it wasn't a cooperative community, if anything it was the opposite. Departments seemed like they would just pawn off their problems on to the others and as the night crew a lot of that laziness would pile on to us. Management was unresponsive at best and excessively nitpicky at worst. Day off requests were generally honored however after a point they no longer honored my request to have a specific day off of the regular schedule. Co-workers were a bit hit-or-miss some where really good but others would backbite and gossip. Now for the customer service, the benefits of overnight work was that there was less customer service but make no mistake there will still be a lot both direct and indirect. After closing you'll likely have people trying to be cheeky and get their shopping done while the store is closed and give you the stink eye or berate you if you tell them that the store is closed. Indirectly you'll have to clean up the messes people would leave on shelves or relocate items to their proper places. Overall I don't feel like my time working here was wasted (resume fluff, payment, etc) but I would say my time there caused me to become fairly jaded. If you get a chance for something better I would implore you to take it but if you have no better job prospects this should be sufficient."
good,"This was my first job. Got hired as Courtesy worked it for about a week or two then promoted to be a cashier. then promoted to be a night crew lead. "
good,"job was very stressful, but the pay was ok fast pace, if you are ok with working more than 12 hours a day the job is great for you. but the managerment was not go, bad communication to there workers."
good,"i felt so stressed after beening at this company my 1 st year after finding out that they hired me at a topped out rate and was never told. then to be expected to do the mass amount of work by myself so to much for them to ask for but i hung in there for over 2 more years of being tooken advantage of..then when i got a second job for the holidays,it was a huge problem for them."
good,Safeway was a great company 23 years ago they paid well and they took care of their employees ! Slowly over the years they started trying to fire everyone that was full-time ! I did learn a lot at Safeway about the meat department ! However the management was always horrible !! A typical day at work would be complete harassment ! The hardest part of the job was dealing with management the best part of the job was dealing with my customers !! Work culture was horrible everyone was very miserable !
good,You migh as well open your own pharmacy .Pharmacy ops basically try to make every possible effort to make the pharmacy staff accountable for every thing which is legally possible with bare minimum back stage support .
good,"Very busy store but enjoyed meeting new people"
good,At my particular store a typical day would be climbing a mountain. Lot of call ins and lack of caring. Seemed everyday was a battle to get to an operational stance. Just to come back in and do it all again the next day. Management was lackadaisical and never took disciplinary action to the ones who deserved it. The most enjoyable part was the customers. Always enjoyed helping them any way I could.
good,"At the time I worked for Safeway/Starbucks we were the only coffee shop in a high traffic area, which led to us being extremely popular. This was the first Starbucks I worked at and I had a few very good mentors to train me about the Starbucks culture. While the department management was excellent, the management of the store itself was not always as encouraging and friendly. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the yield of business we had while maintaining a clean and organized department. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friends I made while working there."
good,"Management is unwilling to collaborate with employees around scheduling, would be scheduled overnight then work a morning shift the next day, night the day after that. Would reject requested time off for Sundays, wouldnt inform when i had requested Friday and Saturday off, then threatened to be written up for missing work on Sunday."
good,"It was one of the locations considered as one of the worst in the city. "
good,"A typical day would be clocking in, then going to check what your doing at what times of the day as in when you will be doing carts or when you will be inside bagging, helping customers, etc. "
good,Was a good place to work did many years for safeway left tree time and taken back three times as i was good at my job was transferred three times
good,"Can be great when you work with the right team, but every store manager I have worked under has been dismissive and doesn't seem to understand what its actually like for their front end teams. Job hours rarely consistant, company always looking to cut corners. Always hiring, though. Decent starting job."
good,"A typical day working at Safeway includes operating a cash register, keeping my check stand clean and presentable, assisting customers  with their needs around the store, and keeping the parking lot free of carts. I learned a lot while working at Safeway. I was trained in every single department.. Front End, Bakery, Dairy, Floral, Deli, ect. The hardest part of working at Safeway is rounding up the carts outside at the end of your shift. The most enjoyable part of working at Safeway is creating relationships with the customers, ultimately creating customer loyalty."
good,"This is a fairly easy job if you're an experienced delivery driver. The trucks are easy to drive and most deliveries are quick and painless. On the other hand Downtown Portland is always a challenge. Parking is always risky and tickets can happen quick. Loading can be an issue as each store has a slightly different setup in back. The schedule is the biggest problem; the shifts are setup somewhat strange and make having a personal life a very difficult thing to achieve. If you're part-time, you'll probably be working 15-25 hours, 5 days a week. If you're full-time, you'll probably be working 35-40 hours, 5+ days a week with double shifts on certain days. There is no room for advancement and no where to go but possibly from part-time to full-time. Pay increases are based on a meager percent system so you'll most likely see raises in the pennies and nickels."
good,High risk in traffic and work load sometimes is over limit with many heavy items to cary.  Meeting the time periods sometimes could be a problem because late on loading and catching a major traffic especially in downtown area of the city.
good,"The most enjoyable part was creating friendships with your fellow employees. Management needed work, they wouldn't listen to recommendations of their newer employees, so the employees would leave. A typical day at work was usually very busy, not with the customers, but with the work load itself. We never really got much time with customers, and when we did, we had a hard time helping them because we usually did not have the product they were looking for. I learned things like what not to do if I was in management position and I also learned that I would prefer to not work for that company again."
good,"On the nightshift I had my aisle on the shop floor to replenish stock."
good,Worked here while going to school at Kwantlen. There was a lot of respect towards shifts working with my school schedules.Managers were nice and co-workers were pleasant. Safeway wasn't a bad place to work.
good,"As a high school student making his first venture into the job-world, i got hired on as a courtesy clerk. I have now been with the company for well over a year and let me first say one thing. I am grateful for my time here. As a high school kid without much job experience, Safeway played a vital role in turning a somewhat sheltered, even reserved 17 year-old into a professional customer service representative that I believe I am today. Safeway was my first chance to step out and get an idea of what working life would be like. I got along with my colleagues much better than i had anticipated and do not regret working for them in the slightest. Unfortunately, that is where my praise has to end."
good,Safeway is a great place to shop the service there is excellent if you need anyt hi g the courtesy clerks there will help you find the items your shopping for and if you have allot of groceries they will help you out to your vehicle with it
good,"Management needed work, employees friendly. Shifts were good. Things offered were not followed through. Not much room for advancement."
good,It was an very easy job I just couldn't accept the pay much longer for the work I was doing .. I gotten attached to my patients and they ended up passing away & it took a toll on me as well ..
good,Fast paced working environment with high stress and poor management most of the time. Can be a good starting job for someone in high school or someone looking to gain retail and customer service experience.
good,"They work you and if you aren't careful they'll work you, below pay grade. They do appreciate a great worker though cause you do get hours. The employees are amazing people, some management excluded."
good,"Low paying job, Benefit and perks are okay if you are full time. Job duties may not be worth the money. No/slow opportunity for promotion."
good,"I worked at Safeway a while ago, so I wouldn't really know how they operate now, but when I worked there I had lots of problems with the girl managers and shift leads. They were rude to me since the first day, but other than them It was a pretty good first job. They only paid me $9.50, but we got paid weekly so it was Okay, but it was hard saving a weekly paycheck of 9.50 an hour."
good,The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customer's and unorganized mangers. I learn patients and skills to interact with people even when im not at work
good,"Safeway provides minimal on-the-job training and uses the 'sink or swim' method quite liberally and has a very high turnover."
good,"They claim people can advance and just because they don't have a diploma or degree, they sabotage any opportunity for advancement, even though that person trying has done just about every position in the store. There is no tips allowed to be accepted, and if a customer insists on giving one the employee is to put it in a donation container at a checkstand."
good,good place to work at and learn new things about the store and the customers who shop there everyday  good team members to work around
good,A typical day at Safeway required excellent customer service and technique. From using the cash register to designing a floral arrangement. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy.
good,It was easy but physically demanding work. It was nice that we could just work fast without having to worry about customers being in the store because I was on the night crew. My coworkers were generally friendly and I enjoyed working there. I was hit by a drunk driver and was injured and contracted MRSA during probation and was let go by my manager.
good,I enjoy working at the store I work at right now however I can not make a living doing this job. There are a lot of changes with the company and it seems like there is always something that needs to be done differently.I am trying to move on to a new career. I have stayed with this job because of the medical benefits and I have been loyal to my co-workers when there is a lot to do.
good,I was Cashier.  Lot of product numbers.  Some managers were hard to talk to.  Co-workers were great. The hardest part was memorizing the produce and bakery codes.  I enjoyed working with the puplic.
good,"Worked on the butchery counter at safeways for 3 years before moving on to running the dairy department."
good,"allowed to do the work trained for "
good,Good job until taken over by Alberstons Company.Going back to doing things we did 20 years ago that did not work. All of the current Management people are stressed and looking for a way out
good,Provided customers the best shopping experience. One of the best teams in the industry to enhance one's skill set and advance career as it's the great place to be.
good,I felt that the management took a lot more breaks then was allowed. They went outside to smoke a lot on every break they took. It seemed like they took about 5 breaks per shift. Completely unfair and stuck up management.
good,I went to work at 2am in the morning to cook doughnuts  I had to quit this job because the repetition caused an injury to my shoulder and i could no longer do the job
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the constant interaction with people. On a typical day, I accomplish interpersonal conversations with customers, associates and vendors along with completing my tasks for the day; while also being enthusiastic about service. All of those factors are rewarding at the end of the day knowing that I pulled off a successful day."
good,"No preparation at all for the work I did, Safeway cutted my working hours in half in some ocassions, Manager wasn't very friendly, poor job conditions, they change staff very often"
good,"working here was pretty simple and easy great sense of a team."
good,Safeway is a case by case company. Every store is different. Every manager and their way of doing things is different. Safeway can either be a room to fail or a room to grow.
good,hard to grow unless you suck up and know the right people. If you don't suck up you don't get anywhere. Some of the people are literally still in high school and they start stuff or bring drama into the work environment. Some of the high school students are sometimes more mature than the adult employees.
good,job has good beneifts but lousy management. you are overworked to the brink of exhaustion. the hours are horrible as well as the days off your treated like nothing and you start to feel underapreciated
good,a day for me is start at 2 am fry donuts and bake breads.on Sunday and Wednesday i do the package ordering.i also run the bakery when the manager is off.i feel i would be a great asset to your company because iam a heard  worker and i enjoy learning new things.
good,Safeway was a fun and fast paced work place. It was difficult at times but also easy and well maintained. The managers and workers were also very respectful and courteous.
good,"A typical work day:"
good,The store has strict policies and procedures that are expected to be followed.  I don't see that they are consistent with this with all employees equally.
good,Not the best company to work for.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with lack of integrity.  Great customer service and safety culture.  Every store is different.
good,"Safeway has the ability to be an excellent company to work for as benefits (vacation, sick time, etc) are exceptional. Due to continue attempts to save money they try to make this up by continually cutting employees hours. They sacrifice good customer service due to this."
good,"Recent merger has created uncertainty and retention issues...those who have stayed  have increased work and responsibility with no additional compensation, or retention incentive. Likely to become more challenging over time"
good,if stable and steady is what youre looking for it will not be fond here.Not just because they are safeway but because it goes hand in hand with retail. grocery stores dont expect you to ask for weekends off.
good,"A typical work day involves the Pharmacy doing around 200 prescriptions. I have great co- workers ( 3 other techs, and 2 pharmacists) working with them is a great benefit to the job."
good,"Bleep--Bleep--Bleep, scanning items hour after hour. How exciting!"
good,Never had my potential prowess at this workplace. Only gave me 3 days of part time work. My co workers were helpful at times but they held up to being individual players instead of a team.
good,"When working a produce shift I survey my department first, seeing what I need on the sales-floor right away. I lift boxes, organize the backroom, and check inventory.  "
good,"pays good but they dont really care about employees. strictly about business, doesn't care if work practices are unsafe, especially for women."
good,"Busy, multitask work."
good,"Customers thrive on their experience inside your store, if they cant find ANYTHING their looking for, they will still come back if the help and customer service is there. You start at the bottom, but if you work hard they will move you up quickly."
good,the company has no concept of loyalty or commitment.  people who leave the company are recruted and fast racked over others.  management is always on the chopping block
good,"Working third shift as  night stocker for Safeway you seriously have NO life. The schedule is 11pm-7:30am. A full-time schedule is six nights a week, and the work is so labor intensive that you are too exhausted to do much of anything by the time you go home in the morning. Also, your one night off a week is going to be a Monday-Thursday night, not a weekend night, especially not a Friday night."
good,"Safeway has now been purchased by Albertsons.  In the past, their programs for Diversity were high value."
good,This definitely was not my dream job and it felt like management was more about their number versus being about making the work place a good environment.
good,From 16 year old kids to aging grandparents every grocery usually runs the gamut of the current generations for employees.  Everyone needs groceries but not everyone wants to shop for them like they would at their favorite restaurant or clothing store in the mall so peoples opinions of you vary greatly and allow you to become comfortable dealing with a wide variety of people.
good,Everyone works together to complete tasks and take care of customers.
good,clock in check deilivery manifest ( have all cus receites) operation check on del trk load trk according to route depart store and start route return to store unload empty groceiry containers turn in any paper work I thought management could do more as far as making drivers more accountable for there actions job is very physicaly demanding and most enjoyable thing is leaving store on time to start route
good,"A typical day at work for me was to go in for 8 hours. If I opened which was most days, I prepared hot and cold food to be sold. I spoke to and rang up customers. I learned that I loved to help people out and talk to people. Management was not satisfactory, very unorganized, although she was very nice. Co-workers made work easier to get through, luckily we were a good team so poor management was easy to overcome. The most rewarding part of the job? Definitely receiving gratitude and thanks from customers for helping them out and providing great service and a good experience."
good,"You have your daily tasks, and if you do them correctly and in a timely manner you will do just fine.  There are not many advancement opportunities once you get past the courtesy clerk position.  Pay raises are based on hours worked and not talent, skill level, or production."
good,Mgmt only cares about bodies being there..preferential treatment and favoritism are boundless if your not sucking up to higher ups you get no where.If your friends with anyone in Mgmt your set for life
good,A good Fortune 500 Company. It provides career opportunities in marketing.
good,You can gain a lot experience work at Safeway. You can move upin the company very fast.
good,"For the most part I liked working there. I did have a few issues though. For example corporate is more worried about making a huge profit than keeping their employees and customers happy. It was a very busy store and upper management didn't really have an efficient way of scheduling employees, especially to keep up with the work flow. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was also some of the customers, some of them were always friendly and very understanding of our situation. My coworkers were great, they were very helpful with my training and also very knowledgeable. I learned how to use a cash register, I also learned a lot about customer service."
good,at the location I work at managerment could be a little better but meeting new people makes it worth it. benefits and pay rates could be worked on more. the company could give their employees a little more to show that they appreciate us.
good,"The job is repetitive but easy."
good,"Worked as a deli manager.  Managed eight employees, and wrote weekly schedules for the department.  I was responsible for inventories and product orders."
good,My typical day at working for Vons would be....I would clock in at 5am M-F arrive into my back room clear way and organize back room for vendors/co-workers to bring product in at 6am. My main priority was to make sure that vendors were bringing in product we actually needed also making sure the back room was a clear environment for my co workers to pass through. Hardest part of the job well  nothing was really hard about it except the paperwork work part because it was boring.Enjoyable part of the job was knowing that we had all the product we needed to supply our customers.
good,"Being a courtesy clerk at safeway is the most diverse job you will ever have. It's also the first job you get...you do the most and get paid the least. When i say that i mean a blue collar position..working your way up to management is another matter, they definitely had responsibility. Generally i meet and get along with people wherever I work and safeway was no different. Reality of the workplace is rather unfortunate in the retail world....no one wants you to advance (by that i mean your fellow employees) The management was really good at my store and they were very good at organizing schedules and breaks."
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers, a typical day at work is just the ordinary things that u would perform working for the company. We performed any duties that needed to be completed."
good,"Lack of communication, TOO many egos in charge, conflicting Distribution centers and Reclamation, OUTDATED TECH from the 1980's, NOT streamlined... EVERYTHING IS CONFUSING AND COMPLICATED because it ALL CONFLICTS"
good,Safeway has all of the old company culture that most young college grads would not like.  The compensation is less than fair which is very unfortunate.  Work load is not bad and most of the teams are very enjoyable.
good,I like working for Safeway. Employees always helped each other out. Hardest part of my job was when I had to leave to move away. I enjoyed working with the management to learn how I move up in the company.
good,I worked the overnight production shift and enjoyed making the deli and salad case clean and inviting for customers in the morning. I most of all miss my customer interaction and building a relationship with them.
good,"I did the closing of the store by making sure things were stocked in the front ends. I emptied trashes and collected carts outside. Coworkers were ok to get along with. hardest part was dealing with irate customers, easiest part was when the job was done."
good,Some of the managers were overly controlling and didnt want to listen to anything anyone had to say. The others that werent like that were great to work with very energetic all around good people. They had scheduling problems were 1 employee in my department would have a lot of overtime and everyone else was cut between 10-20 hours a week if they were lucky.
good,"You clock-in and start your day with the task they employ you to do. You do sweep-logs twice an hour, to check for any safety hazard down the shopping aisles. The management is very chill if you apply yourself, but moving up is a different story. Sometimes the co-workers refuse to pull their weight, so be sure to report to management. The hardest part of the job, if any, is getting the tasks your management asks you to get done in a set time. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the fruition of your hard-work in the end completed."
good,. I learned that it takes persistence and dedication to keep your job . My coworkers were always a lot of fun.  . The most enjoyable part I would have to say was my coworkers. we always had fun making jokes.
good,"I wish I could get more hours rather than working once or twice a week. When going into the establishment while I'm not working they're always calling workers down to the floor. Most of my co-workers are great to work with and they're super helpful! I feel like I didn't learn a lot in my training. Well, enough to put me on the floor right away like they did to me."
good,"I enjoy working with my co-workers. I learn something different everyday. The most enjoyable part of my work is learning something new, like making pudding cakes. The hardest part of my job is that we have a small crew and there tends to be more work for one person to finish. I try my best to get things done, but i often end up staying late to finish the job. The one thing that I would like to learn is to do inventory. I mostly learned how to do all the paperwork, except inventory. Hopefully my manager teaches me that soon."
good,"Typical day starts off by cleaning the wellness center making sure its sterilize & neat. In the pharmacy Id open up so opening duties included processing the cue, faxing doctors, processing electronically sent prescriptions and customer service. I learned a lot more in pharmacy than in my own field  as a phlebotomist as for managment I feel like their careless about their employees. My co-workers were awsome very helpful and great teachers i have learned a lot from them coming into a field Id never thought Id even work with. The hardest part of my job dealing with insurances it can take time but with patients all is possible & the most enjoyable part of the day id say is costumer service besides serving the in their needs i love interacting with patients with time you remember faces and I had plenty of costumers that would always come just to even say hello."
good,The hardest part of the job is not being allotted enough labor and employees to ensure success.
good,"Preparing food and serving customer.  "
good,"When I first hired on at Vons,com, it was not a career decision.  It was, in all honesty, a fill in job until I could return to land surveying; going on five and one half years.  The job itself is very simple, straight forward.  I drive a company delivery van (modified Ford E series cargo van) to deliver groceries in various regions of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties.  I am only a part-time employee.  Each store has only 1 full-time driver, with the exceptions of Burbank and West Hollywood.  I deliver to houses, apartments, mobile home parks and businesses.  The hardest of this job is having to go up and down stairs, primarily at apartments, multiple times, to deliver groceries.  Some days are easy and some can be very difficult, especially if the problem starts inside the store.  Issues such as computer problems to pick groceries, the online register (aka virtual till) to process orders and/or the shoppers (those that pick the food for us) run late, can cause major delays for drivers.  The smallest delay could cost a driver as much as one hour of delivery time, which can never be made up.  As a result, he will have multiple late orders.  I am a very detailed oriented person.  I pride myself on being on time for anything.  So when I am late leaving the store, it bothers me because I feel I am letting the customers down as a representative of Vons.com.  "
good,Working with all employee's
good,"as it was my first or 2nd job, pay and hours were poor as was management but overall good work place especially in beautiful silicon valley"
good,"Good benefits, full benefits after two years, vacation pay,anniversary pay, birthday pay, union job, management was slightly unprofessional in certain matters, Overall experience: 4"
good,Work environment is great most of the time. I have a great team of people I work with on a daily basis ( most days ). My boss is not good with delegation and he is unfortunately not pleasant to work with all the time. He does nothing to step in when there is a difficult patient. He makes us deal with them. However. He is not all bad all the time.
good,I would only recommend seeking employment at this job to people who are in school or are otherwise working towards another career goal and need something with flexible scheduling options (sometimes too flexible).
good,"There is too little help for too many side tasks, besides the normal day to day business."
good,"If I'm opening up (at 5:00 am), all items that have an expiry date as of the next day (ie. today is the 5th, the expiry date on product is the 6th), are to be removed and 'distressed' (which means that they will be either thrown out or composted) and then marked with a reduced price of 50% for consumers to purchase. These reduced products are put out for half a day and then either thrown out or composted. Removing all 'expired' bakery goods and marking them with a reduced price takes approximately 2 hours. The hearth oven breads are taken out and displayed for purchase in the 'hut'. Once the reduced items have been dealt with and the 'hut' has been set up, the morning baked goods (bagels, french breads & muffins) are cooled enough to package and put out. This takes approximately half and hour to an hour. While these items are being packaged and put out, I'm also serving/assisting customers. After the morning baked goods have been taken care of, bread needs to be sliced and put out. A second worker usually starts about 8:30/9:00 am, at which time I would take my first break of 1/2 hour (this is considered my lunch break because I would punch out and then punch back in). After the lunch break, it would be packaging, slicing or assisting customers. Also would be taking cake orders or writing on cakes. Once all the packaging has been done, would assist wherever needed."
good,Well a regular day is always helping customers to there wants and need and to help them the most up curtious customer service you can give them. Also getting things done and knowing whats more important from less impotant
good,"What they require if hire good Customer service, team players, hard worker."
good,Learning all different aspects of problem solving for customers. Co Workers for the most part encouraging in one anothers performance and continued success of our daily business.
good,"Co-workers are not welcoming to newcomers, very quiet environment, managers don't assist with issues employees may have"
good,A typical day running a store for Safeway consists of prioritizing the daily tasks with multiple competing deadlines and requirements. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with the negative corporate culture and trying to maintain high employee morale within the store. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the employees in the store as they truly are dedicated to their work.
good,A typical job involved a balance of time management with all aspects of the job to make sure everything was done for that day and the next. I enjoyed working independently to get the job done and was alway able to do so. Co-workers were great and the managers I worked for in different locations were always great and helpful when that was needed. The most enjoyable part of this job was that I was doing what I loved and had been trained to do in school and the people working around me could see that I was capable and new what was needed to get the job done.
good,"willing to work around personal schedules, friendly work environment,"
good,The deli is a very fast paced job with plenty of work to be done which makes a work day going by before you know it. There are plenty of hours to work
good,"Work/life balance only rates so high because my department (fuel) was very small, so lack of seniority didn't hurt my hours too much.  The low pay, however, made the lack of full hours rather painful to living.  Union contract said that one would have to work a minimum of four consecutive weeks at full hours, without someone being on medical leave or vacation to facilitate that, in order to get full-time work.  They NEVER allowed that to happen.  Their health plan was a token gesture, only getting really good if you stayed with the company for a long time.  Didn't bother with it, as it didn't cover a couple of areas (dental and mental health care) that are more crucial for me than anything.  Job security was solid, thanks to the labor union.  Say what you will about unions, but they do make it hard to be fired without a seriously good reason.  Unfortunately, this also made it near impossible to get rid of employees who were grossly incompetent that everyone hated.  And hours are only effected by seniority, not by ability, which meant a superstar employee would always lose hours to an older, unintelligent, unpleasant, absolutely awful worker who was only still there because she knew how to pull the labor union's strings.  How good the managers were came down to the individual in the end, with my department manager being pretty chill and good at his job.  At the same time, we had a bakery manager who seemed stoned most of the time and often mixed up price tags.  Job culture has two sides: co-workers and customers.  The kindest description I can give of typical retail customers"
good,"I left this company because there were two people on vacation in our department, we were understaffed as is. I was the closing shift so at the end of the day all the blame for the department shortcomings was laid on me. I decided if this how you’ll treat an employee of 2 years who is working harder then ever before I’ll go else where"
good,"I've worked at numerous locations, but the one I worked at most recently was awful. Managers aren't concerned with having the store run well, only with passing inspections from higher-ups. Managers are also slow to help out on the check stands, but don't make a significant effort to hire more people, and I was lied to about where I would be working. I was hired to work the Customer Service desk, but had to help out on the check stands quite often. Eventually the stopped putting me there, but told me they were working on getting me back to customer service. This was a lie, as they were training other people on customer service."
good,"While it's difficult to get a promotion, you can still get pay raises based on the hours you work. The more hours you work, the sooner your pay will rise. The union they have requires everyone to start out part-time with only a few exceptions. It will be tough getting to full-time and therefore getting benefits as well."
good,"If you don’t mind a variable schedule (week to week) and can devote at least 20 hours plus a few to the job consistently, Safeway is a good place to earn a part-time paycheck and have a fairly stable job. Most managers at my store are serious about the job and generally good to work with. The work is not glamorous or very lucrative, but can be satisfying at times if you realize your own worth. Sometimes slow and steady actually wins the race."
good,The work environment was a bit rough it seemed like certain employees were mad at each other and just mad. I just wanted to come in and do the best job I could do. Pay was fair and I got enough hours.
good,"Union company benefits ok but pay is small to what is expected of you a lot of hours cut to meet store sales."
good,Safeway was a great entry job. It was my first job after babysitting for 8 years. Plenty of different positions to try and explore. Very flexible with scheduling
good,The job started off okay. Until they ask for more and more from you. Management doesn’t care about anybody but themselves and making their job easier on themselves
good,"i did not have a good job experience. the Safeway in Bellevue the management was not friendly they never worked with  your schedule, i ended up leaving on medical leave and i wont go back"
good,If you’re adaptable then this company is great for you. People development was my favorite thing to come to do with future managers. Very busy but overall good.
good,Working here is a great place for anyone who is in high school or is looking for a place to start a job. Management isn’t all that great but that can be different from location to location.
good,Min wage for max duties. I fill in as front end manager with no increase in pay. 10 cents an hour pay increase for every 1200 hours work till step 10.
good,"I started my grocery career young, and it was at Safeway, night crew no less."
good,"This job is perfect if you are just looking for an extra income; a second job. However, I highly do not recommend this as a priority job. Great for students."
good,"It's a fast paced environment.Its a very physical demanding job, it's a job for a younger person.You need to be able micro manage in the enviroment.Being Conscience and alert and attending to the customers"
good,Let go just before the trial period like the rest of the new hires. Automated check outs took our jobs as well as several long time employees. Mine was to be a part time for as long as I wanted. Nothing said to any of us that it was a Temp job and they knew the automated checkout machines were going in long before we were hired. The manager was great and I had top reviews but his lips were sealed knowing of the up coming lay offs. I have been told he has since left Safeway and works for another company. Part time people got no benefits at all.
good,At the beginning of the day it would be very fast pace an about 5 o’clock it would slow down. I learnt how to have patience With the customers and have good time management. The hardest part of the job is making sure each customer gets help in a good amount of time. I really enjoyed the opportunity to interact with so many different people everyday as my first job.
good,"When i worked here management was needing work, not only from the deli but store as well. Things have changed management is better at some things, alot of younger kids working they need more training on how to be friendly"
good,"My store always lacked workers and management wasn't the best.  "
good,"Was a produce clerk at safeway, and found it was constantly the same task day in and day out, and it got quite tedious. No advancements on my job (I.e. washing and cutting displays, making orders, taking stock) it was just restocking shelves. Wasn't my cup of tea."
good,"On the other hand if your young and you stick it out you could make it a career. If you stay find a department you like and learn all about it."
good,Good job for starting out with decent benefits and a flexible schedule. Pay is lackluster in the long term and opportunities for advancement are thin.
good,"The working environment was fun but the management was partial to older working staff and it was unfair to the new workers , it wasn't an environment I could really grow up"
good,"I came back to work with some fellow coworkers that made the working atmosphere better.  Lack of management, new procedures and the lack of hiring new people hindered the daily work that needed to be finished.  Having consistently 1-2 people understaffed in the section of the grocery store I worked in halted the completion of our daily tasks."
good,"the job was trash and the management was trash, employees were pretty cool at times but over all it sucked the life out of me and made me hate my life"
good,The job was awesome loved the staff the management was horrible on how the treat there staff the pick and choose on who they like the hardest part of the job is always bringing in the carts and carry outside and bagging especially when they only have one person working the one thing I loved about was helping the customers
good,"While the customers and other employees were pleasant for the most part, management often crumpled the paper bag of a healthy work environment. Employees are often required to work extra hours and school requirements are not always respected."
good,Most days were like trying to put 6 gallons of water in a 5-gallon bucket. I was not uncommon to have not enough hours to complete all the tasks and corporate micromanages the stores to the point of lost sales and disgruntled staff. I really enjoyed working with the people I worked alongside and most of the in-store management was really quality.
good,"Management depends on who you talk to in my opinion. Always understaffed on checkers and other departments. (The staff can say the same thing) Some management will treat you like trash. When people call out on any reason they will talk to you a day later. "
good,I didn't have a great experience there because at the time there was no manager in the department I was working in. I believe it is better now but I will not go back.
good,The job is easy but they don't give enough hours to pay a bill was looking for full time but gave me part time hours. Some customer are very nice and very friendly.
good,"Upper mgt. Visits the store does not introduce themselves (I think us peons should know who the boss is) and Why don't they jump in and help instead of watching customers walk because they  haven't been helped yet. I worked for another co. When the big shots visited, if we were busy they would take off their suit coat loosen their tie, roll up their sleeves and help doing whatever needed to be done. At Safeway they stand there and wonder why customers are walking away and ask why. Has anyone told them we are EXTREMELY SHORT HANDED! Don't they get it. And why can't corp. Mgt. See how things really are day to day instead of us putting on a show like everything is running smoothly They really need to reinstate the training program new hires get thrown in to a dept. and basically figure it out on  their own because again we are SHORT HANDED.  Where are the new hires that want to work? My dept. Gets lazy people with no common sense. Who's doing the screening?  On the good side med.benifits, eye and dental coverage with low premiems.  I have been w/ Safeway 8 yrs gone thru 10 mgrs. What's wrong with this co.?"
good,Safeway was an OK place to work the managers were not very knowledgeable of their jobs or how to get task done in a timely manner. learned a lot about managing a department under tight time constraints and the workplace culture was okay.
good,"open was wonderful,setting up for the whole day from cooking prepwork to filling orders  supplies stocking/inventory.there is something to learn daily.hardest being a closer cleaning braking down all machiens nightly.love the people the go go hard work that did'nt stop."
good,"Safeway was a fun place to work but the overall management was poor. My manager was stressed to pull product and sales with little resources so that in itself stressed everyone working there. The workplace was fun for the first few weeks but quickly grew stressful and overbearing. My recent position with them left me running the department completely by myself with almost zero training. As I said, management was a sham and it left no place to grow."
good,"great company to work for ,but.union I dont particularly care for. Benefits you have to wait a year to get which I did not like due to the fact that i am diabetic"
good,"While it has been well over a year since I have worked at Safeway, from what I remember, A typical day at work normally consisted of: attending carts, bagging, checking products and prices for customers, serving customer needs, running the register (at times), returning unwanted products to shelves, facing products throughout the whole store, restocking dairy products and drinks, collecting and throwing all trash at the end of the night, cleaning and restocking bathrooms, cleaning spills and other possible messes, and providing carry out service. While the work was often overwhelming and the pay wasn't really worth the hassle, especially in the case of being the only Courtesy Clerk for a closing shift, it taught me the importance of efficiency and prioritizing. I learned a lot about how a fast-paced work environment functions on micro-management, and this job taught me the leadership and efficiency I needed to get ahead as a student manager in my current work-place."
good,"management is bad with scheduling and are lazy. pay was great and so were tips. overall not bad place to work, but was annoying at times. weekends are busy and more fun to work while week days drag."
good,I knew It was going to be one of my least favorite jobs in the safeway deli. It was the only place that would take me for the hours I was available and also for having been a stay at home mom for a long while. While I ended up loving the people I worked with I felt pressured to be super fast pace which I understand but there is no better pay than minimum wage and people expect you to pour your soul into this job. Not to mention I met a ton of people who were enslaved to safeway bc of their benefits. I felt the need to get out as I didn't want that to happen to me. If you have nowhere else to go and need to start at the bottom I recommend Safeway.
good,"Very fast average pace of work at my specific location, employees were very hard working, yet dissatisfied with their work. Sterile and uncomfortable environment."
good,"I personally had a good time working there, but most of the management and customers made the job difficult from interactions to the management just not caring about you as an employee."
good,"Busy and safe"
good,"Must know item code to efficiently ring customers at the check out counter."
good,"Its a good first job to work for, but really nothing more. everything there is meh, the company obviously doesn't really care about their employees very much."
good,"Well they say there is benefits, it is only after three months and a SOLID 40 hours or more a week (which is rare). No pay raise for courtesy clerk position. Not very good management. On the other hand, it is a great friendly environment with flexible hours/"
good,When i first started at Safeway i Loved it but a couple of years while working there my manger left the store to a new younger man that wasn't to nice and didn't play far.
good,"I loved working there. It was a great environment.  However, there was no help, training or assistants you had several jobs but only one small paycheck."
good,Everyday was different. It was either a slow day or a fast paced day. The management was slacking and it made everything difficult when the managers weren't doing their job correctly.  The culture itself was mellow. No trouble with any employees.
good,I was a home shopper at vons and at one point my department manager was gone for over a month due to medical issues and the store manager refused to call in another manager and had myself and the employees of my department kind of just winging it. Myself and 2 others were slightly trained in what the managers responsibilities and we were able to do mostly everything but myself and those coworkers were doing the managers job without the managers pay and there were days where I had to work 12 hours due to the lack of employees in that department and the drivers who would pick up orders refusing to do their jobs
good,"A typical day there would consist of breaking down your loads when you got there at 5am or earlier. After bring it down from the dock area. When I was there it felt like a morgue. The manager at the time made it feel all dead in there. She did not like most of her staff, she felt that if she were to get rid of some of the staff, it would make the store better. It didn't. That was the hardest part of the job, seeing great people fired for nothing. The enjoyable parts of the job, was summer time, that's when Conifer really came alive. What I learned, was to keep your head down and try not to make any mistakes."
good,"I believe that they could improve on security and a more friendly work environment. I learned somethings about working in a customer service based environment but I feel as though I have more to, and willing, to learn."
good,"Worked off the one on Camino Del Sur Store #3323 and Sarah (the manager at the time I worked there) did a HORRIBLE job placing people in departments. The reason why we had horrible sales was because we did not have enough people equipped in each department making sure that customers are getting in and out in a timely manner. The only reason why I stayed so long was for my coworkers who were willing to step in and assist whenever I needed. Overall, would not recommend this job to anyone unless they are desperately seeking their first job as a high schooler but even then you are taken advantage of."
good,safeway was a very friendly and welcoming workplace. Easy environment to adapt to with employees willing to help whenever needed. Management was very relaxed but very unorganized which created communication problems around my schedule and which managers were responsible for what. I was suppose to have a set schedule which had been communicated with my manager in advance. several times my manager booked me on days i was not suppose to work. When talking to the store manager about these issues i was having with my schedule he was very confused and kept sending me back to talk with my department manager instead of fixing the issue himself.
good,It is always a lot of work with not a lot of help. However if you really need a job they will always be there so I cant say much bad about them. I do wish they didn't change so much over the years. They used to be a really good company to work for.
good,"It was okay for a high school/summer break job. some of the managers weere good, some were not. overall i enjoyed working there at the time, and it was a good experience."
good,"I did the job of a manager at the pay of a cashier. I loved it, but was given more than I could handle and was in physical pain all of the time (I am physically disabled and not supposed to stand or walk very much). I trained, cashiered, looked after customer service (including floral and front end bakery), and was Health and Safety Representative. It was fun and I enjoyed my customers. Wish I was still there."
good,"Safeway is a great company for a first job. It pays, and they are pretty flexible with hours. However, I would not suggest making a career here. Their benefits are just not the greatest."
good,"•	Responsible for Deploying and Supporting Windows NT and Windows 2000 on a dual network of Windows and Novell "
good,"It was my first real job out of high school, it was ok but it took two years to get full time hours, the medical benefits were good though, I didn't have to worry about my teeth"
good,"A typical day is you show up to work do your best and get complained at for things you could not do. What did i learn lots of things customer service, handling money, physical endurance and how to learn with little to no training. Management was decent as long as you stayed on their good side. The culture was disappointing. the hardest part of the job was dealing with employees who did not want to work."
good,"The work itself was by and large enjoyable, but the people, (at least in my department) were self serving to a fault. Everyone only looked out for themselves and the hostile environment created by the more senior employees, made it awful to work there."
good,I worked at Safeway for almost 2 years and it was a fair job to work for until they switched out a good manager and the employees begin to have me do their dirty work for them.
good,"being a cashier at safeway is awesome really fast pace get to no a lot of people."
good,During my employment at Safeway i can truly say i enjoyed my time here. The mangers/supervisors and the coworkers were truly amazing.  Working here has taught me a lot about professionalism and handling different situations.
good,"Schedule varies depending on availability and department."
good,Safe Way was a fine place to work at. It was very friendly but had terrible communication management and employees. And it was a joy working with my coworkers.
good,"You can do better, even for this area. Same starting supervisor pay for 5 years. Not adjusting to the cost of living in the area. Always hiring...not a good sign."
good,"There was no extra help when you truly needed it when opening and closing. No raises or advancement based on a person's job performance, it all came down to the Union and Contracts. Too many duties fell on just 1 person and no help or extra time to get things done (Placing Daily Department Orders, Deli Trays, Grab & Go Sandwiches and Salads, etc), lack of support from Upper Management."
good,"management was great, but overall work environment wasnt swell, overworked in the little hours they gave me, and was rushing everywhere then all of a sudden id be standing around doing nothing for hours."
good,This was my first job and one that I thought I might stick with until I moved. It was fine as long as I was able to get away from the public who seem to believe that they are entitled to treat you like dirt.
good,I started out in the deli and quickly advanced to assistant manager. “Training” was supposed to take up to a month but I was never properly trained. We were always understaffed but had to help customers promptly while also getting our daily tasks done. The store manager was reasonable and I could usually confide in him and he would help me relay information to my manager. I always had enough hours but I hadn’t been in a management position I wouldn’t have.
good,sometimes you are the only one on the job having to do the job of 3 people sometimes there's 3 people doing the job of one. just hope you get a good manager.
good,I learned a lot about work and there are many training videos that managers are offer you to learn something new about positions and backups helper. It's pretty sweet to have a vacation paid.
good,I’m not sure if it’s the area I work in but the Deli OPS is a nightmare! You will never be good enough and it’s their way no matter what the circumstances are! They are constantly changing the rules and expectations. They don’t care that you have a family they only want you having split days off for their benefit! They will cut your hours but want perfection. They will rip you to shreds and want a professional relationship with you! You cannot treat people that way and expect good results! Positive reinforcement is the best way to manage any type of people! It’s proven that positive reinforcement works! Most issues are swept under the rug. Lots of favoritism not enough follow through with issues! No good communication between management and employees! I feel like I’m constantly compromising my faith because of this company!
good,"On a typical day, I would have to clean bathrooms, bring in shopping carts from outside in any/all weather, help customers unload their groceries into their cars, take both perishable and non-perishable items back to either shelves or to the designated department, emptying garbage cans, and putting recyclables into the baler (among other tasks). The environment would go from near-empty to slammed quickly. My coworkers were nice, and kept the job interesting and fun. "
good,The staff there was not bad. In fact over all I would say they where great. But the pay was simply not enough for the work put in. The nature of our customers was such that it made the job almost intolerable compared to other establishments I have worked at and they where times where I was afraid someone was going to rob us.
good,"My typical day at work was usually unorganized. Being as though things were not always not complete on shifts before mine. I would have to finish or pick up after an earlier shift over all it was pretty smooth. I learned how to multi task , triple task at times when it was busy. Also made me better with my time management and people skills. Management was leiniant on their shifts sometimes inconsistent. Usually it was a well managed day they managers were there if you needed help or was confused on a certain task. Work culture was pretty consistent the environment was well managed the employees were nice and they seemed pretty focuesd on thier job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with an customer who was out of control and saying things that were not too nice and not telling the truth to others. The most enjoyable part of my job was going in and seeing the smile on the customers face when u interact with them. Even informing them on some information was pleasing on a dail basis."
good,"Great first job , fast pace in that area, will be offered overtime a lot . Most managers were easy to work with . Great co-workers. Different ways to move up in the the company"
good,The management team made it hard to enjoy the job but the costumers are what made the job worth while. It was a busy environment and there were always tasks to complete.
good,"Can be a fun easy paced working environment with good vibes and happy people. Or can be a stressful, chaotic and unfair place. Really depends on your Manager and if they like you. Definitely lacks structure if you ever wanna move up"
good,"I only enjoyed my time at Safeway because of my coworkers. The work itself, cashiering in particular, is quite repetitive and mindless. Once you have memorized the produce codes, there is not much thinking involved. This made for shifts that felt extremely long."
good,"First part of my work day involved cleaning up the aisles, then either bagging groceries, collecting buggies, and then returning products to shelf. Working into the night, I was tasked with locking the west doors, collecting garbage and doing last minute cleaning."
good,"This company sold their 3 store locations, in Florida, to Publix, in July of 2018.  They did offer severance pay to employees but did not offer relocation assistance to job locations outside of Florida, even though the company has a large number of stores all over the U.S. (Transfers were offered, but not relocation expenses!)."
good,"As much as I enjoyed getting to know and shadow experienced food clerks, meeting customers, and learning skills that are relevant to other retail jobs, a few managers in particular from my previous job at Safeway were very unprofessional and impatient when attempting to resolve issues involving other employees. I spoke to 2 different managers about having not been paid for two weeks, and it wasn’t until after I resigned that I was mailed the check for the two weeks’ pay. I wasn’t the only employee who had this problem at this particular location. Overall friendly environment, management just did not seem to be putting effort towards treating employees (food clerks, in particular) with respect. This of course isn’t true for every location, and was really the only issue. Definitely recommend Safeway to anyone looking for an entry level job."
good,"overall the job was okay, i got moved around alot at the store and never really knew what i was going to do any time i clocked on. normally the managers would drag me around to do their jobs instead of my own because they wanted to sit in the office and talk to eachother instead of their own jobs."
good,"fast pace, always running out of supplies, manager had poor inventory stills, scheduling, Favoritism, She kept the bakery Dirty, never set a good example, tons of safety issue"
good,"My typical day at work is having people yell at me or they are very inpatient."
good,fun environment but not a good place to make money and some employees favourite not based on how good you did the job and had promotions over good workers
good,"I really like the people I worked with at Safeway. Frankly, it is probably the reason I stayed there as long as I did. Upper management and the corporation as a whole as so much of their collective heads up their collective a**es that it makes the job stupid and almost undoable."
good,Day to day operations were fairly consistent. Management always were looking for something to complain about. Department hours rarely increased for busy holidays. Store management rarely provided support to departments that were struggling and was very stressful on corporate walk-through's. Having the right team made it bearable
good,"Over all my position and time at Safeway was satisfactory. The pay was decent and the job expectations were well balanced."
good,"Most difficult art of this job was, working with fellow employees who don't care about their job. Mostly teens working. Management was helpful. Pay was minimum wage with little chance of raise. Most enjoyable par of working as serving and helping customers."
good,The staff themselves are generally all great people. But the actual company is lacking in a definitive direction of how it wants to go about its business and who is their target market.
good,"A typical day at work is providing superior customer service in order to satisfy the customer, while ensuring I still get my job done."
good,"It was a good job to work at. I just couldn't stay because I had to relocate. It was a pretty simple job. I stocked shelves, returned carts, cleaned store. I.e. Swept, mopped, and cleaned bathrooms. Most employees were helpful and cheerful."
good,Safeway was my first place to work when I entered United States and it was very friendly atmosphere and my colleagues supported me on first steps in US soil.
good,Very fast paced.  Dealing with upwards 100 customers daily can be a bit stressful. Management was helpful.  A typical day would be making salads and making sure sandwich area was stocked
good,"A fun little job for a high school kid, i learned lots and has great interactions with people. It helped me communicate with people better and i learned alot"
good,"It's an solid grocery store that has nice coworkers and a pleasant working environment. I had a difficult manager to work with while I was a produce clerk so that made me want to jump ship. It's pretty strict and not quite laid back with it's rules."
good,At safeway i learned great customer service. I gained good dicipline and showing up to work on time. The hours were very ostersyizing so i was able to learn how to adapt quickly.
good,The company is very flexible both in terms of hours and positions that are available to work in but the clientele in the area is constantly very aggressive and current change in management is leading to some drastic changes in work environment.
good,"A good job if you need money and are going to school, other than that I would avoid it at all costs. That's not to say it was the most awful place to work, but they definitely didn't care about their work force."
good,"answered phones, filled prescriptions, filing, typing prescriptions, assist pharmacist, ring up customers in a friendly manor. had a good relationship with coworkers"
good,no room for advancement. Stuck in the same position. Asked for department transfers many times never given. Forced union dues for certain department so you barely if lucky make minimum wage.
good,Safeway is a company with a lot of catch up work to do. The competition in the past 35 years has a proven track record that customers demand more from their grocer. Customers spend much time and money in retail groceries.
good,"I help morning clerk with packaging products, breakdown and put away the frozen load, plus bake product for the day. Make sure crew members are productive and department running smoothly. The hardest is, it's a very high production environment on a daily bases, with a minimal department staff to do the work, with low pay wages."
good,"Pretty well balanced job, learned good social and life skills. Management was well done for the most part, didn't enjoy taking on responsibilities that were not in my job description, but wasn't too bad."
good,"My time working at the IT corporate offices of Safeway Inc. was neat.  I learned a lot about desktop support as this was my first job in the desktop support arena. Little did I know that our supervisor was only keeping us around (or was told to keep us around) until after the Y2K scare had come and gone without any of the nightmares happening that everyone was expecting.  All of the full time desktop support techs, but one, were let go on the same day in late February. Later we heard our supervisor rewarded herself with a big bonus for saving the company a bunch of money by switching to contractors.  Mostly the user community folks were pleasant to get along with.  I did get to go to Hawaii to fix some computers there (though I did not get much free time to enjoy the locale)."
good,"Very repetitive days as a cashier, lack of enthusiasm at work made for long days. Management was lacking and could have been improved.  The dress code made it very uncomfortable  to stand all day and was very restrictive. "
good,"it wasn't a bad place to work, but it was stressful and the life and work balance was hard for me. I worked there for a few months and had some issues with management."
good,"Most days are really busy and sometimes we do not have enough lines open. I learned how to handle a cash register properly, floral arrangements, and the preparation of fresh fruits. All coworkers I have worked with were nice and respectful. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the long lines, the most enjoyable part was working in the floral department. Management was excellent when I first started working there, but the longer I worked there we had multiple come and go to work as regular front end and store managers, some of whom had little knowledge of what was going on in the store."
good,"A typical day consisted of sorting out the routes to be dispatched to the drivers. We had to dispatch drivers to make pick ups and deliveries to various Safeway stores and vendors."
good,"build great relationships"
good,The only bad thing was management not doing their part as far as communiction. The lower people doing grunt work was wonderful to work with and always made the job interesting.
good,"This job is not for everybody, however I enjoyed my time there for the most part, everyone seems pretty laid back, except for one of the managers who ultimately made the job a lot harder for me."
good,I worked here while going to school. Not trying to advance. Management was flexible with my hours so that I could work and go to school. Not a bad team to work for at my store at least.
good,"A decent starting job. Though, the uniform could have been a bit more comfortable, and I wish my hours were more consistent, but shifts were assigned through seniority so it was understandable."
good,"Pretty straightforward work experience, good management, cashiering, stocking, system maintenance helping customers with fueling when necessary. not especially physically taxing for the most part."
good,"Safeway wasn't a bad place to work at, although I didn't feel like it was for me. I felt like I should be doing something that can get me to where I need to be."
good,"started as courtesy clerk, am now a checker, so there is room for advancement. A normal day means a variable degree of work. Management can be a mixed bag, some are amazing and some are horrible. Coworkers can also vary from friendly to cold. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the extremely inconsistent schedule, you could be working early shifts one week only to find yourself working closing shifts the next."
good,"The Bakery Manager Role at a scratch bakery with limited hours. Often not enough time in the day to get everything done. Wore multiple hates every day from Donut Fryer to Baker, Cake Decorator"
good,"As a student, they work around my schedule and allow me to have a flexible schedule. It's a relaxed job, but it can be kind of boring. Management is good."
good,"Working at Safeway is pretty okay. I worked there for about a year and I was promoted twice. I did not, however, receive a raise more than five cents. The hours are awful, you hardly ever get time off, but the management are decent. You don't get to pick your schedule, and they either give you hardly any hours or way too much."
good,Fast paced and must know your prices and what to do in a tight pinch. Must know about rain-checks and how to call on managers when needed. Always have a friendly face.
good,"For people needing extra income after retirement, or while going to school, this is a good job for you. Most people don't find advancement easy and pay raises are few and far between. However, you can join a Union their which will give you added security and additional respect from management. Most managers are strict but generally fair."
good,Company has changed tremendously since being acquired and merging with Albertsons. Work life balance is non existent. Everyone works by fear of loosing their job. This trickles down from the corporate office which places the district managers under a lot of stress which is then placed on the store manger. A lot of corporate employees have and still continue to be laid off. It makes one feel insecure about the future of th company. All and all I stay because I love working with and for people. I just want more security and transparency in the company I work for.
good,"I liked this job a lot, I loved my co-workers. Although, some weren't very nice. I enjoyed my time there when I worked there, it just wasn't the job for me."
good,We had a very high turnover rate due to frequently cut hours and no managerial professionalism. But the staff of the store and co-workers were nice and tried their best.
good,"Sadly, many of the managers were young and were not well trained or mentored. This led to micro-managing employees who were more knowledgeable and experienced than they were."
good,"Great company, must be flexible to work any shift, union regulated, premium benefits. Fast paced work in the deli, customers are awesome. If SafeWay wants you they will train you."
good,"the position I held was for the front deck customer service clerk. there was western union, money orders, lotto, lottery scratcher, rug doctor rentals."
good,I felt we gave good customer service. I learned how to run the cash registers and make Starbucks coffee. The hardest part was learning all he different drinks.
good,"Safeway is an ok place to work it is very unpredictable at times. My position has multiple managers above me Store Managers, Merchandisers and District Managers. Which means there is a numerous amount of direction for certain tasks. Other then that, Safeway has taught me how to problem solve properly and professionally. Working at Safeway I am meeting so many interesting people from all over with amazing stories and experiences to share."
good,"I begin my shift at 4am as a personal online shopper for safeway.com, schedule is not set so its hard to plan out your life with out a stable work schedule. management is good, fun place to work with nice people, the hardest thing is not making enough hours and going in so early, the most enjoyable thing about this job is building a good and healthy relationship with your coworkers and customers."
good,"customer treat worker that work in safeway like crab, manager most of the time doesn't care cause their work load. and depends on what location some are good."
good,helped costumers get there day going with coffee . interacted with costumers daily  managers sucked bad customers good ...... so times unfair and rude
good,When you do the same repetitive motions and say the same things over and over in a day it can get very tedious however the day goes by fast and your regulars make it worth it.
good,"In the nearly 13 years of experience I have gained within the Safeway companies, I have learned how to manage diverse groups of people, Run a million dollar business and exceed company goals."
good,"A day at work was always good due to the fact that as soon as you clocked in the day began. The fast paste cleaning, keep the store looking nice, stocking back items that were misplaced. Keeping the shopping carts filled with carts. The hardest part of the job was trying to bag the groceries fast without ripping the bags, which you get the hang of. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with your co workers. When it slows down a small talk while cleaning or putting back stocked items makes your day go by faster and before you know it, it's time for you to clock out."
good,"it was just a starter job to get in the habit of working, nothing special. I swept floors and did inventory most days, not really my type of work i would like to ideally do."
good,"* Rarely have any idle time as there's always something to do."
good,"The work environment was good, I liked the people I worked with. The pay was not great but most of the jobs available are entry level jobs that require no experience."
good,"It was mainly customer service-based job with great emphasis on making sure our customers are happy and satisfied with the pharmacy experience. "
good,"The daily routine was inconsistent. Employee call-ins proved to be a daily problem, and labor controls were tight. Often a heavy workload with little help."
good,"Doesn't take a whole lot of effort to become any sort of manager. With inexperienced managers, the turnover per department and in the stores is uncomfortably high. To the point that making an effort to learn peoples names becomes a joke. With that said, I learned a ton about customer service and how the grocery business works in general."
good,"super busy and have many tasks to do with little time, hours are flexible can request time off whenever. i learned how to work in a food workplace with many different equipemtns, such as an oven, hot case, big dishwashers, deep fryers, and steamers"
good,It was not bad working here although the the company itself is taking a downfall. The hours were good and pay a little bit more then other competing companies.
good,"There's no advancement at Safeway and they even cut hours. No one can survive off this job unless it is a part time pocket money job. It also doesn't offer insurance since people only work 25 hours."
good,"Courtesy Clerk position was a good position because it kept you moving and busy constantly. Checking position was very stressful and boring but easy. I learned how to manage stress with lines and customer complaints. Bookkeeping was my favorite position because it gave me the ability to handle unhappy customers, freedom to move around and monitor the front end, and I could work directly with money. Management was very different depending on the person working that day. Some are super helpful and some are not. The workplace culture feels like a second home because all the employees become very close to one another."
good,The safeway I work at needs a lot of work. Lots of theft. nothing gets fixed once it breaks. Hours are always back and forth. No one gets fired cause they need people badly.
good,"I learned a lot from Safeway such as how to deal with customers and meet their needs. I also learned lots about how a business works, and what makes it run. Management was always friendly but given that we were usually short staffed it was rather difficult for them to meet your needs, that was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part is being able to work with your coworkers and make an entire department look great in very little time and having the customers appreciate that. Also being able to be trusted with the department by yourself is a great sense of responsibility and great way for me to prove my worth, which I have been told I did time and time again. Overall I enjoyed my time at Safeway thoroughly and will miss it."
good,Can be very busy. epically on Fridays. And they are open every holiday. Can be a fun day when you have a good team. I did enjoy me time with this company but with the scheduling was better balanced.
good,"Good company, but no room for advancement. I learn a lot on the job and continuing education that will help me in jobs to come in the future. Just time for something new."
good,"i worked here for three years, it was a good experience but nearing the end of my employment there the company started losing its values and mistreating employee's. managers for the most part were good."
good,"Under -staffed, receiving is constantly full so I had to move pallets just to get my product into my cooler while doing manager duties alone for $9.50"
good,"Safeway provided stable hours however never provided the staff or tools needed to be completely successful. Benefits are good. Training in different aspects of the business were available and useful,"
good,"Management was very poor"
good,"The first week I was there I watched the person who was hired with me quit. Within the first month or two, the manager of 20 years was relocated to produce as a general employee. We didn't have an actual manager the rest of the time, just people ""filling in"" who didn't care if things got done. "
good,Good pay but no social life. long days with heavy lifting. I enjoyed working here except the 6-7 work day weeks got a bit overwhelming. I had to sacrifice a lot of my personal time to stay employed here.
good,Safeway doesn't really like to pay for the work that they want done. They write you up for staying later to complete you work and they write you up if its not completed. I like that Safeway taught me how to be able to prepare food for the customers as well as safety rules and health procedures. There is no room for growth in this business.
good,"Felt like basic entry level work. Wasn't something I was particularly interested in doing, and management didn't make up for lack of enthusiasm. Poor higher ups led to many problems around the work place. However, the environment and coworkers were all very nice and fun to be around."
good,"Typically bagged groceries daily, gathered carts, swept & cleaned store and helped other employees while greeting customers. Learned how grocery stores are organized. Management is mediocre at times. Hardest part of the job is gathering carts during busy hours and standing for long periods of times. Most enjoyable part of the job is lunch time where you have a great selection of foods to eat."
good,"The Customers were so Real kind and awesome I miss so If it were my choice to had changed all the rules id still be Employed  there I think that Company,s  Corporation Division was not aware of the behavior The upper Manager Quit Three or four weeks after Myself for same reasons"
good,"I worked in every department for about 4 years. ICC. Produce. Meat. Dairy. Liquor. Floral. Bakery. Day Stock. Night Stock. You name it, I did it. I'd work 32-48 hrs a week because sometimes OT was necessary to get the job done. Whatever it takes, I am a team player."
good,"During my time working for Safeway I observed the redundant, disrespectful conduct of a manager towards their departments' employees, that was reported repeatedly to higher management but the situation never improved, and drove away good workers. I also witnessed signs of favoritism being shown by a member of store management to an employee, such as getting more hours than senior members in the same department and taking extra breaks without any disciplinary action being taken."
good,"Safeway was a great company, but purchase by VC has jobs leaving Pleasanton, California."
good,Manager was mean but has since left. I swept floors and cleaned the bathrooms for very little money. In addition to this I cleaned up necessary aisles when there was a mess. I made minimum wage.
good,"The union didn't do anything for me when I got 'laid off' down to my lowest paying position, i would never recommend anyone work at Safeway/Vons - it was the worst."
good,I have only been working at Safeway.com for a short time but I already see some flaws. You never know when you have to report to work until that day when you get a text from dispatch. The time varies so much that its hard to make any plans outside of work.
good,I worked at safeway as a courtesy clerk if you don't like cleaning I wouldn't recommend the task. You start off at 7.25 so I would recommend this job for a teen. You just clean around the store bag groceries and collect carts outside. Not hard at all. The bakery was better because I got to work in the department by myself the independence made me want to work even harder because no one could distract me or tell me what to do. I didn't like how they still made the courtesy clerks get carts in the scorching sun or cold winter with no remorse. It's a good job if you're in school they understand your availability but will give you less hours not more just to save money.
good,It's a good place to work but management is not very organized. Schedules can also be on and off with hours. No set days off on many positions and call in and shift changes happen randomly
good,"Working there wasn't too bad and the staff was fun to work with. Management, however, was a pain to deal with, especially if you injure yourself. I had injured myself and instead of listening to my doctor's orders on allowing me to take time off, they put me on reduced hours and the alternate work they had me doing only made my injury worse. It was hard to alternate between customers and preparing food, but it was manageable most times. Not a lot of room to work and it was hard to get anything done in a single day."
good,"Although many managers were decent and quite good, many were quite bad and would verbally threaten the jobs of employees and show favoritism, and fair treatment, to those that sucked up to them. Further the corporate culture seemed to favor those managers for advancement. This often lead to other employees having to do more work and getting more of the blame if things went wrong."
good,"If you want to work irregular work hours and suffer through endless rude customers, then Safeway is the place for you. But they do have pretty good benefits if you are a full time employee"
good,Departments were kept clean and tidy at my store. They made it very easy to interact with customers. Great setup which always made you part of the customers interactions.
good,"Safeway is one of the easiest companies to get hired by, but that is because so many employees have quit. "
good,Competitive work environment. Looking for better quality .strive to meet the customer needs.always looking to make a better shopping experience for the customers.
good,"stressful work environment, not enough hours to go around, managers only cared for survey results and nothing else.  Paid minimum wage for most of my time there with minimal advancement in job title or pay scale.  I could personally run each department by myself, yet i made the same as the newest clerks."
good,"Not a bad place to work as a student - they manage working hours well between school and other possible jobs - I wouldn't choose to work at Safeway for a career for anything other than a last resort type of situation, though."
good,the job was great except for minimal hours. The store was going through the take over from sobeys and thus impacted employees hours after price drops.
good,I love my job at Safeway but I'm trying to find another happiness in my life which would have to be with kids I love them and great at taking care of any age
good,"In a typical day at work, you are always doing something and have at least 1 hour of carts. the management was not bad but the scheduling was poor. The other employees were nice, but don't talk much. The hardest part of the job was getting shifts."
good,"Safeway is a fast paced environment that pays minimum wage. Most people do not enjoy working there, however it is fairly easy to get a job with them. If your in desperate need they are a good route to take, just don't get stuck there."
good,"Safeway is an alright company to work for. Most of the people there are nice. But I was only being scheduled 6-9 hours a week, which I didn't know was legal."
good,I worked as a manager so work balance was not always the best most of my days off were handling calls and concerns. Management was great to work with except for the manager that choked me out at work needless to say he was fired and made it impossible for me to return to the job I enjoyed and was at for 10 straight years
good,"Irregular hours, always calling to ask employees to come in on their scheduled days off.  The hours vary greatly from week to week and unless you have a lot of seniority it is difficult to get enough hours to live on"
good,I feel like all stores are understaffed which makes it harder to do your designated job properly. If youre a manager forget about a life...you will be demanded to work crazy and unreasonable hours with seemingly no help.
good,"Safeway as a store needs a lot of work. Management is an issue. The store director has poor work ethic and management skills."
good,"I enjoy customer contact and trying to resolve their wishes, but I am very displeased with their hours, as I used to work almost 40 hours a week and now, at most, I work 12 due to major hours cut."
good,"Its simple to just come to work and click the buttons on the register, ask for thier club card and then clock out at the end of your shift"
good,Safeway is pretty average retail work.  Scheduling is flexible and you will meet some really cool people along the way.  Management is terrible across the board.  Good job for short term/students/transitioning.
good,"For the most part I enjoyed working here, however management is absolutely horrendous. The front end schedule had to be corrected on a near-weekly basis due to the store manager ignoring cashiers' availabilities when drafting it. From talking to coworkers I know almost every department has issues with the organization and management of the store. "
good,"Low pay, hours all over the place, not promoting from within probably will get pulled into the office for a write up for something stupid but other than that its decent"
good,Management is poor. Everyone is very nice but that doesn't make them qualified for the job. Health benefits are too expensive for that large of a company.
good,"Pretty quiet, Learned communication skills, management was decent, Co-workers were somewhat friendly. No hard part. All parts of that job was always fun"
good,"The management is bad, they don't remember anything you tell them about. The work environment isn't productive. They cut your hours from 26 to 8 every other week. The co workers are nice people, just not good work wise."
good,"A day at work depended on what was happening outside the store, you could either be completely swamped or so slow that everything got done on time."
good,"Constantly moving never just hanging around, always providing the best customer service was my first job ever so felt pretty great to work there."
good,The typical day at work for me is running around like a crazy person. When I work night shift I do not get my break because I am the only one working.
good,Probably need to do a review with the store manager about confidentiality and other things.  Most of the employees made it a fun place to work and we're always willing to help you out.
good,"Typical Day at Safeway is busy"
good,"Safeway was a fun place to work, but they only Scheduled everybody once a week. I made lots of friends and dealt with some grumpy people, thus expanding my customer service."
good,"i learnt how to multi-task, management skills and customer relation"
good,"One of the best jobs I had, the people and environment was awesome, the money and hours weren't bad at all in the beginning. Each month, my hours go shorter and shorter, and my manager didn't seem to care at all that I was having a hard time paying rent and living in general. my advice would to apply for full time, unless you live with your parents and don't mind working 4 hours a week."
good,"On shift I have to break down the order, then dispatch the order according to aisles where items go. Next, I will stock the items by ensuring a proper rotation."
good,"I learned how to communicate with a wide variety of people, cultures and individuals.  "
good,Fast paced never a dull moment. Great first job or even career there is always room for promotions and the search from within first. And the health care is pretty good.
good,"If you don't mind working for minimum wage and less than 40 hours per week, Safeway is not that bad of a place to work."
good,"Could be a good company if they paid more.. they need more management and a little more training to certain employees. They are too laid back, cleaning"
good,"While working at Safeway, I had a great day working with other co-workers. "
good,I worked there for over 8 months in the produce department and fresh cut department. I loved my job it was easy and enjoyable other than some of the people that worked there. I had no choice but to quit after months of an unprofessional work environment. I learned a lot on how to prepare items and what certain things are so i wouldn't change the experience for nothing.
good,Doing the same work every day is a boring routine. It was a monotonous and laborious job which does not need any creativity. Working hours were irregular.
good,"high expectations on daily basis cause stressful working enviornments, safeways labor model makes it difficult to achieve goals, need to take a page out of king soopers labor model."
good,"Fun and diverse place to work at. Only downfall is that we are union and have to to fight to get fair contracts and health benefits. Raises are very minimal and only like .10c per year, if that. No way you can live off .10c raises that happen only once every 3-4 years."
good,"It was a few block from the beach. The store helped me learn different positions in a store like that. I was first a bagger, then moved to the meat department, then to Cashier, then lastly a bookkeeper and a bakery person. I had many coworkers help me out to learn and grow. "
good,"A typical day at work would look like bagging groceries, Helping people out to their car, Taking out trash aroud 8 p.m , Sweeping the store hourly, Being helpful to the use of a customer, getting along with everyone."
good,"Safeway is a good place to work. It is not for the faint of heart you have to work really hard and do alot of work (which there's nothing wrong with) , but some people struggle because there is a lot of work to do or is expected and usually not a lot of either staff or hours."
good,"I happily dealt with customers, concerns with the best of my abilities. I packed groceries & scanned them. My co-workers were vastly approachable & supportive of each other. I enhanced my customers service skills & I also learnt how to work under pressure."
good,Overall it was a great experience but the management wasn't great. My co-workers and the customers were very wonderful making it an enjoyable time. I normally worked late hours not getting out tell 10 or 11 at night.
good,"typical day "
good,"Operate electronic scanning cash register to total customers’ final bill. "
good,"gained a lot of knowledge about making all the starbucks drinks however, did not get the benefits of other starbucks employees since it was a kiosk starbucks ran through vons"
good,"it is an good first job, but no advancement can be achieve unless you which departments. Also a lot of ways to learn about safety and OSHA standards."
good,"it was okay, most customers were nice and co-workers nice most of the time. not too hard of work.  a typical day at work was to get ready and serve customers for up to 20 hours a week."
good,Great job for someone looking to start out at the bottom and stay forever. If you put in the time you can quickly work towards promotions and raises.
good,There is plenty of opportunities to advance as there are many different departments with different shift leads. The pay is minimum wage until you've been there for 4 years. There are many different positions in the store so you will never become bored. I liked interacting with customers and working in the produce department. My co-workers were very nice people and I got along with all of them and even developed some friendships.
good,"Management expectations change without warning.  Work schedules are weekly, requested time off is not guaranteed and likely to be scheduled during requested time off.  Can be scheduled 6 days at 4 to 6 hr shifts to equal less than 30 hrs for the week.  Includes overnight stocking shifts with day shifts without 8 hrs between shifts."
good,Great employees.co-workers. Management/Corporate does not seem to fathom the expectations put upon the employees.
good,"It's a good starter job; they work with your school schedule and if you are a student they don't require you to work full time. However, I wouldn't suggest that one tries to make a living by being a Deli Employee for the rest of their lives. The pay is low and it takes a long time to get the max pay which is under fifteen dollars an hour."
good,"Safeway, while not the top notch place to work, was still a great experience. The co-workers and customer's were friendly. I enjoyed my time there and would recommend as a first job."
good,"The job seems okay but it lacks hours and pay. Hours are to inconsistent and leaves room for improvement. In the meanwhile though the staff is awesome, the managers are pretty on point when it comes to how the store is ran and their willing to help you when needed."
good,"A typical day working for Safeway is interesting to say the least. Every person I work with, including management, are lenient with expectations. As a Safeway deli clerk, you learn how to put on a smile for any customer (Including upset customers)."
good,"Very busy store, never a dull moment, always multitasking with customer and employee needs. Management is good, not great. Co-workers are fun to work with every shift."
good,Had awesome co-workers that made the shifts fun and also allow for time to pass quickly. I learned excellent time management skills and customer service etiquette. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers. They were very personable and nice when I first started and taught me some techniques and tips about the job.
good,"	Responsible for standard customer throughout the store."
good,"Work everyday over 12 hours 5, 6 sometimes 7 days a week, I learned more about union to employee to management skills, work with a strong management team, I am a very strong part of the leadership in my store, district and company, never have I ever had a problem with an employee, I am the trusted leader at every store I been at and I am a very strong communicator and motivator as well."
good,"I came into this job thinking that the grocery business was a great business to get into.  I did not know about the union rules that make every promotion and advancement based on seniority rather than on the work ethic and skills of the people working there.  It is very easy to get held down in a very low paying position($9), with no hope for getting promoted unless you stay there for years.  As time goes on, the union keeps coming out with worse contracts that do not help the hard workers.  The job itself is easy, but there is a lot of never-ending pressure to be quicker, almost as if they expect you to somehow become a second person so you can get more work done.  I would love this job if it was possible to just get promoted because I am a good person for a higher up job."
good,"Busy. Always kept the time going. They were flexable. Lovely ladies and gentlemen that work there."
good,"It was actually very nice working for the company before they changed store managers. Before that, it was a very welcoming place to work where everyone did not feel pressured or on edge and could talk to management when they felt the need to."
good,There is very little explanation for newer guys who start working in the meat department. The work environment starts getting fun because time fly's by when you start to understand job requirements.
good,"this job was great in customer service and retail skills. A typical day was just basic cashiering, and helping customers with anything they needed. My co-workers were all great and most everyone got along with everyone very well. Management was always around early or late that was nice, they were always setting up new things around the store and coming up with new ideas. Hardest part of the job was dealing with certain customers but the best part was also the customers. Some were awesome and would come in regular and made my day so much better, but yet the difficult people taught me things, and made me a better problem solver. I liked this job because I like a fast pace environment, and I like working with the public."
good,"Its a changing environment.  They are working through the processes as they combine the two companies."
good,it was very rough being alone in such a busy environment . it was a nice job just wish they would start there workers off at 10.25 an hour
good,"Worked for the company for 9 years, at multiple locations, every store is the same, your lucky if you get a awesome store manager, some are ridiculous and make life and work her. I was always given chances to move up but then never given the proper compensation. I was promised many thing that never happened, taken advantage of by stepping up a manager and never being recognized or paid correctly for my hard work, there's union contract rules and Safeway contract rules that don't co work with each other unforunatley"
good,"Could not provide workers in my department with enough hours, My Co-workers always put off a stressed and not friendly vibe"
good,"Working within deli departments, you must shift from serving hot food, to making sandwiches, to slicing meats and cheeses, working cash registers, while washing your hands between each task and serving customers in the proper order of arrival. Once you get the procedures down, this type of work is actually very easy going and enjoyable. At the same time, you are not likely to advance much in pay within the Safeway Deli because the Union contract is of much poorer quality than that of the meat or grocery department."
good,I enjoyed working here. The staff was friendly and helpful. Management however was very unprofessional. At times I would overhear management insulting staff members.
good,"If you are worth anything as a Manager, expect to get moved around to various locations (often).  Expect to be moved to locations within a 50 mile one way commute.  "
good,A typical day would entail communications with vendors and category management on working together to ensuring products are coming in on time to meet promotional deadlines. The overall cultural environment is a well mixed group of individuals with diverse backgrounds and knowledge.
good,"Overall it was okay work. I was paid for my time but that is where it started to get bad. The schedule would drastically change so much that I couldn't plan anything outside of work ahead of time. The management was very rude and not polite at all, and didn't seem to care about the employees or the workplace."
good,"Best part of the job were my co-workers, on all shifts. The area most lacking was communication on any and all levels. Okay as a starter in a call center."
good,"Working at Safeway was a good learning experience. Learning to work with different families . The store would have customers whom shopped daily, they we're used to the employees and we became used to them!"
good,very productive environment. But they did not work around school schedules. very good coworkers to work with and great attitude conducted by management
good,"overall good place to work, very face paced, everyday is the same you pick items after items. after time it becomes second nature and then becomes easier. management is management that's all Ill say, co workers are definitely a mixed bunch but found some good friends. hardest part of the job is hitting production when time for assignments is tweaked and not obtainable. the paycheck is the best part, you get paid for what you do"
good,Safeway is an okay job for an after school thing but as a career I would not recommend it. They start out with minimum wage. Which was about $7.60 when I joined. You can get a ten cent raise every 3 months I believe. I was happy there for a little while but it was too far from where I lived. I wasn't happy traveling 2 hours plus everyday for a little $170 paycheck every week.
good,"The store I was at particularly was not the best. I cannot judge the company as a whole based upon my experience in that one store. In fact, I spent a week at a different store and loved my job. It all comes down to management. There was a lot of favoritism flying around that particular work place, so I really don't have an accurate judgement on the corporation as a whole. For the most part I enjoyed what I did. I'd come in, and get straight to work doing whatever it was I had to do that day. Mostly re-stocking. I honestly enjoyed the hard work, the labor, the sweat. It made me feel like I was actually accomplishing something. The one thing that typically derailed my day was the lack of inter department cooperation (again, this is based solely off of my particular store). It really just made everyone's job harder. But all in all, it was a decent place to work. There were hours available for those that wanted them and the benefits were nice once you put your time in. I don't know if I would recommend the company as a solid career choice, but it was a good first job experience for me personally."
good,"fast paced job but wish it was easier to advance and wish it had better pay, i learned to move a a fast pace and to multitask better, management is to be desired it can feel like they are not around at times, co-workers seemed nice, the hardest part of the job is knowing that you are working for peanuts, the best part of the day is when you help a client out and they are actually happy."
good,"cashing. making floral arrangements, oasis and vase and wet wraps. taking daily orders. helping customers with picking items to purchase. watering plants and cleaning them. the most fun part is making arrangements when we have the time. hardest part are on the holidays. so much work to be done and numerous customers to deal with."
good,Working for the Safeway warehouse is financially rewarding but that's all. There is no work schedule which means you have to call in every morning to see if you're going to work that day. If you're lucky you might get a schedule after seven to ten years. You will make a lot of money but will have no life.
good,strong team communication skills are a must in order to complete your job each night. Vendors play an important role in the stores availability and knowledge of various products. working closely with other co-workers to insure each member has faced the store each morning ready for business.
good,"Safeway has some very good employees. The only issue is that the company as a whole, is that information is Stove piped. Left does not know what the right hand is doing."
good,"40 hours week"
good,"No team work, very little hours to get job done, zero communication On the plus side flexible scedule and paid vacatios."
good,"nothing at this time, due to the acquisition by Cerebus. Will have to wait another 12 months to see the changes. Not much else to say"
good,"Operating on a regular day or weekly schedule, a delivery truck driver’s day typically involves loading and unloading cargo, dropping off a small or large amount of groceries to customers, handling paperwork (like receipts or delivery confirmations) and reporting any suspicious roadside activity they may encounter. Follow out planned routes, which offers some flexibility."
good,I've worked here since I was 16. The great things I learned from Safeway has been how to be more outgoing as well as work with teams better. Working in a produce department requires a lot of teamwork and structure to successfully run the department.
good,"i loved going to work, i get along with most everyone, the only hardest part of my job was standing all day,the most enjoyable part was seeing the same customers coming through my till, and we would carry on our conversation where we had left off from the last visit.i learned alot knowing all the codes for the friut and vegetables was a big one, knowing them, makes the job so much easier,"
good,"A typical day at work was extremely fast paced and stressful. Not enough help and too much to get done. On the other hand I learned how to handle those things and succeed, which will help me greatly in the future. I learned alot of management skills as well as customer service. The management here wasn't the greatest, they pile way too much on their workers and expect too much. My coworkers here were great though, always trying their hardest and just fun people to be around, we all kept eachother motivated. The hardest part of this job was being under paid and having to do very stressful work all of the time. The most enjoyable part of this job was cooking and being responsible for myself and others. I felt very important leading my crew by example."
good,"working at safeway, it taught me multiple skills that I didn't already know, its a great first time job to have"
good,A very fast paced job. Learned to multi tasked and gained customer service skills that is essential to my future employments. Co-workers are friendly and nice. Teamwork is fantastic.
good,"Safeway deli was very educational. the hardest part was trying to do your job properly but also doing it fast, because we get a lot of customers I had to learn fast on what I should do when left on my own and when with a or coworker. I loved working there, it kept my mind always working hahaha."
good,Worked at Safeway while attending college. Low pay and little job security. You're typical part time job.
good,"Working here was troublesome. In a strong union environment, front line supervisors were worked extra hard with very little support. Company promoted a very political environment which distracted from any team building attempts. they do pay extremely well though."
good,"Just your average minimum, fresh out of high school job. Help bag groceries, carry them out, clean, do some stocking, round up carts."
good,"They really give you a hard time about your rate of order picking, but it can get boring quickly. Riding the power jacks is fun but dangerous. They sometimes give you overtime which pays well. Other staff are nice. Equipment that they give you makes work easy. Dress code is relaxed. It's a good job if you can work fast enough and not knock over your loads."
good,"learned how to deal with customers the right way, but management is really disrespecful and not considerate about their employees and really hard to get a promotion."
good,"On a general day as soon as you clock into work you relieve someone who is in a check stand for either a break or there lunch. Their are constantly people wanting to check out so you rarely leave the check stand unless it is time for lunch or break which is mongered by the supervisor. Management differs from store to store but they are generally uneducated and lack motivation to help the store succeed. Most of the people who work for Safeway are either college kids or people who didn't go to college and couldn't get another job. However, most of the employees are very nice people and become your family while you work there."
good,Typical corporate environment that requires involvement in Union.
good,"A lot of managment turnover ,good co workers ,great union not very appreiciative of hard work"
good,"Easy to learn"
good,i worked for this company for 6 years and its a great place to build your character but not to build your life upon.
good,"Great for a first time job while going to school, but if you are wanting to get anywhere through the company it was very hard,"
good,i had a seizure and spent time in the hospital and the a flu and was told not to come in by one manager and the other manager told me to get a drs note which i did and she then said i violated probation by not showing up so i was terminated. communication is awful.
good,I was very lucky to work at Safeway during my college years.  Through the management I worked for I learned skills that I have continued to use my entire career.
good,dealt w/vendors and stores as main customer interaction making job easier than working w/general public
good,"difficult to get along with some of the management, more often than not I ended up being the scape-goat."
good,Have to be quick on your toes and learn quickly. Management is caring when it comes to employees time requested off.
good,Hard to move up and the business is built around those who are willing to put family second or third.
good,24yrs with the company taught me a great deal. Growing up with co-workers
good,Clock in work and go home. I did get along with my co-workers and the management was ok. The hardest part of the job is not paying well. There was nothing enjoyable other than my co-workers and friends at work.
good,"I Dealt with alot of customers and learned something new everyday from the job as a checker/cashier, everything was electronic but i caught on very fast, i got along with everyone at work very easy going person, the hardest part of the job was nothing really I Just enjoyed working with the public and learning something new everyday, I was a very hard worker."
good,"walking around making the store is clean an organized and making sure the customers have an enjoyable expierence and collecting carts and doing the bottle return"
good,"A typical work day consisted of making sure the shelves were stocked, packaging and labeling products, making sandwiches to order, and checking inventory.  This position helped me learn the processes required to run a deli and bakery.  Despite being a clerk, I developed management skills and was often given the task of training new employees.  My co-workers required a lot of motivation and constant supervision, but with training most became team players.  This position helped me understand the importance of keeping your employees happy in order to promote productivity and better customer service."
good,Everyday consist of gathering the shopping carts. Returning unwanted products to their shelves. assisting costumers with finding different products. The hardest part of the job was having o work with lazy co-workers and alone on various occasions.
good,  I got to learn and expand my knowledge and pass on information to lead an APC to being promoted to a meat cutter then to a manager.
good,I enjoyed my other barista co-workers and liked my supervisor.  I hated the store management.  Nothing was even taken care of.  A lot of fraternization and obscene things going on in that store.  Was really sick of it and left.
good,"Make sandwiches all day. My co-workers were always doing there own job and didnt really worry about others duties. Management was never really around most of the time, I never usually went to management for questions. The most enjoyable part of the day was having conversations with customers while I made their food."
good,not a good place if you want full time especially in winter time
good,Safeway's infrastructure needs upgrades (old buildings)
good,I worked in both the bakery department and meat/seafood department.
good,I enjoyed my job. I enjoyed dealing with customers. Job conflicted with my school schedule and so I had to quit once I started going.
good,"The Safeway store that I worked for in Alaska built me to be the person I am today. They were kind, generous, they helped me strive and move up in the workplace. However, transferring to Denver division. I've been very disappointed. Management was NOT friendly. I was told I was coming into a certain pay rate but am making $4/hr. less then what was discussed. Now Im on a probation period. Which I understand, but was not explained to especially about hourly pay being affected. My vacation was not transferred over, I had to call and fix it. I called HR a few times with concerns, and NO ONE got back to me. The transfer alone was by far stressful. But with no help from the stores I was transferring to made it way more difficult. I saw myself moving up and possibly going through store management for this store. But the way I been treated in the two weeks of being here, I don't feel like this is the place for me anymore. Which I am sad, because I had amazing leaders at my previous store. Now, I ask myself everyday, how are these people managers? No customer service, did not show me around, introduce me to other employees, I felt out casted the day I got here! Not a place you want to be when you spend most of your days at work."
good,The job was very straight foward. It was the same task everyday with little to no difference between days. To me it didn't appear that they cared too much about thier employees well being or wadge.
good,"A very great place to work to grow and develope wonderful relationships with coworkers and customers. Typical day consists of constant interaction with customers, whether that be when bagging groceries, collecting carts, or sweeping the aisles, there's never a dull moment and you always have an opportunity to serve the customer. I learned how to appease a customer and make their day a little brighter by being friendly and courteous. The hardest part about this job is managing the time clock sweeps with collection of carts, as well as the demand of customers and checkers needing assistance. It's a very time-management oriented job, and you are constantly moving. The most enjoyable part is being able to assist customers with simple and big things a like, and at the end of the day, knowing you helped someone that needed the help, and possibly even a laugh or two!"
good,Safeway in Oregon likes to advance people but in Washington they dont like outsiders.
good,The hardest part of my job was there was a lot to do and I could barely get it finished in allowed time.
good,Great job while in college. Night stocking allowed me to balance studies with employment.
good,"Customer satisfaction is a daily task. I honestly didn't learn anything new from working there besides security measures to ensure proper money handling and how to spot fraudulent behavior. The management always seemed to do only what was expected of them from their supervisors, not paying any mind to the employees. My co-workers were hard workers just like me with many different backgrounds. Most of which had worked there for four years and more. The hardest part of the job for me was to pretend not to be a cheery person at the check stand and to pick up more than 20 pounds because I am a small framed person. It was also hard picking up slack from a few co-workers that did not do their jobs. The most enjoyable part was helping customers and watching them leave happy with my help."
good,I worked behind the Deli counter slicing meats and cheeses for customers and then I did clean up work. Clean up work was the hardest part of the job
good,i learned how to use knifes and cutting blades and the safety of foods
good,Advancement was available and encouraged. Compensation was decent but not always up to par when compared to other companies. management at the time of employment was slightly unprofessional. 1st and 2nd assistants competed for employee approval and attention and would often engage in gossip and favoritism.
good,"It wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was simply a place to go to and spend time stocking shelves in return for money."
good,Very concerned about advancement.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of preparing the deli case, breaking down the daily delivery and stocking items, usually the days were chaotic with everything that needed doing."
good,"I was responsible for customer service, slicing bread, stocking shelves and closing down the bakery front end."
good,"Been here for over five years. Luckily, I have had awesome department managers who make it as fun as possible to be in retail. Customers are mostly nice and appreciate your hard work, because nobody else will. Once you're here long enough, and you start to make decent money, it's hard to leave...mainly because the jobs out there won't pay anything similar...nor will you have a union to back you up (if you work in a unionized department like I do Yes, they have actually helped me)."
good,I enjoyed working here due to there high customer service I didnt like the fact i worked there for 6 months was promoted to bookkeeper but was only given a .10 raise to do the bookkeeper position which is handling all cash for entire store I feel this is only a 1 person job and has over 30 procedures to do daily i believe they need to increase payment for bookkeepers to at least 10.00 an hour starting
good,"The work day varies depending upon your shifts, which can and do change on a weekly basis. It is not unusual to leave at 7pm, and then have to be back some ten hours later for 5am."
good,Great people to work with
good,"For the most part, Safeway is ok. The one I work at basically makes your life a pain in so many ways. Management lately has sucked and there are no hours and even though there are no hours they still try to send people home early. We aren't appropriately staffed and a lot of the employees mess around a lot."
good,"Every day was different because you never had a set schedule so your hours varied, you'd work full time hours one week and part time hours the next."
good,A great company to learn the ins and outs of customer service.
good,If you are a hard worker and organized then Safeway is the company for you. Many obstacles to go through but with a high sese of urgency and drive anyhing is possbile with this company. Hardest part of the job is work/life balance
good,"working at fed ex was an easy job making sure the product were sent to the right place, making sure the labels were correct co-workers were cool outgoing people the hardest part was not getting enough hours and the most enjoyable part was getting an opportunity to move around in the company!"
good,Very beneficial for a young age. The union isn't very useful. I advanced my career quickly by being extremely useful.
good,"When I first started at Safeway, in 2004, it was a great company to work for. Compensation was great and you were made to feel like you were needed. As the economy began to take a dive, somewhat understandable, Safeway quickly became a very lousy work place. Not only did the amount of help drop to virtually none, but suddenly each person left did not do enough. As a company, Safeway seems to be taking advantage of the current economic environment."
good,· Developing and reviewing weekly sales plans
good,A great management and has a good treatment mostly for the foreign workers like me.
good,"My experience at Safeway was excellent; however, I was laid off due to cost cutting. My co-workers were welcoming, supportive, and patient with me. The hardest part was learning to memorize the codes in the computer systems. The most enjoyable part of the job is filling prescriptions, counting medications, and do inventory."
good,"worked nights for 10pm to 7am. never saw my family. my co-workers were all great, was not into the job anymore not enough income to support my family."
good,"They are big on customer service, but they don't care much for the employees."
good,"I enjoyed working at Safeway for the time I did. I had fun, friendly coworkers and we recieved some of the best customers. I found that Safeway takes its customer service more seriously than other grocery stores I visit."
good,"Exciting and a faced paced work environment. I had to keep the parking lots clean,stocking grocerys,bagging,and help coustmers with their bags."
good,The job was something thatbwa not meant for me. I had a lot of things to do at that job. The hours was not flexible when I wasn't playing sports. It's hard to get different hours.
good,Depending on your job title will judge your day to day work flow. always a busy job environment . working with lots of customers and merchandise. its a good starter job for teens .
good,They let me have my hours I want.but they also tell you one thing is okay while another manager will yell at you for the same thing the other manager just told you to do.
good,"It is often fast paced work, and the management is decent and fairly respectful. The starting pay is often very low, like minimum wage low. The coworkers however are decent to work with."
good,"Took first job I could find. Enjoyed the job at first, but got discouraged after they moved me to another position without talking to me. I lived to far away for this to be a good fit for me. But they helped me and I thank them for that."
good,"Safeway company is a great experience  for me to enter the canadian job market &an introduction to learning  canadian culture  and labor laws ,my coworkers are really kind and helpful,also I have the chance  to improve my english language,to summarize safeway is an opportunity to work in a good enviroment full of personal and career growth opportunities."
good,Working at Safeway was decent at first but they had me doing the same repetitive process constantly. I let the company know before I was hired that I would be missing a week for my fathers wedding in Mexico. Unfortunately afterwards when I got home I wasn’t feeling well so I went to the doctor and found out I had Ecoli and had to be put on antibiotics. My doctor gave me a note for work saying that I needed a week to recover. When I came back the store manager called me to his office and said that  the note only covered for 1 day and that I was fired. I honestly was going to quit anyways cause I was moving to Texas that month to go to college.
good,This company is great for young adults just getting out of high school or even college that aren't sure exactly what they want to do with the their life
good,"Introductory training needs some work.  Tasks were simple enough, but coordination and timing was jerky and competetiveness between old and new employees was evident... they are pretty good to work for but they don't emphasize team work in training"
good,"While working at Safeway, I got a shoulder injury and had to file a claim. A year later, I'm still injured. I had to take leave to try recovering after managers and coworkers got very toxic about my inability to do most things. I had a manager tell me, point-blank, I had to come collect carts even though it was listed I couldn't collect carts in my doctor note. This was a week after being hospitalized for my shoulder injury. Needless to say, I won't be working for Safeway anymore. Without an injury, they're not too bad. It's just a matter of working yourself to the point of wanting to collapse at the end of every shift."
good,The culture was great and most of the people i worked with were very polite and cheerful. The only downside was the scheduling was very inconsistent and more often than not requests for certain times off were ignored.
good,"there were some days that the work hours were so long that i had to sleep in my car to avoid going home and coming back."
good,"Is a good job, but the employees with more time working there feeling like they are the boss, they don’t respect you and the managers don’t do nothing."
good,A typical day was to be on the registrar and begin ringing up customers. Learned how to run a registrar and bag groceries and pricing.The Manager that was in charge was never available and seemed to always be stressed out. (He is no longer there) Otherwise the other people were great. The Customer service agents had poor customer service skills and were not too nice. The workplace culture was not very inclusive of other new people. The hardest part was having a non-supportive manager. The most enjoyable was that most of the team members had good spirit and were fun to work with.
good,"Safeway is a nice place to work at. Typically there is usually a lot one has to do at the store and depending on which department you work in. I have learned to deal with all sorts of customers with the request they have as well as questions they ask. The most enjoyable part of working there is the interactions with the customers because you tend to meet many different people from all walks of life, same with coworkers you end up working with a lot of different people with different backgrounds and you tend to come together and help each other out."
good,I’ve been here for 20+ years and I don’t think we get paid for what we do. I do love my job and I take pride in what I do. They have provided for my family
good,"Safeway is the job that demands the most production with the least amount of time possible. Staffing is constantly an issue, and even when understaffed the production is expected to remain the same."
good,While working at Safeway I came across and meet some great customers that came back to see me at the Starbucks department whenever they wanted their drinks made with great services. The customers that comes back whenever they're doing their shopping have grown to have a great relationship as their Barista when I can call them by their name and also know what they would want to drink.
good,"I worked at Safeway for a summer because they didn't have enough employees in the small town I lived in. They offered an hourly higher than what I was being paid at my other part time job, so I joined on. There are plenty of job advancement opportunities for anyone who is willing to stick with their job and work hard."
good,Great job 1st job. Entry level to customer service. The job is very fast paced. The day seems to fly by. The management is very concern about sales causing them to push you more.
good,"It’s a good starter job, or if you intend to move up, they pay well the higher you go. But at the cost of long hours and stress filled days. "
good,"I have been with Safeway for five years. I would consider myself an above-average employee and have only been promoted once. I have heard multiple times about people not getting promotions or raises they were promised by management. My store is in a nicer area so customers are usually nice and pleasant to deal with. I like almost every person I work with too. You will not get paid much above minimum wage regardless of when you started. However, it is a better environment than fast food. Health benefits are available. Do not count on competitive pay as advertised by the company, it is not true. I would say if you do your job well you will get hours. Schedules change a lot though."
good,"Management would constantly change the schedule only a day or two before a shift you were working, they would say the schedule said one thing when it clearly didn't or they would change it without you knowing so you wouldn't show up for a shift you didn't have and then they would get upset at you, they also put you on different jobs that you don't usually do and have no training with without telling you or asking you. this was my experience at Safeway, but overall it wasn't terrible in the beginning, it just definitely went downhill in my time there and i know i wasn't the only one who wasn't happy with the way things were going."
good,"lots of work and not enough time to get it all done. in the deli you make sandwiches, salads, do freight, cook, dishes and anything else that needs done.  Great team of workers in the deli and everyone gets along good."
good,"You have to be flexible. The team can be helpful, but everyone is stressed due to the demands of upper management. Hours/pay is unfair and inconsistent."
good,"Good to place to work straight out of high school. Provide complete flexibility for students. Not much room for advancement."
good,"A work day in the Safeway deli is very hectic, fast paced and stressful. You have very long lists of things to be done and almost never enough people to make sure all the customers are served and all the work gets done. Before I quit the manager told everyone hours were going to be cut because sales were not high enough however all that's going to do is tank sales ever further because no one will be able to serve customers. Unless production doesn't have to be done during the day, which they will still expect it to be done. Needless to say I am very glad I got out of there when I did. Equipment also took forever to be fixed, we only had one oven for months and were still expected to cook long lists of cold product and keep the hot case full all day which was nearly impossible on busier days. We also had no thermalizer which we needed to heat up the bags of soup for the hot soup station so we had to use the oven (even when the steam function on our only working oven stopped working properly which lead to the bags melting.. which really did not sit well with me and was actually one of the last things that lead me to quit, however that's what we were told to do). Needless to say, this place is a disaster. I got all the work done every day but the conditions and equipment I was supplied with were nowhere near what I needed to do it properly. I really do hope they get the department back on track because I spent over a year there and want to see that place succeed. The best part of the job is probably the people I got to work with. There was some drama sometimes but the vast majority"
good,I enjoyed working here but their expectations are too high for a person like me. I got my hours cut when i tried to get a second job. At the time minimum wage was only $12. I felt treated unfairly. Although i learned alot from that job and did enjoy the customers.
good,Ok job but only part time available. This job doesn't offer full time so they won't have to pay full benefits. Small discounts on Safeway brands and gas.
good,"Working here overall isn't too bad. Fast paced environment for the most part, got pretty good hours, health benefits, paid vacations. etc. Sometimes the management is not easy to communicate with."
good,"This job was a good first job for somebody just starting out in their in their career trying to figure out what they wanted to do. Management was sort of understanding with schedules that needed to be met, but didn't always work with people that needed certain schedules."
good,"The job paid minimum wage but typically would not give employees adequate hours per week, even to those with permanent positions. Often understaffed, but friendly coworkers and you receive some discounts when shopping at the store."
good,A good high school or fresh out of high school job but not somewhere long term. Very hard to move up and be promoted. Fast pace and involved with customers often.
good,Whenever I got this job they offered me weekly pay. That wasn't the case for the Vons I worked at. The managers were always too busy to give me my check for that week. Working at Vons taught me that you need to be pushy so that people will listen.
good,"although Safeway can be stressful at times, in the end, if you know how to separate yourself from your work environment, the benefits and fellow employees make it worth it."
good,"Management was very nice but lazy in getting things accomplished. Store directors did not allocate night crew extra people or hours, due to shortages. They expected 2-3 people to do the job on 4-5 in the same time or less. Many of us worked 6 days per week and up to 11-hour shifts. If we tried to call out sick we were guilted into coming in. Senior employees in my position would frequently leave work unfinished for me to do because they ""felt"" like going home and used arriving 30 minutes before me as their excuse."
good,"As long as there is a culture that cares only about the bottom line being bigger than the previous year.  This creates a situation where every year large corporations want more done with less hours. This creates a loss in both quality and customer service ability.  This is why companies like Vons will continue to lose revenue while companies like Starbucks, who spoil their employees, will always have a higher profit margin.  That being said, Vons is a union position, and comes with great benefits. Also the schedules are somewhat flexible during the week.  You will work almost every weekend."
good,"You learn the basics of having a job and the value of it while working here. You have direct public contact and you interact with a wide range of people. Management constantly changes and each manager has differing levels of experience. Some are great, others are still learning the ropes. At this job I learned how to maintain professional relationships. The hardest part of the job is difficult customers. The most enjoyable part of of the job is working with so many different people."
good,The assistant manager & the other manager I had a problem with.The assistant manager would nag me about wearing a hoodie in the morning when it’s cold. He wouldn’t take me seriously about school hours during the holidays. The other manager give me a warning paper just because I listen to my bakery manger instructions instead of hers.
good,Need to play the politics game. Your work doesn’t really show much when it comes to who you know and how you are able to please the person to move up. Doesn’t matter how hard or good you work it just matters how good you can please the person above you.
good,"I understand they are just trying to run a business, but the Vons just off of Broad has unfair leadership and the Union being a requirement kind of sucked. All in all, the working was alright, but they treated me like garbage."
good,The managment there was really stressful and strict. One of the managers didnt let you talk to the rest of the employees. Another manager was really mean and he would verbally abused me telling me the was lazy and would yell at me in front of costumers.
good,"I learned a great deal of managing a pharmacy although due to lack of enough support from upper management, the experience was difficult. I also learned and experienced a lot customer service skills."
good,"Hard work for courtesy’s, no one really respects you. You hardly get any hours. Some days are better then others, management is better then some jobs."
good,place can be good or bad. depends on your manager. job is easy i would only recommend this to someone going to school just need like little cash to get by .
good,This is a food starting job however if you are just starting they will most likely only work you 8 hour shifts on the weekends. They have to give you 16 hours per week minimum so it will usually be both Saturday and Sunday
good,"nice air conditioned place  where you are expected to       work constantly...no place to  sit except 'on break',,,nobody sits,  not even the GM....coworkers are nice, but love to    gossip"
good,"the company does not provide you with sufficient help to extend both quality work and great customer service. Employees are not fully trained in one department before they are sent (untrained) to another department, even when the employee is unwilling to go. There is no reward for hard working, loyal employees, or discipline for the ones just barely getting by. In either case, they both just get  a check."
good,"No communication, the work was straightforward but excessive, constantly dealing with the schedule being rewritten without notice. The work itself was fine, and having a union made things better for the most part."
good,"I worked for Safeway in Flagstaff, directly across from NAU. it was great, I only have memory of one bad customer the whole time i worked there, and she was angry over something I had no control over. 90% of the customers were about my age, so I was very comfortable the majority of the time. If they offered me more pay, I'd debate going back to them."
good,"Hours were constantly changed, they said their hours were dispersed between everyone depending on who worked their longest, those who just started getting fewer hours but that's not always how it worked."
good,"Can be a stressful job, and be more helpful if management worked with their employees. Had great co-workers who helped each other out. At the time I worked there they were hiring for part time only"
good,"I start off my day by making fried chicken, slicing meat, making sandwiches and then clean up by the end of the night. Ive also learned many new things on how to use the meat slicer and not only that but on how to fry and season chicken but thats technically all I learned frankly. Management on a RARE occasion would be really happy but most of the time they just stay angry or just not having a good day in general, they don't care about their workers and even if they try to its already too late.  the schedule was always random, and even when asking for requested days off they would never give it to us and us co-workers would have to find a way to see if they would like to exchange hours for the day off. The hardest part of the job was to handle with all the customers requests but once we all got through that then everything goes smooth sailing and the most enjoyable part of the job was without a doubt clocking out, just a sigh of relief knowing that its all over. "
good,"Overall a great job to have in college. Flexible, okay pay and some career advancement. A typical work day would can be pretty stressful and fast pace, but it would make the day go by quick."
good,"The day starts as soon as one clocks in & walks in the room in -while working issues to best resolve customer issues."
good,"My work days are either slow or fast paced. I learned to deal with extremely difficult situations, and a small workforce for in a busy environment. The hardest part of my job was when coworkers went for each others throats and made it extremely hard to work as a team."
good,"my typical day at work is like working at the register or self check out for 4-8 hours. I have learned how to count money fast and efficiently, check with little error. management changes too often to really know how it is."
good,"I rarely had the opportunity to work with a coherently focused team of individuals. As much as I asked despite the time I worked and tried to advance there, cross-training wasn't something they would offer because ""They did not have enough people trained well enough for me to leave""."
good,"a typical day would be coming in taking out garbage, doing whats on the production list, serving customers hot food, slicing deli meats, serving salad, wiping windows, counters, and doing dishes while following foodsafe guidlines. i made a lot of friends which made a good team to work around everyday."
good,"Mangers were not properly trained in osha safety guidlines. And did not know how to treat employees fairly. This is a sign of poor management training and skills, probably cost the store thousands a year in retraining cost because of employee turn over."
good,"Worked with food production, handling money and the environment was an easy paced environment and easy tasks such as checking dates and times of foods."
good,"The company doesn't expect much out of most employees. Employees are generally expected to do only one thing, and that follows into some management positions as well. Checkers are only expected to run a register. Customer service employees are only expected to work the customer service desk. There is a specialized department for store signage which isn't expected to know or be able to do much outside of that role. Employees whom are willing and able to take on multiple roles are few and far in between. There is very little emphasis put into quality of life for the employees. For example, the weekly schedule is posted only two days before the work week starts, making it difficult to plan things in life such as babysitters, school, second jobs etc. The retirement benefits are good, but the work doesn't provide much inspiration to stay for the duration of a career. The most difficult part of the job is working to the very specific and mediocre standards of work enforced by corporate with little freedom to solve problems in more efficient or effective ways. The most enjoyable part of the job is that despite the lack of communication and teamwork across departments, there remains a good camaraderie among employees. Everyone is generally respectful and polite."
good,"For hard working, honest employees.  A lot of training and most of it is hands on.  If you can learn great on your own you will be fine.  Manager makes same as Journey man."
good,"It is a fast paced environment, to get the groceries to the store.  They work on an old system so it will take getting used to."
good,To work at Safeway and keep the job you have to be quick and good at what you do. Attention to detail and good customer service is a must.  You might have to step outside your comfort zone and lead a different job. In the 2 years I was there I was in 3 different positions.
good,"It was a decent job, decent pay(primarily because Montgomery county's minimum wage is higher), a good amount of hours but not a lot of respect from upper management."
good,its another job would I recommend working there? if times are tough yes or you're in need of a job right away yes everyone gets fed up being there because of management
good,"I worked at Safeway for 4 years, this is the most drama filled workplace you can ever imagine. There is union which stops you from getting hours-helpful to not only you but to the workplace. For example, someone who started working at Safeway two months before you have will aways the same amount or more hours than you; if you are a star employee and they aren't, you cant come in more than they can thus limiting your time to shine. Heart Heart."
good,"Safeway used to be a fun place to work. Seems that since being bought by Albertsons, it's not so much. Safeway used to be customer focused. Now they seem to pile a lot more on your plate, all the while cutting hours and staff causing more lines at the checkstand and angry customers. I long for the old days."
good,New hires were making $3.00 more an hour to start then I was making after 2 1/2 years. I was offered a promotion to cheese specialist I accepted. Unfortunately I still had my deli manager as manager. She refused to let me do my job. There were many things she would not let me do as was listed in my job description. These things of course reflected on my job rating. It was impossible to do my job right.
good,They don't pay well for the work they ask of you and they don't treat you well. They expect a lot out of you but don't appreciate the work you do. I worked there for 5 years with a dollar raise. my last job I earned over a two dollar raise in less than 2 years.
good,Safeway is a good position to gain work experience when just starting out. The position of general clerk requires being adaptable due to having to fill in other positions as needed while fulfilling the base duties.
good,"Working at Safeway was an enjoyable experience on the floor. I liked all of my co-workers but management was not satisfactory, very immature and not qualified for their jobs. Frequently made mistakes on schedules, no paper pay-stub documentation, and employees are not made clear of their rights at work upon employment. Old and outdated technology make the job more difficult for workers and customers."
good,Lots of opportunities to succeed since there is something for everyone and you can never get bored because you can go train in all departments of the store. Can move up if you choose to or can do bare minimum if you would like
good,"If understaffed for the day, it is heck, otherwise it's doable. The management is okay. There are a few health standard issues, like 2 month expired food products"
good,"Didn't care for this job...to many people with attitudes, including management.  Didn't care for shift hours and/or being on my feet all day.  Benefits were decent."
good,"Flexible hours and fast paced work place. Loved everyone I worked with, but my boss was a bit of a hot-head. Other than that, it is great. The store director is super great and easy to talk to. We have employee meetings throughout the week sometimes and it gives the employees a chance to know how the store is doing and allow the employees to speak up about anything if necessary. Safeway is like a family."
good,Good Part-time job for students. There are many hours to go around and the stores are open early to late. There is always availability during holidays.
good,"I worked my way through a lot of different positions with the company. Started as a Courtesy Clerk, then Cashier, then trained Starbucks department, helped out Floral, Bakery, File Maintenance Clerk, and Customer Service Desk before going to another location to work as Starbucks Manager. Some raises over the years, but mainly just kept up with being just over minimum wage. "
good,I quit cause I had the flu and my manager wouldn't let me go home after i already got someone to cover my shift so I hate Safeway but they weren't sfo bad
good,"4 store managers within few months"
good,"One of the managers is a dictator and not a leader. There is no Manager and qualified personnel were bypassed. Not worth the headache. The job isn't too hard, the people that are in charge are."
good,I have 14 years experience and feel like I have seen most of it.  I started out as a courtesy clerk and now currently work on night crew.  I feel like it is never good enough for my managment.
good,"Good people to work with. Mornings are alright to work so you can prepare for the day to begin, afternoons are very busy, the hardest part of working at safeway is when youre short handed and it get busy, especially during the holidays, its very stressfull"
good,"Nice place for play money. Theyll give you the ""experience"" but not the advancement. Theyll use so much where they will criticize what you lacking. Because you doing others work!"
good,"Safeway was hard for me; it was the best job I've had as of yet, but was pretty odd with its hours. Moreover, there seemed to be some lack of communication with the management, since I was asked to work on a free day a few days beforehand, yet I was still called in regardless. Moreover, as good as the management was, I found it to be pretty absent at times or even make plain odd decisions at times. Plus, the times when I would have to run around at different jobs on busy days made it hard for me to be effective anywhere."
good,"Working under Safeway was a great first job, and taught me how to use my time wisely, and how to socialize with the public. Although I wasn't always given a great number of hours, the way the store handheld and cared for my school schedule was very much appreciated."
good,It's fast paced at the bakery department at Vons.  Most co-workers are nice.  You have to be on time at 5 am in order to get the job done otherwise you get behind in your duties.
good,"It's a good place to work for people with out much experience. They do train in store for most positions. Fairly flexible hours. It is a union job for most positions, which means paid holiday pay of some kind."
good,if you like working with people it is fine but they will drive you crazy and your manager could change at any time. if you have a good or bad manager is a roll of the dice.
good,long lines and not enough help to keep lines moving. co-workers were friendly. I was paid less than 9.20 and i worked there for two years. The Union stuff were a pain.
good,"It was nice working during 9-5 hours because there were more staff."
good,There was drama among co-workers but it was over all a decent place to work. The benefits were good and the hours were too. The work wasn't too hard but we still had plenty to do on shift.
good,"The Baker position would be fine if I wasn't paid minimum wage, there are plenty of minimum wage jobs out there that require far less effort. You wake up at 2AM most days to go in at 3AM, and you will most certainly be working 8 hour shifts."
good,"You're days honestly are reflected on the mood of the customer and how you handle it. I've learned plenty of patience from this job, as well as time managment."
good,"stressful, not enough clerks i learned nothing, people are very rude to each other, the hardest part is being the only clerk on a night shift doing everything with no help, the most enjoyable is the customers they usually make your job easier and less stressful."
good,"If anything, working at Safeway is great unless working in the deli department, solely because of the scattered, unorganized, sporadic daily activity."
good,Learned something new each day.  I really enjoyed working with the public and helping out customers.  The most difficult part of the job was balancing all the tills by 11pm and closing the books quickly so the cash registers were only down for a few minutes while customer waited to cashout.
good,"The hours during that time of my life were flexible and matched my lifestyle.  I immediately built strong relationships with the staff at my home store, however that is one of my strong points, as demonstrated repeatedly on my annual reviews.  I've always felt that not only does it make coming to work more enjoyable, but if you don't work well with your coworkers and other healthcare professionals then it's the patients who suffer as well.  A typical day at work was ensuring to lighten the mood in the pharmacy if needed and then dive in to dispensing and fixing problems.  Safeway gave me the tools to open my own store and take on any and all issues related to operating a retail pharmacy.  The most difficult part of the job was allowing others to leave issues/problems/unfinished business for the next pharmacist on duty as I have a hard time not doing everything myself.  I've since learnt to delegate better however if questions arise I end up finishing the work myself rather than explain and show how to fix/complete the problem.  However, teaching and apprenticing comes naturally to me so the reason for taking on issues myself may have been a product of my busy environment and keeping the patients satisfied if I feel they may become impatient.  The most enjoyable part of my job should be unanimous with any other pharmacist's which would be helping our patients the best way we can and ensure they leave happy and feeling they are in good hands."
good,Overall ive had the honor to work with some great people.I enjoyed interacting with different customer. It was a great way to learn what i was good at and what i needed to work. I was able to challenge myself.
good,There is always a chore that you can work on. They let you clean a lot too which I liked. I also like the jobs no one wanted so it made the day go by faster. One co-worker though is quite unbearable
good,"The store managers are extremely lazy and rude with the exception of the second assistant who is the only store manager that does work and is very friendly. There are two good department managers. All of the front end managers are amazing, the produce manager is also amazing. With any other department you will have to rely on your coworkers to keep you positive because your managers will tear you down with their lazyness and ignorance. The pay is decent and the customers are what you expect the public to be, it varies. The hours are pretty decent but do fluctuate. Certain managers are willing to work with you. The pay increases every 6 months and after a year you are provided benefits and vacation days. It's not always fast paced but it can get busy. The front end managers always help during busy times and breaks are always right on time."
good,"Receiving and checking incoming pick tickets, locating products using technology, retrieving orders according to quantity, size and ensuring accuracy.Very fast paced.  The hardest part of this job was their pick standards and the amount of product you needed to pick nightly."
good,"The work culture created by the union along with upper management not knowing how to run a single store creates an environment where everyone wants to quit but they wont because the work is easy and the pay is decent. "
good,"its been too long to remember the little things here. i remember decent work and people, but hardly any hours. if you are looking to fill in a day or two of your week, id suggest"
good,Where mean and would stab you in the back first chance you would let them. Most if the time it was a he said she said kind of day.  A person has to be part of the winning team to be on the good side.
good,"Safeway is an okay place to work for. However, in my experience there I noticed that such places as freezer/refrigerator area in the sense of inventory and organization was very disorganized."
good,"it was a typical work place"
good,"Training needs to be provided for individuals who move up into a higher position. Department Managers need to be able to discuss issues with the Company Manager without being told they are wasting time. The Company Manager should be willing to listen to a Department Managers issues without being told they are making excuses.  A typical day is fast paced and can be stressful.  Team work is a priority.  Everyone has a set amount of work to be done but must also be able & willing to jump in and help out in any area of the department.  It was nice to work in a relatively small department and I enjoyed the feeling of being part of the team.  There did seem to be a high turn around rate, especially among the part time employees.  Much of the work was repetitive but every day was different depending on what came up.  It was nice to get to know some of the customers and know their preferences.  We all strove to keep our customers happy and always tried very hard to correct anything that was unsatisfactory to adequately compensate the customer. The hardest part of the job was working in the freezer, trying to move pallets which were not very well stacked and very hard to move.  The freezer was often unorganized and it was difficult to get to a certain departments products as they were all mixed together.  I believe something should be done at the warehouse level to improve this condition."
good,"The main issue was that there were often scheduling mistakes and miscommunications from management. I enjoyed all of my coworkers, and many of the managers were wonderful."
good,Don’t have a social life your schedule changes weekly a lot of people that work there have been working for the company for over 30 years and are stuck in their ways. It’s hard to teach them new things
good,"Pros: good benefits for full time person"
good,"I have worked for safeway for almost three years now, the main reason i've stayed for so long is because they have good benefits, they are flexible with scheduling and there is a workers union. Management is shady most of thr time, they will try and screw you over on breaks, and not to mention the customers can be really crumby."
good,Safeway is a very great store but when I worked the management was bad and I barely got hours. They pay well and the people are nice. they also don't give a lot of breaks.
good,"Good place to work, the store maintained sort of clean at time. Some of the workers were rude and didn’t know much about customer service but other than that it was good."
good,"As a night stocker I didn't see much of day staff, and I can't say a lot about the management or a typical day, but, It was nice being able to work mostly independently and quietly. Job isn't to hard, and as long as you're a good boy/girl, they'll leave you be and let you do your job."
good,"Customer service"
good,"I left the job because the management was very nagative. The hours weren't very good l, and all over the place. I loved th3 customers,  but that was pretty much all I liked about that job."
good,"I worked there for 4 years was a very nice job. I first worked in meat department then in the meat department as a meat clerk. I enjoyed the work was fast paced, lots of cleaning and meat cutting and filleting fish."
good,"I was working for Safeway.com department. I was a personal shopper for online customers, which involved taking a list of items provided by the customers order and shopping for them, which in turn was delivered later in the same day."
good,the hardest place to work with no good benefits for new hires. limited hours and availability. it takes a while for a associate to gain the hours needed to maintain living standards
good,"slow and easy job. can be stressfuls at certain times of the day when customers over crowd the registers, you see a lot of the community, a lot of familiar faces."
good,"The hardest part about the job is from week to week not knowing what to expect on number of hours given and it can rapidly change depending on the time of month, or time of year. Do not depend on a consistent schedule, time of day always fluctuates as do days off."
good,"I have worked at several stores in two different counties. I had a total of six managers and worked in 5 different departments with different titles. The culture is really set by the mangers and since they change so frequently be prepared to be flexible. Room for promotion depends on the location. In South Orange County promotions were handed out constantly which is awesome! Great learning opportunities. In Riverside County not so much! The only way anyone was getting promoted is if someone quit, was terminated or retired. I learned so much from this company at my original store and I wish that I would've never relocated because I would probably still work for this company. Benefits are great, better for the old contract people. Paid holidays are great, if you are under the old contract. The customers were usually pretty great. The worst part was working nights 4pm-1am 4 nights a weeks, working 11am-8pm Saturday and Sunday and having to work every holiday with small children at home. The schedule changes weekly and you are paid weekly. Great job to start out with or work through college."
good,This company does not give employees consistency with hours to support their families. The communication is terrible on a daily basis as projects change almost weekly but we are not informed. The hardest part of this job is keeping employees motivated who get treated very poorly.
good,"Working at Safeway was not exactly enjoyable. I worked in the meat department serving customers, preparing different meals, and cleaning the several machines and flooring. My coworkers were very nice but the management was not very good."
good,"somedays are better than others, and some customers are better than others, but overall its a solid job that i can rely on, but i do not get enough hours."
good,My typical day would start by going to the register and staying up there until I had to go on break. It would be really busy all the time. Customers would always be rude to you if they didn't get anything there way. The hardest part of the job is always being on your feet and always going to break and lunch late and always get dinged on if you were late.
good,"Safeway is a good company to work for temporarily, as long as you show up everyday and do what is expected there is minimal trouble. The employees gossip with each other about the other employees often in a negative manner. The deli department needs a massive improvement, there are horrible communication issues and the department in general is very disorganized. Management is bad, in less then a year of working there the man manager changes 5 times which made it very difficult to adapt to each different mangers' style of overseeing the store."
good,"Good first job, taught me quite an abundance of how responsibilities should be managed. flexible schedule but not consistent. Fast paced, can be a bit stressful, laziness isn't an option."
good,"Many of the employees worked together, but a supervisor can make the whole store a hard place to work. Safeway does not pay very well, it would be better if they paid "
good,Honestly don’t like this job very much as they say they are understanding but always seem to get upset at you for doing exactly what they say. Wish for a better job than here.
good,All duties were geared to weekly payroll therefore weeks were all repetitive so became boring fast.  The job was very fast paced and deadlines had to be met.  Environment was too open and very distracting.  Quite a lot of upheaval over Albertsons buying Safeway.
good,although they never get paid enough to rule the world lol...Safeway is an ok place to work. My life just went down another path or I would still be there today
good,"Safeway is a great company and I always liked working for them. I'm sure other stores aren't as bad, but this one particular store had been given a  manager and treated all of the employees like they hadn't worked there ever before. I have been there for more than 2 years and we are constantly switching managers because in all honesty, none of the employees like this store and plenty have transferred or quit entirely because of all the frustration that comes with it. They're terrible at staffing enough people in departments and take from other departments, they are also awful at scheduling and treat their employee's unfairly. Some of the managers are rude and unprofessional when we try to call in and wonder why some people don't even call in or run out and quit without even putting in their two weeks. Nobody will really be there to make sure they're not disrespectful to us, but I'm sure it's not all their fault, they can only do so much. Sad to say that I was happy before in my job, but slowly became very unenthused and unmotivated to work there because my pay never moved and I had been promised a promotion and came back every week to the manager to check if I was promoted yet but they never gave it to me. Still no explanation. I was always doing work for others because they didn't do it, but when I miss something, I get in trouble. Countless times has that happened where I was unfairly disciplined for something that was probably someone else's problem that I was trying to or going to have to fix."
good,"Position: Front end service"
good,"You don't get benefits unless you have been full time for over a year. Courtesy clerks do all the cleaning and are the bottom of the line in the store but if you are a good worker they will move you up fairly quickly. They moved me from courtesy clerk to bakery to fill someones position while on vacation, but moved me back to courtesy clerk because the bakery manager wanted someone with open availability. They then scheduled me to fuel station to close alone without my consent which I was not happy about at all. I ended up quitting shortly after because they seemed to cut my hours and not have much respect for me after I declined being moved to fuel."
good,"Worked in Bakery, decorating cakes. Many grumpy bakery staff. serving customers is part of the job. learned many bakery jobs and appreciate the experience."
good,"This was my second time working as a barista for a Starbucks store; however, this was a franchise exclusive to Safeway's and not a corporate Starbuck's store. Nonetheless, we were constantly busy and maintained a fun work atmosphere."
good,"Management was lousy, but co-workers were nice and helpful.  Only worked there as a clerk part-time for a few days, so did not really get to have a real feel for how it was to work their long term.  It was out of my field as a Business Analyst, so I really cannot comment accurately."
good,"I liked some days going into work, when everyone was there. Other days I hated it the deli was busy, we where under employeed and people who where getting hired would quick because of hours or pay. I gay my 2 weeks notice because I felt working hard and getting underpaid was unhealthy for me."
good,"I worked the graveyard shift doing overnight stocking, it was easy but i worked with people who didn't care or even want to try that hard so we usually had to stay an hour or two later every day just so we could finish, it was nice to get the extra hours but was stressful."
good,"I have enjoyed working there and you meet lots of interesting people, However, There is no room for advancement and the atmosphere was starting to get to me. However it was a very nice place to work and learn."
good,"management is constantly rotated for training making it impossible for managers to really know the store, laziness is rampant due to union protection, and generally not a great place to work for long periods of time. If you really need extra money, this would be an alright place to work in the meantime."
good,"I liked the customers, most were kind and fun. I enjoyed the supervisors. I didn't like not being able to work more hours so that I may have benefits. The supervisors were professional and fun to work with. We were a particularly busy store and I wished we could have had more check stands, as it was all check stands were full. They were very consistent about breaks and ensuring we were given for our breaks as scheduled. I liked that I was able to be taught more about the workings of the store by not just checking, but learning how to tag the merchandise. Overall, this was an extremely fast paced, high stress position, that was fun."
good,It was an ok place to work would never consider working there again but it was overall just ok. The customers were always rude and the managers never had our backs.
good,"They were a fast paced environment."
good,The enjoyable part of my job is making the customers happy with providing them with excellent customer service. And the hardest would be the opposite.
good,"The jobs at Safeway are usually pretty tedious and the days drag on, however the people that worked there were fantastic, and the customers usually weren't very rude. It is a great job for students or kids looking to get experience."
good,"Safeway Starbucks has broughten me so many great experiences but unfortunatly the location of the store is it's largest downfall. Safety has always been an issue for the years that I've worked here, with the store being located in the downtown in amidst the homeless, and drug addcited."
good,"not much to say. its a job ."
good,"Not a great place to work from my experience. Everything is super unprofessional. It completely lacks organization and communication. It was like being at high school again with all the drama. I try to keep to myself and do my job. We were Extremely understaffed, constantly. They also cut me short $0.77 an hour for six months and they will take complete advantage of you if you let them."
good,Its an okay place to work if you are a fast learner and dont mind working hard. Stay away from the deli department its the hardest in the store and usually understaffed.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, just not very good wages even with experience. Good for students. Good prices on items and fresh product but no money to be made unless you are a meat cutter or upper management."
good,didn't really like my hours. Didn't really like how look it took for me to get a raise. Glad i got the experience though. nice staff great food hard workers.
good,"Very friendly co-workers and always willing to help! The downside is that the company works archaically and has no intention of evolution. The answer is always ""always been done that way""."
good,"Poor management, the employees were good people , good environment but just poor lazy management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with managers giving me 3 hour shifts."
good,Great way to start your own employement history but not a life time job. Management was very friendly and appreciative but not willing to work with many college students.
good,"While i was not a safeway for a long time, I was there for a couple of months and during the time i spent there i received little to no training on problems that actually occurred on a regular basis because they were not deemed important or necessary, the only thing i would change would be the management other than that it was a solid company with good benefits and also paid ok."
good,they do not care about your life outside of work unless you are a student.  they will make you work when they want you to and are not always willing to work around your schedule.
good,The Pay was excruciatingly low and most times you only made enough to pay your union fees. hours were never constant. Co workers were gossipers and hated the management.
good,Management was there but if you didn't meet standards they cut your hours in half and keep cutting them until you cannot support your family. i would not go back there as first choice.
good,"they seem stingy on hours and want a large quantity of quality work in a short amount of time. i learned how to better manage my time and what to prioritize in such short periods of time. the department manager and assistant manager were really friendly and did the best they could to help out everyone in the department, in my experience the co workers were a little lazy and very expecting. in-store gossip was big in my location. the hardest part of this job was to have perfectly baked goods while also clearing the shelves. the most enjoyable part of my job was to deal and help the customers and gaining further experience in customer service with such friendly customers."
good,not too hard not super easy either if you are a experienced cook it just takes time to memorize all the recipes necessary. can get very hot if you are not experienced in kitchen work
good,could be better its management however that sometimes makes this job difficult.  I wish I could make an impact within my job but being around older and more seasoned guys its not this best place for me.
good,First job I ever had. A good place to start out a working carreer not a great place to work long term. Inconsistencies with work schedule a detriment.
good,Working at Safeway you need a lot of energy and good customer service. The other staff are supportive. The hardest part of the job is the schedule. The best part of the job - is you know you worked hard that day. I learned a lot about customer service.
good,"Great paying job, you have to deal with a lot of stress, that's what the union environment does. I got so much knowledge from being crossed trained asking questions"
good,"Every aspect of working of this company is mediocre. Its not bad, but can definitely be made better. the pay could be higher and most people are not put on full time schedules unless you were already in the old union contracts."
good,"Although room for advancement and salary can be a downside, they were very much willing to work with my college schedule during the Fall and Spring semesters."
good,They don't really care about you they just want the work done so you have to do it. I never really liked working there it seemed like I was always being watched under a microscope and if I do anything wrong there to pounce on me
good,"Come in every night or every other nights sometimes, I Clocked in at 12pm & got off at 8am. Unload pallets of groceries off the truck , It would be 6 of us most nights & other nights it would just be me and two other people unloading trucks. Management in my opinion was poor , they showed favoritism , started cutting back on my hours. Typical week for me was 6 days a week and that dropped down to 2 maybe 3 days a week. The workplace was okay wasn't really my type of an environment but I acted accordingly , the hardest part of the job to me would be me having to unload two or three pallets of water , including soda and juice. The most enjoyable part was on my lunch breaks they would allow us to be able to buy food , chips , juices , candy , anything we wanted."
good,"Typical day at work for me was pushing carts(no matter the weather), cleaning bathrooms and putting food back that the customers didn't want. I didn't really learn much. The management was very mean and not understanding. The hardest part of the job was everything. The most enjoyable part of the job was payday (sometimes)."
good,"While this company does offer good benefits (due ONLY to the union workers belong to) and a fair opportunity to move up, management is trained to see only the bottom line.  A store manager once instructed me to leave dairy products (including eggs, yogurt, butter etc.) on the shelf after it sat unrefrigerated overnight.  Product was temping at 65 degrees.  I threatened to call the health department which is the only reason they let me throw it away.  This company is decent for short term work or if your ultimate goal is to move up into store management ASAP.  I had this job while I worked through college so that wasn't an option for me."
good,"Working at Safeway has taught me a lot of life lessons: not being afraid of hard work, being able to handle stressful situations, and learning how to greet people and problem solve. But they do not value their employees at all. Management only cares about making money, they don't care about their disabled employees or their employees who have been working for their company for over 10 years. I value treating people with respect and having a positive working environment, however Safeway fell short of this."
good,"Too low of pay to bother unless you are in high school. If you like getting cheaper food from the deli and you really like eating food from the Safeway deli, go for it."
good,"It is difficult to match the pay with most other retail management positions. Store Manager positions vary from 75k - 105k depending on experience, etc... Culture is somewhat negative and very high stress. Hours are not very flexible."
good,"It was a hard job."
good,Good place to work if you are willing to pay your dues...literally. They will schedule you the absolute minimum hours possible but expect you to work off the clock to get you job done.....
good,its a good company to work for need to train management more and give more hours the employs are friendly and a joy to work with I would recommend and enjoy would working here again
good,"The tasks of the jobs of clerk are simple but very physically demanding. There is rarely ever down-time. There are always different tasks that need to be done. Expectations are high from management to fill the bakery with products and not leave holes in displays. I've learned strategy, time management skills, new bakery skills from other positions such as baker's assistant, cake decorator, and bakery manager. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting along with my coworkers. However, satisfied customers who greet you and thank you also make the job better."
good,"They were helpful , very nice to the customers . Overall it was a great place to work . I would get the days off that I needed and they were always good at telling people that they were doing a good job . One thing that I really liked about working there was the fact that you never left bored you were always having a good time"
good,"this job was very stressful,hours very from day to day. production numbers didn't matter because you always have to do more. working there you didn't make enough money to live ."
good,"Standard grocery environment of the day. Can be stressful and very demanding. Local and regional supervisors are at constant odds in regards to how they want things done; one says this...another says that. Changes are constant and ongoing. If you understand what it means to work ""with great urgency"", then you will thrive in this environment."
good,"good wages if you have been there awile,  excellent training programs and free staff lunches as rewards for performing excellent customer service.  good union !"
good,"You learn a lot very quickly working here, as a baker I got the full 40 hours usually. Although they list almost everyone as part time so they can cut your hours a TON if they feel like it, which they do sometimes. Overall, I dont regret working here and am sad to leave because Ive met some awesome people here,  but management is so unresponsive. I've asked to be scheduled day time only for years and they just do not care, they scheduled me working back to back shifts with less than 8 hours between on a regular basis. Employees are treated as disposable despite doing an awesome job. I see coworkers being treated just as poorly and it makes me angry to see this company just casually using people up without even trying to treat them decently. The pay is decent, and it gives you great experience and time management skills, but I just cant reccomend it as a long term job.... at least not the Bakery department... it seems like the harder you try to improve things the more they just take advantage of you. Being treated so poorly and having your concerns dismissed without a thought can really demoralize a person.  The work was great, and I liked helping the customers... but the schedule was intolerable, they went so far as to tell me that I was not *allowed* to ask for a normal schedule!"
good,"Management is horrible!!!! You have to do other people jobs as well as yours. Continuously have to ask management about sick pay, payroll errors as well but its never there fault. Plenty of finger pointing!!!!!"
good,good company til joined with albertson all i can say all i can say i do not think that good benefits. it is unfair when it comes to Human Resources as they come down go off on you if someone said something even not true
good,"Good place to work for."
good,Management was okay had too many issues with communication between managers interacting with the customers was the best part just perfecting their drinks and giving them the top Quality customer service they deserve was a personal goal of mine
good,"Typical day at work is clock on, help load groceries to shopping carts, collect carts out in the parking lot, tend to customers needs, make sure that the store was picked up and organized"
good,"Typical working environment of any supermarket."
good,"It really depends on what store you work at and who you work with on a daily basis. I had a boss who didn't care and it showed. I got a total of a dollar raise over the course of working there. Everyone expects new people to quit or not show up. Very low morale. Only the people who have been working there for 10+ years have any encouraging words to say, and they usually don't say them. If you work your tail off, you may eventually get into a department. But that isn't much better."
good,They were really in need of people so although I only wanted to work 24 hours a week because it was my first real job they scheduled me full time and it took a lot of hard work to clean and make food in the deli.
good,"typical day at work is being a cashier and helping out customers with finding product and through the cash, management is the best in the store they help you out with anything, the most enjoyable part is working with my employees and getting through everything together"
good,I had some great managers who actually cared about their employees and I had some terrible managers who cared only about their numbers and were not above threatening employees on the sales floor. I left when it seemed all the good managers were gone.
good,"a typical work day starts off good, i have plenty of happy customers, and what i learned at this job is to keep to myself. management is ok. hardest part of the job is working until 1 or 2 am in the morning. the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know a few great coworkers and having awesome customers."
good,Overall a good place to work nice people.  Built good rapport with the public.  There's no healthcare.  You now have to work two years to get it.  There's not enough help scheduled to move the lines faster.  Some management is like a robot they don't really listen to the needs of their employees.  And some management is really good to their employees.  So not stable management.  Not a lot of opportunity for promotion.
good,"The typical day at safeway would be engaging conversation with customer and doing the best of my ability to get the customer what they and have them wanting to come back. My job consist of slicing, weighing and selling merchandise such as hams, turkeys, cheeses, and chicken. What I have learned the most from my job is customer service skills, such as engaging with the customer, seeing what the customer likes and working with the best of your ability to get the customer exactly what he/she wants."
good,"Safeway was a fun company, I really liked my boss and the company gave me several different opportunities. They relocated me several times to take on under performing stores. It was always very challenging."
good,It's a job. Can't complain too much but ever since Albertsons took over the company just doesn't care about its employees anymore. It was a decent place to work before that. Now it's just the place I go to make money
good,Great place to work but pay and job advancement is hard to come by. Management doesn't seem to care if employees stay or go and tend not to fight to keep hard working employees with the company
good,"good start off job, learned how to communicate with customers and with co workers. Not hard once you got the hang of your position. depending on who your manager is sets the environment of your work day."
good,the staff is nice to work with and helpful the  job is fun but you get wet when cleaning machines and soundtrack company plays gets very repetitive  in store.
good,It would be very fun to work together as a team to reach an overall daily sales goal. We could high-five each other overtime one of us sold 10 special drinks. The tasks were given to the person that would be excellent at doing them. If there were any personal life issues the overall staff would provide comfort.
good,It was mainly just a job whilst I was in high school. I took the job seriously because I wanted to do well. I actually got promoted and raises throughout my 5 years there. I've learned a lot about myself and people in general - but nothing directly related to graphic design.
good,"Working with friendly customers always a bonus"
good,"A typical day at work for me was pretty busy because I worked at the customers service desk. I was by myself and i learned that I have the skills to multitask so much. I had to do cashier, money orders , lottery and so much moreat once."
good,"It was a good job, but was difficult to manage, many employees quit, there was uch turnover, and often you had to take up the slack. Did have good job protection."
good,Since it is retail the schedule can vary widely.  Management is down to earth and easygoing.  Company goals are very attainable.
good,"Working at Safeway is not difficult, but you are not given any respect, they do not care about any personal or medical problems you may have, and if they do not like you management will find a way to get you fired. Most of the people who are not management were very friendly and upbeat. The atmosphere is great when management isn't around."
good,"Safeway standards are very high. It can be a stressful environment to work in. They expect you to give your 100% all day, every day. The pay is not competitive at all and in my opinion, not enough for the work expected."
good,"When I started working things were a little bit hectic, but after a few months things smoothed out after more people got hired."
good,"When I started with Safeway in 2004, it was still a decent job to get. Safeway was bought out by another company a couple of years ago and things have been on a downslide ever since. The person who used to assist me in my department is only getting 4-8 hours per week now. Sales are down for the 3rd year in a row, so they keep cutting back hours. Safeway only hires on a part-time basis, you must work your way up to full-time. But who can live off a paycheck for only 4 or 8 hours? This is why I don't recommend working there."
good,"I always felt safe working for this company, and it gave me good experience. But I feel like the store was constantly mismanaged, and the scheduling was poor."
good,Safeway pays weekly and has union benefits. its an okay job depending where you work and whom you work with. It was okay but the pay for me where i worked was not cutting it. you get raises yes but once you reached a certain amount of hours.
good,coworkers are excellent teamworkers and always willing to help when needed. there is always something to do and lots of people to help and assist. very hardworking area
good,"Often worked only 1 or 2 days a week sometimes while the following week I was scheduled for 5-6 days. It was very inconsistent. Also, pulled a lot of late night shifts and the reason for this was, ""You are new."" Safeway has a good selection so customers were always pleased which was wonderful. But the hours, scheduling and pay were really not worth it to me."
good,"Good organised work environment. Management disagreed with each other passive aggressively, created an environment of gossip. co-workers were kind but turnover was high. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the passive aggressive environment and their inflexibility with my one day a week i needed off, but the work was enjoyable."
good,"Working in the Deli one has to  jump from slicing meat, serving cold salads, hot deli products and Chinese hot food plus make sandwiches. Also there is the kitchen area for frying foods and baking chicken and whole chickens. One of my disappointments is that they do not have any instructions posted on what the temperature for the different items of  food should be cooked at or even the length of time. Safeway usually has 2 employees that handle all the above tasks. A good offset is that you will get muscles from carrying boxes and loose weight from running to and from the department."
good,The store was a nice place to work at but the management is not that good dude to poor management skills and no one being upfront with the workers
good,My coworkers were very nice and helpful I loved contributing to new ideas and helping out with file management. The managers were very kind and helpful people
good,"I love my job but Albertsons ruined Safeway when they took over. We lost hours, good sales, and money is being cut everywhere. I miss the old Safeway."
good,Safeway did provide benefit options until the employee was with the company for one. The other aspects of the company are good for beginning a career in management.
good,"Fast paced place to work with always something to do, customers are most of the time happy as long as everyone is on the same page"
good,"always a fast busy place, always have something to do. Greet customers, facing, keep store clean. Coworkers are great, customers appreciate you, you have your normal long time shoppers and new shoppers/customers that are new to the store, always get to meet new people."
good,"Typical day is usually busy"
good,"A typical day at work consists of going through back stock, straightening the products on the shelves then unloading the pallets and placing in the proper aisles. You'd then have to stock the products and make sure the labels are facing forward and are presentable for customer purchase."
good,Very little raises.....no set schedule unless you become a department manager....very friendly people though could do a better job on training though
good,"The hardest part of the job is working in retail, dealing with insurance problems. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with customers."
good,I love working here. I was a deli clerk at the time . i made all the sandwiches for the customers and kids getting out of school. i enjoyed making the customers satisfied.
good,"While my co-workers were nice, there wasn't much else to 'write home about'. It seems that the time to take a break was different every few months, the main manager was not very approachable and not very sympathetic to her employees. On the plus side I got to interact with people from around the world."
good,"Its mostly busy during a typical day at safeway.. I learned how to interact with customers when I first became a cashier. After two years at safeway i was promoted to starbucks when they finished the remodel and i was eager to learn how to adapt to that change. The new management team was okay, and i enjoyed working with the new baristas. The hardest part of working there was knowing there is little advancement and seeing its time to search for something geat than a retail store.The most enjoyable part was serving each customer with a smile and great hospitality."
good,You can expect to get moved to a department if you present yourself with a good image. I started off as a courtesy clerk but I was then moved to the bakery department to help them close out. Then I was then splitting up time between the Bakery and the Deli Department. You can't expect an increase in pay but you can be given bigger responsibilities which will only help you develop skills.
good,"Good place to work but with limited or no growth at all."
good,"As the asst. deli manager, I interacted with customers as well as employee's from different departments. Never knew what the day was going to bring on! Upper management not paying attention to what was going on in the department and how people were not doing their work. Also never knowing what your shift was until Friday's"
good,"In my first year at Safeway I was very happy and satisfy with my workplace, but over the years up until now I am becoming less satisfy and ready for a change. Safeway has recently been taking over by another company and I feel it was for the worse. Corporate expects too much out of the pharmacy staff and we are constantly understaff. Most of the time they can't find coverage and if they do the floater tech is incompetent or extremely new.  They recently started upgrading their pharmacies with a new Rx processing system and not everyone has been trained on it, such as the float pharmacist and technicians. So when they come to my pharmacy that has the new system I am stuck training and is unable to do my own work because I am getting pulled away every 5 minutes to answer questions of the staff or to help assist the customers. If only the corporate thought this process out better and began the training process with the float team so when they do come across a pharmacy that has this new system they will be able to help, instead of hinder the staff at that pharmacy."
good,"Great place to work, people are friendly. Learning is never ending, as we're expected to learn qujckly and be self sufficient."
good,"A typical day at work would be, you punch in and you're already dressed in the Deli Clerk attire. You say hello to your fellow workers, wash your hands and put on your plastic gloves. Right away you serve any customers that are tending to your service and fulfill any tasks that need to be completed within your shift. Its a long, busy but productive day filled with constant work; serving, cooking, cleaning, and keeping record of everything."
good,it was a good first job. i learned many usefull skills that i can use for future jobs. i enjoyed getting to know new people and feel like a family.
good,"This company is not a bad company to work for, but you really need to adjust your personal life, in order the accommodate the company needs."
good,A stepping stone to move onto somewhere else. They will mostly work around your school schedule and the union ensures that you won't be working 8 hours a week.
good,"It was okay. I liked the benefits and the pay was better than other starting jobs in the area. Of course, customers were always horrible to work with and it never helped that my manager didn't schedule enough people during rush hour. However, I think that's the case anywhere. Co-workers were always friendly and happy to help, so that was very nice. Overall a good starter job."
good,"My typical day in the bakery was taking orders and decorating the customers cakes or cupcakes. I learned quite a few things actually. They taught me how to make roses on my first day. The management in bakery was great. Just she had more favoritism in other and claimed it was ""senority"". The employees there were great. They were very fun, very outgoing, loved to talk and very very happy. We all laughed alot, other departments called us ""the fun department"". We all seemed like family in the bakery. The hardest part of the job was getting big orders done in an hour or 2 by yourself because the other cake deco was off that day. The most enjoyable part is seeing the customers leave happy when they see our work we have done for them."
good,Average pay but little benefits or pension when employed there. Don't know what it's like now or if it has improved. Workplace culture at that time was low.
good,didn't care would not work here again. low pay. hated it. it went out of business.. people now work at alberstons. was fun at some times ok ok ok ok ok ok ok .
good,"Working for Safeway is not too hard and you do simple tasks depending on the department your in, from minor food prep to packaging foods and stocking items, and helping customers get what they want and following simple work standards and hazard and safety rules. You can have good customer relations, and its overall a decent work environment. Your weekly hours will always very and you will usually get hours you don't want."
good,The job is very physical and tough.  Not enough time to complete everything.  Management seems clueless.  It seems that the managers should stick around more often and see that we have a lot of customers to deal with instead of getting mad if we didn't complete other tasks.
good,I constantly was doing manager work for barely above minimum wage and working 40+ hours a week while going to school to keep whatever department I was in up and running. I left because I wanted something that I could grow more in.
good,Co-workers were great and there were opportunities to move to different departments to learn new things. Salaries were a bit low for the area.
good,"It was ok, great people but money was not worth it and management started mistreating others and making false promises. It was not a good environment to be in so I left. Learned a lot about time management and how to be focused and on task. All in all, average entry level job."
good,"An average day at Safeway usually consisted hours of stressfulness in the front end of the store. A battle you may call it of who exaclty is doing what and when. The 15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunches to be given to employees are rarley given on time due to the lack of help in the front end. Managent is slacky, most of the time just sitting the the private office talking to one another when checkers up front could use assitance bagging groceries if a Courtesy Clerk is not available at the moment for such reasons such as: fetching shopping carts from the parking lot, cleaning or is already occupied on another checkstand. Days requested off are more commonly ignored or ""misunderstood""."
good,"A typical day is a nonstop day with so much to do in so little time.  I learned how to prepare hot and cold foods with the proper holding temperature.  Customers first.  They need to be happy when shopping, and getting what they need.  My work place is a diverse workplace.  The hardest thing to do in any given day is to accomplish everything to have it done.  The most enjoyable part of the day is the end when I am about to leave."
good,As a former employee susanville safe ways still needs room to improve on giving hard working employees credit every once in awile. You work here goes unnoticed and they only talk to you when you do somthing wrong or need a shift covered. Employees here should treat this job as a stepping stone. Also hours are horrible you will have a full schedule one week and the next week you will have half the hours with split days off. I really don't recommend working here but it is a good place to start if your in high school.
good,"I started out as an food clerk at Safeway and that was really cool. Within a month in i had the opportunity to be a supervisor one day out of the week to cover an existing front end manager on their off day. Great place to move up in if you really want to, doesn't really take long to do that. After a while things start to get messy you have to take up more roles than you are paid for because people lack their responsibility. it gets stressful after a while, I've noticed there were too many childish acts going on and the older people were stuck in their ways."
good,"there are a lot of different opportunities at safe way, great learning experience, fun workplace. working for safe way makes it really easy to move you can travel, relocate, transfer wherever you want and still have a job."
good,This company is a good company but has lacked in worker appreciation. It still has work stability but it is less hours. It has a good employee discount program.
good,"they talk a lot about customer service but don't seem to really mean it, wages are very low and not up to industry levels. most employees are part time and your schedule makes it hard to find other part time work. bottom line, employees don't feel appreciated which makes store morale low"
good,A decent place to work with a sometimes supportive management team. You tend to feel as though you're unimportant or useless. Even if you're the only one in your department doing anything right.
good,Typical Day was non stop moving. I learned customer service and deli services. Management didn't listen. co workers were the best part of the day. and the hardest part was how much stress upper management puts on their employee's
good,"Lots of customer interaction. Lots of walking ,pushing carts, mops and brooms. I enjoy most of the physical aspects of the job. working well with others, being a team player."
good,I've learned a lot from working at Safeway like getting to work in more than two departments and learning to order my co workers are so fun to be around and we all help one another with lots of things
good,Usual day consists of spending 6-8 hour shifts in the check stand ringing up customers and helping with customer service. Management is usually too busy trying to improve other departments instead of working upfront.
good,good staff always willing to help and good place to work fun fast paced enjoyable easy stuff at the deli making sandwiches
good,Working at Vons was great for those who might not have family or responsibilities during the day as this position was for nights/graveyard.
good,"I'm 50 years old, and in my 12th year of this grocery career.  100% of all evaluations are rated Superior (mostly all 2's with some 1's).  In my self-motivated multi-task environment I remain calm in stressful conditions as the head bookkeeper/supervisor.  I am unable to be paid at least $14.00/hour.  Pathetic.  Slap in my face."
good,"i would get to work and check out people who needed gas as well as if they bought items from the store. i learned how to unload a truck and put the product away. the management was nice, my co-workers were friendly and helpful, the hardest part was when there was nothing to do for most of the day but wait for customers. the most enjoyable part was when you could actually help out a customer."
good,must work fast to package and place bakery goods on shelves learn to have a overview of which products are done first enjoy working with co-workers the hardest part of the job is slicing bread the most enjoyable part of the job  is placing bakery goods on shelves
good,"The experience was average.There was a lot of favoritism and management was only quick to respond to customer complaints and not internal problems.The hours of availability I was hired for was not honored.I was told""This is our store your application availability does not apply"""
good,"I really did not like working for safeway, i worked as a deli/ starbucks clerk i split my shifts each day. The people i worked with were misserable."
good,"I was pregnant when I got hired, and got hired on as a Bookkeeper/Customer Service. When i was trying to to my Bookkeeper duties which I was not familiar with yet, they still expected me to run costumer service and do all paper work plus count money all by myself. Oh yeah and I couldn't leave until I was done with all the paper work. That was the only down fall. Other than that before customer service opened, I loved being a bookkeeper."
good,"Well a typical day work is coming at 5am start preparation for the morning shift, that includes bringing things out of our coolers and freezers. I've learned a lot since I've been working at Safeway but I it's time for me to move on. The Management are very well trained and very helpful to the staff and costumers . My coworkers are the best people I've ever work with in a while but all my experiences threw the years have been fun and it makes the day go so much faster. The hardest part of the day is trying to get thing done before our day is done and the most enjoyable part of the day is seeing costumers buying our baked goods."
good,"I started work at two in the morning. Around five in the morning is when other employees show up. I baked bread, bagels, fried doughnuts, and baked other goods. I would help out customers finding groceries. I learned baking temperatures, and ingredients, and how to run a bakery. Management changed a month into me starting at Safeway. Saying that, the new manager was not very professional. You could say she was transparent and not very friendly. Over seven employees left Safeway within a two month period. The girls I worked with were friendly. The hardest thing was working by myself in the morning hours, and the amount I had to accomplish. After a month I began to accomplish the amount of work that was asked of me, which was encouraging. I enjoyed talking with employees and customers."
good,The hardest part of being a cashier was trying to go as fast as possible without making any mistakes to satisfy the customers. Also while keeping a conversation with the customer.
good,Safeway is a typical retail job. It is good experience for a first job. There is some advancement but most people do not seek those opportunities.
good,"Safeway is a good place to work and has very professional standards. The employees are mainly nice and treat each other well. The customers are great people, especially the regulars that come in."
good,"In my 10 and a half years of working for this company I have learned that you have to be able to give up most of your family life if you are looking for advancement, Starting of at 17 Safeway was a great place to work as I had no other responsibilities but as I grew older and made plans to do more outside activities I realized that working in an environment where nothing is set makes it extremely hard to balance having a home life, Safeway is a great place for advancement you just have to be able to know that comes with giving up a lot of any spare time that you thought you would be able to have."
good,This place if you have to touch freight at all will break your back. Management is awful. Co-workers are grumpy. There is no in house security and there are times when you literally fear for your safety.
good,"Always worked by myself never with any co-workers."
good,"I liked the people that I worked with, however there became fewer and fewer of them. When I started there was a pharmacy manager and 2 full time technicians. After 2.5 years there was a pharmacy manager, and 1 part time technician. This continued decrease in the pharmacy workforce created an environment in which dangerous mistakes could occur."
good,"I very much enjoyed the diversity of the work.  And the diversity of the people that I worked with."
good,"I would start the day receiving what work needed to be done first and process the days delivery of stock to the shop floor in a professional and safe manner. "
good,Fast paced environment with ability to advance. The most enjoyable aspect is to work with a variety of individuals. Employees are friendly and knowledgeable. Management can be a bit overbearing.
good,"I worked in 3 different departments: Front end as a courtesy clerk, bakery, and Starbucks Batista."
good,It is hard to move up in this company. They like to give you false hope in regards to promotions. Otherwise it is an easy job.
good,"It was a good experience for me while i was in school "
good,"very fast pasted, employees are great, the management needs some work, the pay is horrible for how much you have to do. the hours are awful you work every holiday usually. the customers make your days better. its a very easy going place. Everyone usually gets along so there isn't too much drama."
good,started as a bag boy and worked my way up to check when i turned 18. Management was good but changed every year or 2. Pay was just above min wage.
good,"I dealt with the items in the deli, and made many sandwiches."
good,They don't really give you the days off for holidays nor do they take seniority serious.
good,"This was a decent job, we always stayed busy during the work day and took the safety of our customers and ourselves very seriously, the fuels station always stayed bust until the end of the closing shift.  The management was organized and the pay was decent as well. employees always did their best to work as a team and always took work seriously. Other than the occasional unruly customer, the job was an overall good experience."
good,Many people were hired without a proper interview. Many of the people hired did a quarter of the work that they were hired to do. The hardest part of the job was picking up the slack left behind other employees. The most enjoyable part was discovering new hardworking co-workers which later became close friends.
good,"You work hard for little pay! Not understanding of life beyond work and if you can not work hours that they want you to work even after you discussed your reasons with management, they take your hours away!"
good,"A typical day working as a courtesy clerk included bagging groceries, helped customers find products in-store, helping carry groceries to customer vehicles, retrieving shopping carts, cleaning-up isle spills, general help, etc. While in Safeway's employment I learned how to effectively communicate with others as well as teamwork. The most enjoyable part of this job was helping people and meeting new people."
good,Very large volume and fast past.we paid attention to detail to ensure proper handling of food.
good,"This was a great first job when i was 15, some rare bad management but overall a great work space to get started with a corporate work career."
good,"its an alright job to start out. the pay is kind of different, i didnt like getting paid every week and the hours are super low unless you beg for some"
good,"Work Life balance does not exist here if your in management. Pay is good, but you pay for it with a loss of family time."
good,"This was my experience, from half a decade of Safeway. I would not work for Safeway again, but I would not necessarily advise against it. It is easy to get hired and there are lots of different departments. If you don't like what you're doing, with a little time and effort you can switch to something else."
good,"The job was fun. I learned how to cut meat properly and sell it also. The marks for management is low because they expected the impossible, it takes about 30 an hour to cut a chuck right. They wanted it in 15."
good,On a productive day where it was busy id have a great day cause i was one of the fastest checkers there in a day. id help all new employees learn what to do and make sure they didnt mess up. co-workers were all great. most of the management were ok except the store manager. i learned alot from there mostly as a checker. and its what made me a quick and responcable checker
good,Safeway was a very good company to work for - the people are great to work with and there is a lot of opportunity within Safeway for growth.
good,"Typical day as a cashier consisted of opening the cash drawer and adding money, cleaning bathrooms, bagging groceries, taking care of customer needs and taking break for lunch 15-30 min. Learned best customer service, good cashiering and how to stock products neatly.  Management was excellent and really cared about the employees. Co -workers were often negative and irratable and occasionally called out of work resulting in extra shifts for myself.  Hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for over 8 hrs with only a short break for lunch.  The best part was the interaction with all the customers, asking how their day was and giving them a positive experience."
good,learned a lot and was well taught tricks and trades of the grocery industry.
good,management was great and i liked my co workers. i learned  more customer service skills here.
good,"Not flexible with schooling . Management played favoritism, co-workers were out for them selves . When someone needed a shift covered I was there not only to help out but for a quick chance to get some more hours on the books , but when you needed a shift covered they were not willing to return the favor ."
good,Safeway taught me the principles of customer service and time management.
good,a typical day is fast paced providing customers with quality service depending upon customer needs.
good,"assist customers by providing excellent customer service and giving them a pleasant experience through the check out, as well as helping out the front desk when needed to answer phones."
good,decent place to work. not the best not the worst. been with them a few years and took months to get the right training i need to get a raise. upper management not the best.
good,"This is a good place to work, I feel like every store is understaffed and overworked!"
good,A very greasy and fast paced environment. Regular customers made me happy.
good,typical days started with getting a work list with daily and weekly projects to be done. I learned a lot from working at Safeway Bread Plant about how to clean different machines and the difference between allergen cleaning of certain machines and what machines are not allergen areas. Co-workers are put to specific areas. the hardest part
good,"I have been with Safeway for 13 years and I have done a wide variety of jobs throughout the store.  I am always multi-tasking almost everyday, doing something different almost every day. I really enjoy my co-workers, their are a wide variety of people working at the store, so it makes the job interesting. In addition, the management in the store is pretty good all around, but their are some members of management who aren't very professional nor nice."
good,"Duties included: Manage both opening/ closing procedures;  led a staff of 20-75; including time and attendance; customer service; customer check out; order for LADS, Shipping and Receiving; credit returns to vendors and warehouse items; inventory prep; set the meds for the week and the lobby; complete OOS and BRI"
good,"Customer satisfaction is the most enjoyable part of the job...at the end of the day, that's who matters the most. You will grow the business and ensure sustainability."
good,"My time spent at Safeway Grocery Stores was filled providing customer service, cash handling, shelf stocking, inventory and loss prevention. Advancement was slow as was the pay grade increase, though the benefits were decent and the work load was easy. I decided to leave Safeway for a more promising opportunity."
good,"The work was great, the middle management made it a nightmare job. backstabbing, power struggles."
good,I work in the Industrial Engineering department on a team of 4 people including the Department Manager. We essentially assist in managing everything with the stores within the division from efficiency standards to waste management services to process/schedule improvement on a daily basis.There are currently about 125 stores ranging from Virginia up through New Jersey.
good,"typical day is loading orders onto trucks to deliver to customers,"
good,Lots of physical work the harder and faster you work the more you get paid
good,"Myself and one or two other employees bring the freight load out onto the sales floor, ranging from 5 to 12 or more pallets.  We break down all the boards, placing the merchandise on the corresponding aisles.  Pick up all the empty boards and extra allocated merchandise if any, returning it to the backroom.  "
good,The pay is pretty decent its just that you max out fairly quickly and then have no where to advance from there. I maxed out within 2 years and have not had a raise for about 5 years. I also have to travel pretty far for work and I cant get moved closer to home (it seems a lot of techs I meet at work here are in the same situation. 96% of people get hired here at part time status. The one good thing is they atleast offer benefits wether you work part time or full time.
good,"I managed the cash register, helped customers who needed it"
good,As a checker at a supermarket you schedule will be odd hours and weekends.
good,Pay could be better.  They provide good tools to enable you to complete the work.
good,"I set up the cases, cleaned the department. Filleted fish, prepared food for the meat case. I really liked the people that I worked with, as well as the regular customers. The downside to Safeway was the lack of hours. I only got about 25 hours a week."
good,"bag groceries, push carts, clean the store."
good,"Great location if you are a shopper (across from Stoneridge Mall). The company is a great company to work for, the people are great and departments are fun and rewarding."
good,"Overall Safeway is a good place to work. The atmosphere is good, working with good co-workers and fair management. Pay and benefits were sufficient for my living but the advancement was a bit poor for me. I wanted to move up in Safeway but not many positions were made available for me or were quickly filled."
good,My typical is to walk store saying good morning to each employee while writing down what assignments will need to be completed. Once I have finished walking I will go upstairs and begin looking at emails and doing time and attendance once I finish this I will go back downstairs and begin merchandising the store and looking at my to do list. Customer service is my most enjoyable part of the job taking care of my customers is my number one priority. The hardest part of my job is not accomplishing everything that day but I know what I leave today will be there tomorrow.
good,First job learned alot very great place to work and grow great pay
good,"The job is fine for the time filler, it starts rough for entry level employee's.  If you work hard they will enjoy you, but also tend to lean on you as you watch coworkers slack and put the load on you.  You have the ability to move around the store at a decent rate, but depending on management you may be stuck due to the friend factor.  Not a major fan of the union, but that's the nature of the beast."
good,"break down the load which is about 300-400 pieces. Then throw. then face the store. Some days we have gro. load and frozen load to throw. the hardest part of the job is throw like a mad man and its never enough. it seems to me that management thinks its more important to face the store instead of stocking it.  I say ""We sell product not pretty""but yet I see a lot of employees standing around and doing nothing and getting away with it."
good,Super Market environment with time scales to achieve tasks and customer service was very important.
good,"I usually checked out customers with their groceries. I also was able to try other departments such as the bakery and floral. I miss my co-workers, but do not miss working in retail."
good,"A typical day at work was packaging, labeling, and stocking food on the shelves in the bakery. I learned a lot about how to do mass baking and fast hands with packaging. I learned how to find different techniques when working with different co-workers. The hardest part about this job is there isn't a lot of movement and you have a lot of hoops to jump through for simple questions. The most enjoyable part about my job was the people interaction."
good,"you would come in and start filling scripts, be in a great mood!!! always be a people person. i have learned so much about the drugs and what they do. Loved my co workers made alot a friendships everyone is very nice. The hardest part is seeing patients in pain or sick or just plain upset. I love helping people. love talkig to people about anything always there for anyone and everyone. Also seeing customers who  relationship with have passed away or a love one. Always send a card to the family."
good,"A typical day at work consist of customer relations, cleaning, i learned how to bag real good and different types of fruits. The management is okay could be a little more professional, my co-workers were a joy, hardest part was working until 12am when it busy. My most enjoyable moments were getting good reviews from customers."
good,"◦	Provided a high level of customer service"
good,"Safeway was my first job, it was very clean, friendly and fun place to work. My managers & supervisors were not as friendly as my coworkers, they ignored us, thought of ways to make us stay longer than was required, even after we had already clocked out."
good,"I worked there part time while I went to school. This isn't my type of work environment, but it was ok. "
good,"A work day at Safeway consist of coming in on time for my shift, checking in and get updated everyday on the  store's standings. Most of the shift consist of cashiering and bookkeeping while delivering superior customer service. Everyday I learn different effective ways to communicate with others, increase sales as well as learn how to manage a store a little each day."
good,I worked as part of a great team. I enjoyed working here a lot.
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Safeway was the kindness of my fellow employees. I learned a lot about customer service and communication. 
good,Safeway is a good place to work with plenty of opportunities to advance. The standard work day for managers is ten hours. If you are able to come in with some experience you can make a decent salary. 
good,"A typical day at work at Safeway would consist of waking up around midnight and going to work n clocking in at 2:00 a.m. in morning. I was usually the only one in my department working at that hour until another co-worker would show up at 6 or 8 a.m. As my shift started I would proceed to the cabnet where we have are aprons and then put on my hair net. After turning on the oven  and the proof box, i would then head over to the fridge and pull out three rakes full of frozen products. I begin to put condiments needed before sticking them into the proof box for 30 - 40 minutes depending on each product. They while waiting for those to become proofed, I woud log in the destress products that happen to have not been sold the day prior. Once disposing of such n taking note of I proceed to start the frying of the donuts and baking of the bagel's, danish's, flone's, deli bread and French bread. Before 6 comes around every kind of donut needs to be iced and display in a clean orderly case when the store opens. Then as scheduled for a lunch around this time is proximately an hour, you wanna make sure when clocking in or out is always on time. When coming back from lunch and clocking back in, some of your coworkers will now be on clock aswell on hand whenever help is needed. Now making 50 pounds of French bread is your priority while keeping up with orders, phone calls, frate coming in, and assisting any customer's in the mean time. After managing to do so, it would be time to prepare for prep for the next day as the rest of your shift is to produce more products that are becoming low"
good,"Working for Safeway was enjoyable, there was plenty to learn. I cross trained in several departments. The co-workers were great to work with. The customers were very nice and I had plenty of regulars. It was a very fast paced place but enjoyable."
good,"I was promoted to dairy manager. I came in and took a department that had 40+ out-of-stocks a day to 7-8 a day. The size of the loads that came in everyday was a two man job. I was given an incompetent helper everyday who disappeared for hours at a time. No matter what I did or told the helper, he/she did not listen. Upper management did not do anything about him/her either, which was very annoying. On top of doing 4/5 of the job by myself, I was constantly called out of my department to do cashiering or shipping/receiving. I did not mind doing all of these things with the store manager at the time, but he got transferred to another store. The new manager did not handle stress as well as the previous manager. Soon afterward, a new district manager was chosen and he had the store managers put added UN-needed pressure on all the department leads. The stressed out store managers kept on giving us more work with less hours to do them. The only reason why most of us did not leave was because we loved the other employees. However, it is obvious that the company is trying to push out 'senior' employees to get lower-paid employees in their places. I found out this is the trend in a lot of different locations. The employee morale has drastically declined since starting in 2005, and especially since the new district manager has been in place."

good,"A typical day at work starts with signing in at your check stand, ringing up groceries by scan or using codes. A typical day is very busy and checking at a non stop pace. Customer service is a very important part of my daily routine and I excel at it. I have learned hundreds of produce codes and how to operate the register along with many facets that go with it, such as EFT, EBT, WIC, checks, voiding of items, returns, along with great customer service. The management team I work with is very knowledgeable and helpful not to mention extremely nice and easy to work with. I enjoy working with my co-workers as everyone is friendly and helpful when needed. The hardest part of my job is standing in one place and doing repetitive movements for an entire shift. The thing I enjoy most about my job are the people, co-workers and customers alike."
good,"The store wasnt kept up to date, wasnt clean like other safeways ive been to."
good,"coming in setting up front line.slicing meat ,cheeses etc; for front cold case making any changes required by deli manager.learned how to weigh and price food accordling.management could have been a little more professional co -workers were easy to get along with the hardest part of the job is sometimes having to do three people job the most enjoyable was satisfying my customers"
good,"I would come in and talk to my supervisor, and ask ask what she wanted me to do. I went around the store and picked up items that a customer had on her shopping list, I would go up front and assist with bagging the groceries, and assist the customers to their cars. I would bring the shopping carts from the parking lot."
good,"Being a cashier @ Safeway is fast-paced and the shifts go by very quickly; the other cashiers are fun to work with. Management is pretty good and are easy to talk to and get along with. Unfortunetly, since it's based on seniority, there isn't alot of room for advancement or increase in hours and they are very inflexible about working around my schedule (ie: my spouse is now working night shifts & we have no babysitter for late nights); since I'm unable to work late nights anymore, Safeway wants to cut my hours even though I'm not getting alot of hours."
good,"I love going to work and taking on many responsiblities and making sure all the customers that go in and out are completely satisfied. I learned throughout the years by always taking on jobs that deal with community and customer service that customer service is your first priority because without them we wouldnt be in business. My co-workers have always been awesome. I get along with everyone and create a fun, friendly environment for each and everyone of them so when they leave that day they can think to themselves, ""i love my job."" I have always been more of a leader so taking on multiple task and acheiving them along with getting our team motivated is the most enjoyable part of my job and customer satisfaction."
good,Made and prepped all food throughout the day. Assisted customers with their orders. Stocked all areas and cleaned and closed Deli.
good,"The best part of my job is being able to help customers with feeding their families. I enjoy making my customers smile. I have been able to learn how to continue to operate in a fast environment. Managing other people can be a task, at times, when dealing with certain attitudes or gestures. At the end of the day I get what I need done while I'm on the job. My co-workers are helpful to me and I make sure that everyone pulls their own weight. I have learned how to better manage my time, deal with different issues, and work well with others. A typical day at work leaves the customer as the top person who's individual needs to be met."
good,Safeway is a very goal oriented company. Management was very efficient. The company seemed scrooge like in benefits.
good,"My management team doesnt schedule enough people as well as cutting back everyones hours. I get along great with my co-workers and have a good time ringing up customers at the checkstand. The only part of my job that has been unsatisfactory, is my management team."
good,typical Shift : 5am-2p or 2p-11p
good,I recommend you keep to yourself and just do the job you were hired for. On call never got called in unless a certain supervisor was working the other supervisors seem to call in as little people for extra overtime on there clock.
good,"Stalk,mop,sweep,trash,carts."
good,"i was a courtesy clerk so i would bag groceries for customers. i would clean up spills in the store and clean the registers. i would also gather up the carts outside and put them away. i would help customers put their groceries in their car. i would also pick up the garbage outside. i was in school so i only worked maybe 3, 5 hour shifts. Management was very nice and understanding. i liked the people i worked with. there were a couple people i went to school with that already worked there. i really dont think there was anything hard about my job. it was a pretty relaxing and fun job. i enjoyed it!"
good,"I provide a high level of customer service and practice safe food handling procedures.They bag customer's orders, assist the customers to their cars, assist customer to product location, sweep and mop floors, clean spills and damaged products, and provide other routine store maintenance."
good,Safeway builds a system to graduate employees from the point of sale all the way up the chain.
good,"receive merchandise on pallets, break down pallets, go to assigned area and start stocking shelves, assist customers when ready to purchase, check backstock for any merchandise needed, put codes on backstock boxes, input backstock into inventory, allign merchandise on shelves."
good,"Worked for the company for 3 years as a cashier. Found out quickly that the management doesn't see you as a person but more as ""tool"". They were very strict and condescending at times. The scheduling was very inconsistent and hours were always up and down. There was a lot of stress with the job, taking on multiple responsibilities and a lot of expectations with no appreciation. Very hard to move up in the store."
good,I liked everyone I've worked with at Safeway. Make working bare able. But the company expects a lot from you and everyone you work with making the job miserable.
good,"Come in, bag groceries, count can, doing projects management assigns."
good,I worked at the busiest store in the district at the meat/seafood counter. I had communication with most of the customers purchasing either meat or seafood as well as customers needing help finding items. There was a great rapport with all employees in that dept. I worked either day or night shift performing opening duties and closing duties. I did have a small problem with the general manager.
good,"A typical day requires ""your best"" from the moment you clock on to the moment you clock off. The ability to multi-task and to be constantly aware of your surroundings at all times is of the essence. No day is the same and it is very challenging to maintain consistency due the daily unforeseen occurrences and expectations. You will be challenged mentally and physically on a daily basis. Bring your ""A"" game!"
good,"Worked here for 3 years, was a head clerk, the company is downsizing so was laid-off"
good,it was fun working in retail shop. i have learned how to be patient with customers.
good,This job was best fit for high school and early college students. I didn't feel the opportunity for growth in the company was truly available to myself.
good,"If you need to work and get some money, it's an alright place to do that, it's unionized so you have people on your side, and the people that work here are good."
good,"At Safeway I have learned new things, such as making salads preparing sandwiches cooking different types of food and interacting with different people and customers who come to buy their food at the grocery store every day."
good,"Safeway is a good place to work, many of my coworkers worked there for a long time and seemed to be happy. I just think if you arent wanting to do the same thing every day, they have other departments for you go go to."
good,Its a fast paced environment and no room for advancement in the pharmacy department. A lot of regulations to adhere to which makes a pharmacy position difficult to maintain.
good,Good place to work but not enough hours I need something that offers more hours. Staff and management are good to work with. It is close to home. Hours are eight hour shifts just not enough shifts
good,The location that I worked at had hired too many people for the opening so a lot of the people including myself got our hours cut down to almost nothing.
good,"good company to work for. friendly staff and great customers. flexible work schedules. they closed all the stores in florida though, because publix bought them out."
good,"The work is easy, just stacking boxes all day, the thing that’s a little bit more difficult is keeping up with the minutes they give you per order. You have to be running all day to get your minutes. Can’t use the bathroom otherwise your percentage drops which puts you at risk of getting written up."
good,Learn to have patient and understand different life style and different jobs... being creative in different situations... must be completely flexible and dedicated
good,"Pharmacy is well balanced and manageable. The customers are great to work with and many of the other employees are also great to work with. There are times when we struggle, but we have made it out ok."
good,I love helping people making sure that they have the best day getting what they want and need pushing it to the length of satisfaction taking or going the extra mile
good,"Working at Safeway was good as a first job experience, but I wouldn't recommend being there long term. When I worked there, management had trouble communicating exactly what we were supposed to be doing/ what they needed us to be doing, and often it differed from manager to manager on what we were supposed to do. There was never a clear goal."
good,Fun and friendly place to work. Great people and environment. They work with your schedule and are very understanding. Take the time to help and show you the right way to do the job.
good,"There are many different departments with different managers, most are fair and just. And there is one that just is way way too ignorant to even be a manager, don’t call in to be late or you will get fired with this manager. By the way it’s the deli manager in springerville az"
good,"Hey man. its safeway. You know what youre getting into with a job at safeway. Management gets moved around fairly often, you work scheduled shifts, and your job duties can change all depending on the management currently in charge."
good,"SAFEWAY has a great environment, but their pay is insufficient.  I was commuting to the Bay Area from San Jouaquin County and the pay wasn’t worth the commitment.  It may be a good job for Highschool or College students.  Those who got paid well had been there for more than 10 years."
good,This job was a volunteer job through my youth transition program in high school so I do not know if it would be a good job to have for full time work..
good,"This review applies to the cashier position at Safeway. Over all it's not a bad job. But it's definitely not something that I would want to do for the rest of my life.The job is easy, but will get boring and tiring overtime. The more hours that you work as a cashier in a week the more your feet, legs, and hips will hurt at the end of the day. Breaks for a cashier at the Safeway in Springerville Arizona are not good at all. You get one ten minute break every four hours. You are supposed to get a half hour lunch at some point if you work eight or more hours in a day, but the management will usually only give you two ten minute breaks unless you are one of their rare full time employees. As far as pay goes it is a minimum wage job, and you will either not be able to support yourself, or you will have to live at the edge of your income. They are however a lot more flexible with their schedules and hours than a lot of other retailers. One other thing that I should mention is that Safeway is regularly visited by union representatives that spend a day trying to get new employees to join the union."
good,safeway has changed so much ever since it switched under different management. there are so much works to do much no support from staff and upper management
good,"Every shift it was something new to learn and handle, I got the hang of it including manager duties in case they were absent when needed, including western union transactions, lotteries or counting down the register at the end of the day. Hardest part would be a customer causing problems, other than that it was a fun place."
good,It’s ok I gotta a lot customers and self checkout isn’t the best to deal with and I also face and do a lot of stocking for the shelves but the managers are alright
good,Definitely room to grow. Any position in management is extremely stressful. Safeway holds high standards that are sometimes extremely hard to meet. With the limited hours given per department to staff with. Suprise audits keep you constantly stressed.
good,U have no control over the schedule they force u to give request days off but denied urs they tell when ur r allow to have days off even in slow times u get paid the same as the clerks to b a manager only incentive is the maybe bonus but u get to do 10x more than anyone in ur department even finish their tasks left over from their shift n if u don’t u get in trouble not them no disciplinary  action when major failure occur in ur team n u go under staff for months just to b given high wage clerks who can help u
good,"I learned a great deal from my time spent here. Mainly that retail was not for me. As a person who values a close customer worker relationship, that was not the environment provided."
good,"As a fuel attendant customer service and needs , especially Safety , are our 1st priority, I also handled high cash volume and security thereof , register handling , also fuel spill clean-up procedures , adherence to local and state requirements regarding checking identification  , and different types of payment methods , also fuel dispenser maintenance and preventive maintenance . There is hardly a better feeling than being attentive to customer needs and they ask to see your name tag to thank you by name ."
good,After prop 47 was shoplifting and petty theft laws in state of California was a touchy situation with corporate Safeway rather contract out because of the possibility of lossage overall pleasant job
good,Overall very poor at providing the hours needed to make an income. Even part time I got 4 hours a week which is nuts. I wish I could say different because I have faith in Safeway before working there but now I cant even go shopping there because I feel embarrassed for the company of their poor service.
good,Honestly working there was terrible the people working there running the place have no idea what there doing there or how to run a store my manager tried to fight me multiple times and constantly had a problem with me when i was just trying to do my job.
good,"Great company for advancement"
good,Being a cashier The hardest part was just standing still for the 4hrs awaiting break. The days can feel long and feet can ache if you're not wearing any comfortable shoes.
good,Early they were supportive and encouraging but as time and went and management changed less inclusive amd dont treat people equal and same rules dont apply
good,"had a good time working for vons, not enough employees for the tasks that needed to be done. Werent very flexible with time off. good people to work with though."
good,The job's okay. The management could be better. I wouldn't make it a career. The pay is minimum wage.  The environment is friendly and the employees are great people.
good,working at Safeway is a great way to get into the workforce but in the long run you’ll want to find something more satisfying. Some people might really like it depending on their position and values.
good,"A typical day at work is we are understaffed, nothing is ever done when I get into work. I have to pick up the slack of other coworkers. Management is not good. But, despite all of that I still do the best that I can with helping customers, my coworkers and just try to get my job done as well as I can while helping everyone else."
good,Its a great job may be for you may not. Hard work does go a long way with this company. You meet people from all over the world and get treated like family.
good,Productive and fun workplace with in a positive environment. encourage the employee to be productive and professional at all times.  Always understand that the customers are always right.
good,"As a bakery Clerk, I had a new experience within packaging goods and helping customers with the exact cake they wanted. I learned expiration dates and the correct packaging labels."
good,"Pros: Job security, benefits"
good,They are many employees but the pay is really not paid as well for all the things we have to do as employees. Other than that they are very flexible as a part time job.
good,SAfeway was great place to work. there is room for growth. Great flexibility for students. Physically moving makes time go by quickly. Pay is decent!!
good,"My initial manger was great but when she left we didnt have anyone for weeks. I was new at the store and had to figure out how to manage inventory on my own and it made things really difficult because I wasnt even getting paid for all the extra work I was doing. When the new manager came in, I tried explaining to her how things were going and she was rude and careless."
good,"I would not work in this type of retail job, I worked at the one on Mission and France next to a former funeral home in San Francisco, and the employee`s are great except for the management who likes to disrespect their employees by bullying and harassing them non-stop, and they are rude to the customers and racial profile them as well. But management always get moved to other stores very often you have to start all over every time, every manager wants things to be done in a different way"
good,I was opening checker at 5 am. I loved being a checker there and all of the customers. I also enjoyed working in the floral department on the managers vacation days.
good,"Safeway is a fast pace work place, they dont like over time or raises, they laid me off after I had mouth surgery and asked for days off cause I couldnt come in on prescribed pain pills and antibiotics to prevent me from getting an infection in my mouth. they cut my hours completely after my surgery."
good,"No advancement opportunities."
good,Worst job I was so bored good place to shop nice people nice workers wut ever I just like money they didn't pay much took too long to move up in there
good,"While the fast paced aspect of the job could be stressful, my coworkers were fun and supportive and made for a great environment. The Bakery manager was exceptional, and the lead decorator was a great teacher."
good,"A work day for me consist of very heavy multitasking, problem solving and  troubleshooting. I typically try to make sure the day run as smooth as possible. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing that the customers leave happy and satisfied."
good,"A typical day at Safeway included serving customers, processing orders, weighing food, stocking and restocking display cases, and cleaning the department. The best part of this job was meeting new people and learning different cultures in terms of what they eat and how they prepare food. The hardest part of the job was at the end of the day when things seemed to slow down. I prefer to have a busy day."
good,"Its an okay job, they have very flexible hours. Would be a great job for someone in high school or college. The raises are not merit based so as long as you show up you can expect raises at set times."
good,This job helped prepare me for my jobs to come. It helped me see both good work and examples of what not to do. The management cared a lot. Safeway was fun.
good,Its hard and they don't know how to treat there employees. I started out as a bagger then in the bakery which was good then they didn't even ask me but they moved me to the deli.
good,"Would recommend if you're looking for an easy job. Friendly coworkers, typically a nice environment. Enjoyed meeting new people everyday as well as seeing coworkers."
good,"A Typical day at work would be operating a cash register to accurately ring up our customers' grocery orders.  tendering multiple forms of payment while ensuring our customers experience a friendly, efficient checkout process.  Interacting with a high-volume of customers in a fast-paced environment ensuring that all of their grocery shopping needs were met."
good,"I only worked for 3 months there. My store manager did not seem to care about my mental health. I asked for shorter shifts and received 6 days in a row, over my finals, with 9 hour work days. No thank you. I dipped."
good,adsistent managers were good  enjoyed working with them. enjoyed working in produce and in grocery. meet a lot of nice people. kind of didn't like cash
good,"While I enjoyed working with customers and coworkers, management was not very accommodating and at times downright rude. I have a physical disability and was refused requests for shorter shifts, or to be moved to self checkout where there is more room to move than at a checkstand. My coworkers were understanding of my issues, but I could tell that management did not like to deal with me."
good,The work was very stressful and was not rewarding. Management was hard on the worker when it was not necessary and people would get in trouble for the little things.
good,"I would say most of the clerks are friendly, some managers are nice as well, but the store manager and my department manager are typical straightly-order followers. They don’t have much flexibility when you need to take leaves or so. And this job only pays minimum wage, which not really make sense to the workload, as well as the price of the product"
good,Had a great time while working produce ! Worked about 8 hours a day and management was actually great through-out my time but had to relocate to another state.
good,I felt absolutely awful at times because they kept telling me they could fire me for no reason and thay honestly crushed my morale and made me think of nothing but getting out of work for the day.
good,"Low responsibility jobs for low to mid pay. Great place for a first job. Plenty of management advancement opportunities, however if you go to management you should expect to work more than have a social life."
good,The company lacks employee appreciation in some stores but has good schedule flexibility and great benefits. At times the work load is too much because they lack employees to help.
good,"Working in a room 40 degrees all day..cold hands,and wet feet.working with wet product.Using sharp knifes.Making sure everything is done is quick matter.."
good,"Safeway will always be considered an extra income job. even full-time employee gets less than 40 hrs a week, good for college graduates and people looking for the second job."
good,"Work there was good, learned my great customer services there, learned how to treat people correctly, learned how to become a hard worker. Fun if u are a manager"
good,"Very busy in Deli department"
good,"Management is a bit of a mixed bag but generally the good people make it worthwhile. Very fast paced, very customer oriented. Be prepared to be constantly on your toes."
good,"This company is not a bad company to work for, it can be very stressful, but the people are great, I made great relationships with people... but they do expect a lot put of a person."
good,"It was more of a fast pace , and a get all the work done in one hour or we are not good enough type of job. It wasn’t for me so I am here to try to find another job."
good,Bag groceries. Clean spills. Collect carts. Management crew were nice and friendly. Hard part is getting all the carts in the parking lot. Enjoyable part is bagging groceries
good,"I was assigned in deli department. It was stressful because only 2-3 employees. it's not balance. It's always busy cannot finish task quckly."
good,"Early shifts starting at 3am. Heaving lifting, lots of fast walking. The job keeps you very active. The heavy lifting was the hardest part and bagging items was the easiest."
good,"If you requested a day off for personal reasons they were very judgmental about it. There was pretty much no benefits to working there, even the discount was small."
good,"I would still be at Safeway if they would have done something about the Bakery manager, she is the reason I walked away from my job.and I loved my job."
good,"During my time at Safeway, I served mainly as a produce clerk but also had the ability to work the cash register. The job was average. Nothing particularly interesting about it but I had to keep up with standards which taught me good work ethic."
good,"Terrible management, low pay, preferred employees. Untrained associates.  Inconsistency on the schedule.  Filthy environment. Not a good place to work."
good,"High production work place. Constant moving and interaction with customers. Baking and packing a variety of bake goods for customers. Operating and maintaining high quality machinery. From the many years at Safeway I have learned how to effectively manage my time to get the most productivity i can in the time that I am give. Really enjoy the preparing and baking of the different breads,cookies and sweet goods that Safeway provides. The work place culture had changed a great deal in the last 5 years production has increased and the staff decreased making it very difficult and stressful for employees. Management has a very hare time filling positions that are vial to the customer service aspect of the company."
good,"The job was cool, it was a job. I had to push carts, put back groceries, and clean bathrooms and mop floors. Managers were good when I worked here. I had to stop working here for school."
good,Was a good company to work for. The people were nice and always helpful and would teach you anything you wanted to know. The customer service was great very organized.
good,It's was ok I learned  how to use a scrubber and a buffer and cleaned the whole Safeway store it was a challenge but I did it.we swept around registers and cleaned and mopped bathrooms and learned how to spott mop
good,I worked at Safeway for a while and it was a nice place to work. the people I worked with were amazing and caring. the management were respectful and looked out for there employees. the only thing I would say that was bad about Safeway was that they didn't understand that someone with a chronic lung condition could not go outside below -10 because the person couldn't breath in it.
good,"Downhill since Sobey's took over, everyone left and work became considerably worse."
good,"What I mostly did was bagging groceries, swept floors, and cleaned bathrooms. I liked the job at first, but as the months went on, I started to dislike it because of dealing with bad customers. But that's just my personal opinion."
good,The people there was rude and I really couldn't work with some people there I only worked a month and then I quit that's all I got to say about them that's it
good,Making sure displays and other sale items are full at start of shift. Providing superior customer service. Training other employees on providing customer service as well as employees interested in moving up.
good,Working for safway had its benifts but i would not work for them again. I enjoyed my time but wouldnt because of my produce manager sacered me off from ever working there again
good,"A typical day at work consisted of collecting carts and sweeping up the store and maintaining a good overall experience for each customer. I learned time management, good ethical skills, communication skills and learned the differences between protocols for multiple departments."
good,"You put stuff back on shelves, bag groceries, clean bathrooms, take out the trash, and mop up after kids dropping milk on the floor every other day"
good,"I’m so sad to read about all the bad experiences others have had with Safeway home delivery. My and I have used this service for several years with a 98% positive outcome. Maybe it is due to our weather. Safeway delivery saved us many many times and we rely on their good service since we retired and have more than our share of bad days. Good luck to all of those living in cold climates, we retired here from Missouri and completely understand the difficulty of delivery issues in the winter months. Thank you Safeway for making many of us very happy."
good,Safeway is great place to start working if its your first job. You really learn a lot about customer service. I Would recommend safeway to anyone who is interested in working in a market.
good,Courtesy clerk is a very good starter job for those who are just starting out. Opportunities exist for those who want to stay and schedules can vary depending on the time of year and time of day.
good,"It is a good first job. But the company doesn't really care about its employees. If you just need a job to make money then I would recommend it but if you are looking for a job you are going to like, then I would look elsewhere."
good,I didn't like how they treated me as an assistant produce manger never did they want to promote me but yet they always wanted me to work as the produce manager... I left and never for paid for 2 months work as a produce manager...
good,Ok place not as good as Frys but would still work there if last option. Management needs a bit work but other than that everyone is friendly and nice.
good,Heard so many good things but learned otherwise. Looking for new employment with a company that has opportunities and does not hold you back if they feel they need and depend on you more than another location does.
good,"The Starbucks Manager position provided flexibility, but was very stressful. I enjoyed working with my hands and motivating others. Training could have been better, but learned to reflect and change from my mistakes."
good,"As a barista the responsibilities that were given; cleaning of kiosk, tending to customers drinks, taking out the trash, cleaning of all machines, and taking inventory of the food (looking at expiration dates). I learned a lot about time management because there were several tasks to be completed after closing. The toughest part about this job was being collaborative with some of the coworkers. The easiest part of that job was making drinks."
good,"Working at Safeway for about eight months everyone felt like family. You never felt unwelcome by the coworkers. But as for the upper management, it was extremely hard to talk with them as they never set aside time for their workers, and nearly impossible to get raises even for those who have worked there for over five years."
good,The place was alright to work at. They were always short staffed and i was always getting called in on my days off which was annoying. But management wasn't terrible and it was a good place to work at for the most part.
good,Safeway was the leader in customer service. The culture grew employees from within the company. The stores promoted a community focus. It has since been replaced with a bottom line financial focus that is destroying the best practices which was renowned for Safeway. The corporate mentality has removed the autonomy from the local managers. It has placed best practices in the hands of a group of people too far removed from each store to fully understand the effects of their time consuming paper pushing requirements.
good,"This is not a company to work for if you expect to live a lone or support a family. There's not enough hours the union is not very strong, there is a clique atmosphere,"
good,"I would recommend the positions at Safeway (Food and Drug), Inc. to someone who was a student. The typical day consist of a fast pace environment. I learned a great deal about cutting various meats with a meat slicing machine."
good,The biggest concern when working at Safeway depends on what kind of manager you have. I stayed for a while due to having a great manager that actually cared about her employees and gave us the time we needed off but I have heard many stories from friends where the managers are not all that nice.
good,Too many responsibilities for one person.
good,Changes things or discontinued offers or start new offers not updating employees training for pharmacy not good no set training department or someone over sees. Training and licensing credentials of new hires
good,"It's a job.  The worst part is probably dealing with customers who have little to no patience and respect for people who work for Safeway.  Management can vary; I had some good managers, I had some bad ones.  But the bad ones can really make work just miserable. "
good,Management would assign me a task but wouldn't train me how to do it properly. This happened multiple times and resulted in me spending an hour figuring out how to do something.
good,"liked being creative at the deli counter and dealing with customers. did not care for the management of the department as it was poorly kept, and changed hands several times."
good,"-A typical day is efficiently checking out customers while maintaining knowledge of prices and savings day to day. "
good,"Typical day at work included bagging customers groceries and using the cash register. Management is alright. Annoying part of the job is dealing with some customers with attitude. Job is quite easy, so anyone can do it."
good,"At first I was in Human Resources, I was promoted to Field Specialist"
good,"the hours sucked as you start at 4 am but other then that the team i worked with was fantastic! The first 5 hours typically you work alone, cooking and decorating the sweets for the day"
good,"Enjoyed working as cashier, interacting with the customers. Getting to know how customers shopped based upon their culture, and their willingness to share information on different items they bought. Learning the fruit/vegetable codes can be a bit much, but once you've got it - a piece of cake!"
good,I remember working for vons part time and and only for a short amount. It was a good beginning step towards later grocery store and retail chains. Not much else to say
good,Delivering food to customers all day in my work truck communicating with them about their issues on the order. Management will call you if they have a issue with the customer calling customer services. The people i work with where good people all cultures.Loading my truck and unloading my truck for every shift. Gettting off work!!!.
good,"Usually, the only person in the department and you're not going to get any help. Lots of work but not enough hours and usually they aren't willing to give you overtime or give you additional people to complete the work so it's a losing battle."
good,"Safeway is a kind of jb that would be for those who are still in high school, not for paying for college or ills in the house. although the management is good, they requested multiple task to be done by one person while others would slack off and do the bare minimum. the hardest part of the job would be to clean the whole store by yourself when all the other clerks called out sick."
good,"It all depends on what department is was working in that day. If i was in the deli, i would get there early, to get everything ready for the first shift. It all depended what department i worked in."
good,"In light of the recent expansion of pharmacist duties, patient care has suffered.  I love my patients but it has been difficult to provide them the attention they deserve with a increasing workload that is not partnered with additional ancillary staff."
good,A typical day for me is very much the same everyday. I have a list of things I need to get done each day and I do them. I have learned to move fast and get as much as I can get done in the amount of time I am given. Management is fine as long as I do my job. I like and get along with the people I work with. My job is not hard at all I just have to move at a fast pace. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. I enjoy putting a smile on there face and they do the same for me.
good,the store I work at was not the best representation of what the company was due to poor management and lack of management coordination. the job is mostly cleaning and working with the customers.
good,"Safeway provided a good opportunity for advancement.  However, it is a very stressful climb that requires a lot of overtime hours that you are not paid for."
good,Working in safeway somehow help me in highschool. It was really stressful working during fridays. They made sure underage people don't work for more than 40 hrs a week.
good,"Working in the deli is not an easy job, it never will be. However it is a good job if you want to be on a team with direction. There's always something to keep your hands busy even if the pacing gets slow and fast depending on the time of day."
good,The company was big on providing great customer service.  And would have daily meetings to provide feedback as far as how you succeeding.  Great feeling knowing how you were doing on a daily basis.
good,The employees at Safeway are all nice and generous people it makes for a quite enjoyable work environment. The managers at Safeway are always very helpful
good,"It is fast paced in the deli. Many opportunities to advance. Same songs playing all day. Good people there. They give good feedback and encouragement. In Duvall, WA."
good,Safeway had an uneasy way of communication with all teams because of past experiences. Therefore when I came in they had rules that didn't seem reasonable at all. Learning and helping in other departments wasn't something they encouraged which came as a shock to me.
good,"i love to help people carrying grocery bags for customers"
good,"Normally I would just move products onto the floor. Such as, cases of of water, soda, chips. Honestly, I didn't learn much at all at this job, except for realizing that I don't want to work at Safeway for a long period of time. The job was really easy, it just got boring fast. The best part of the job was definitely my coworkers. They were really nice people to work with."
good,"As my first job it was fine as it was, in the beginning hours were fine and flexible but as more time passed on and less staff was available I would go from having 25 hours to 40 for what was a part time job."
good,"Good job for someone just starting in the retail field. With more and more self checkout  there are fewer hours for cashiers, so a person might want to work in another department in the store."
good,"It is mandatory that you join the local union to work at Safeway---- something that I do not approve of since this ""drags"" down your hourly rate with monthly dues, etc."
good,cool place to work. you get your hours but you don't get much hours a week because they are over staffed depending on where and what safeway you work at.
good,"My typical work day consisted of ordering product. Production baking of  breads, pies, donuts, muffins, and cookies.  I learned and practiced the golden rule in the bakery.  Safeway is very diverse work place.  The hardest part of the job was covering unreliable workers positions while covering my own responsibilities in the bakery.  The most rewarding part of the job was assisting customers and providing  awesome high quality baked goods."
good,"Safeway had mandatory training classes for their employees, especially those in management. The chance for advancement was there if you worked hard enough for it. I did find however, they tended to rarely recognize their employees for their achievements, but were quick to be negative instead. The reason that I left was for better hours somewhere else. I was a single mom with young kids and they kept promising daytime hours, but scheduling me late instead."
good,managers at Safeway don't look at you as a person but as a number.  they use you for the number of hours you work and when you're out you are just another customer.
good,"very strict. they don't trust you at all, always had to put receipt on everything purchased and questioned about anything brought from home. Just do the job and enjoy the customers."
good,",  coustmers are good most of the time. co workers are great, fast paced and even when its slow you keep busy. not consistant hours and low hours off and on"
good,"My work involved constant face to face interaction with concerned customers. There were challenging times, but my training helped me to be a quick thinker and great problem solver."
good,I've loved my time working at Safeway. I was given the opportunity to cross-train in multiple departments and I really learned a lot in my 3 years there. This is a great entry-level position for students or someone who does not have a lot of work experience.
good,Work hard and accurately. Take advantage of union representation. Days go fast. Good discounts. Training for go getters. Can work multiple locations to increase hours.
good,I have to work with people who do not know how to effectively communicate. It is very frustrating. I do not recommend working here. It will not be a good experience if you are highly educated.
good,"My job at safe way was ok for a first job. i have no opinions otherwise. everything felt standard, hard at sometimes and fairly easy at others. i learned how to be responsible and hard working as to not disappoint my employer"
good,"the work is fast pace, depending on position. the deli department and bakery department brings food sometimes to the lunch room. If you sign up for their monthly fee which is like 2$ off your paycheck a month you can get discounted movie tickets and other passes for stuff. If you work part time and they call you almost always for closing shifts they expect you to respond with a yes. it's hard to call in sick because they expect you to take a ColdFX and come in feeling better."
good,Working for Safeway was a good first job experience. I wouldn't want to stay there though. It wasn't compatible with my Autism Spectrum Disorder. Other than that OK.
good,"If you like retail its ok. I was a bagger. So I had to learn the basics of packing groceries without making a mess. Management was pretty nice."
good,"typical grocery stocking job. put the stuff on the shelves neatly, be nice to the customers, keep your head down and work. thankless work environment,"
good,Larger company to work for. The are union but they are so large that sometimes it felt like you didn't know everyone. Not awesome for scheduling minors that are still in school.
good,My time here was hectic and stressfilled from.being told two sets of rules because I was a Barista in the safeway store. And trying to adhear to both rule sets was not possible as some rules and regulations clashed.
good,Work place culture was great. typical work day is about an 8hr shift with breaks. Management was always helpful. Most everyone willing to help out in all departments.
good,"Went from a global major supermarket retailer to a privately owned company with much smaller footprint. Cannot"
good,It was a good union job for a long time but very hard to get full time status due to union and store politics you can do twice the work but if somebody had more years than you they got the hours good pay and excellent benefits
good,"As far as retail jobs go, you can do far worse than this. Health benefits and 401k are included upon union membership, with the added bonus of job security. You can change your hours and job position with ease, and the work is not taxing at all. As a consequence, however, work days become very monotonous and it may become apparent that the meager paychecks do not justify working such a tedious job. Management is often uncommunicative and reluctant to implement changes such as equipment repair and ordering new stock. Look elsewhere if you're looking for a long-term job, otherwise you might end up trapped here with no bright future ahead of you."
good,"A grocery store goes through many phases throughout the day: the methodical yet fast-paced preparation, constant maintaining of products, waves of customers asking multiple things at once, the consistent cleaning. It all wears on a person's body and soul after awhile, if it weren't for the strong sense of community among fellow employees. We enjoy speaking about ourselves as we prepare products for customers, sharing laughs and encouragements throughout the day. The management does their best to be open-minded and understanding. Overall, the work itself is not easy, but we get through it every day just a little wiser."
good,"This is a job that doesn't require much of any real skills as most can be acquired while working, but although work became routine and so it became easy to go to work regardless of the early or late shifts i was working. Management was difficult to get things through such as vacation or time off, but overall friendly and semi professional workplace."
good,Challenging place to work. Loved my coworkers. Paid vacation and sick time. Good benifits flexible hours. Very busy and the holidaya and during the summer.
good,Hard to get hold of any management to learn how to do things required. Left due inability to transfer to busier location when not stimulated at current location
good,"It was a decent job, being a courtesy clerk wasn't the best but it could of been worse. Didn't like management but Co workers were good. Enjoyed working there for the most part."
good,Worked for 9+ years it has been an okay place to work.  Nothing really too exciting to say about working here.  I would recommend if someone needed a new job
good,I was responsible for taking out groceries and taking carts back into the store in an orderly fashion. It was a fast paced job and sometimes stressful depending on the situation.  Cleaning up carts in the parking lot during the cold was my least favorite.  Some of the people I worked with were great.
good,it was tuff because sleep all day because you work from midnight to the 8 am. but there is good in working at Safeway you get a 30mins to a 1 hr of brake with pay
good,Fast pace customer service then at closing and detailed sanitization operation. family type culture but leadership will not take responsibility for their failure and blame others for knowing what they were thinking and lack of proactiveness on management and schedule setting.
good,"I didn't mind my time at Safeway. I liked my coworkers, and my managers were nice for the most part. But good luck trying to get new hires. When our employee numbers went down in my department, I begged for them to hire new staff. The stores in the surrounding areas had 4 cake decorators in their bakery departments, while I was left on my own. This went on for several months. We had the occasional person swing by to help, but they never wanted to stick around. They always said it was too stressful. The ""Big Bosses"" came around quite frequently, and it was difficult to keep up with demands with no help, and without going into overtime. There's things you just aren't able to complete within an 8 hour shift and I wish more managers recognized that."
good,"Had an opportunity to work in many different departments, from courtesy clerk to stocking for dairy, liquor, and general store. They even have a graveyard shift, for people who want to stock the shelves during closing time. All and all, a good place to work."
good,I loved working for safeway but it was management whom I had problems with. They made me feel uncomfortable about talking with them about my schedule. I felt I was being picked on when I injured my wrist at work. The customers were great I was with the company for 11 years and never had any problems until my last year.
good,A great place to learn a trade.  They work students around their school schedules.  They encourage the young people to get an education.  A good place to gain work experience
good,Job is great for beginners. I enjoyed having flexible hours for I could work any shift available. Very straightforward and fun atmosphere. Could use a vending machine in employee rest room.
good,"I would have probably stayed with this company however, back in the early 90s they company decided to cut pay and being a manager was difficult due to all the disgruntled employees."
good,I took a pay cut. Because the company I worked for filed bankruptcy. They only gave me a quarter raise. I got a A  plus review!!I only received a 25 cent raise.
good,"average first time job for teens. a bit stressful. management is ok, not much training. I don't enjoy working here, but that's just my opinion. a bit mind numbing - not much critical thinking."
good,"For the pay and experience gained, it's worth working here. Safeway is affiliated with the union, so you get 2 breaks and a minimum 30-minute lunch every day, as well as benefits after working there long enough. There's opportunity to transfer departments, and the store is fast-paced and competitive, so it's a great place to learn and grow if you're new to food handling and looking for a place to build your resume and range of skills."
good,Typical work was a steady pace and good people work there. I learned of to make coffee. Management was poor at my location. A lot of zero communication and poor scheduling. I enjoyed my working with my coworkers and my regular customers.
good,This job is a good place for a high schooler just starting out and getting they're first job. They really try to work around your schedule or if your very limited to how much you can work.
good,"Good entry-level job that does come with customer service practice and organization. Can be stressful but managers are helpful. Overall, good first job."
good,"my job was to fry all doughnuts , restock the shelf in bakery area, go to the frezzer to pull out item, and to set up bagels muffins and cookies for the next day and clean up and the end."
good,"It is an alright job if you want a pay check.  I never worked in a deli and I never want to do it again.  Most of the time you are alone helping customers.  Basically, you have to run the whole deli alone and does get stressful at times."
good,"""Each to their own."" This was my sole takeaway after working for Safeway, Inc. My colleagues were more against each other than for each other, which was uncomfortable because I was neither for/against anyone. I just wanted to put in my hours to the best of my ability, and go home. I did not appreciate the workplace drama. It was highly unprofessional of my co-workers. I was promoted twice in the few months that I worked there, and my colleagues were not at all happy about that. It was pretty intense. I also worked the overnight/graveyard shift by myself, and the store did not have a security guard or any security equipment (e.g. anti-theft equipment), so that was pretty intense (and quite frankly, slightly terrifying) for me. I had to act as cashier, bagger, manager, and security all at once."
good,Loved working with my co-workers but management very toxic. They stress out the good employees but let the employees who never work and/or call out sick constantly get away with so much. The first few months of the job were nice. It was fairly simple and I was good at it.
good,Working at SafeWay is fun but the pay is just not enough to live off of. The other staff is nice and I enjoyed working there. I enjoyed enteracting with the customers.
good,"I didn't hate working here but customers are the worst. It' also a place were employees are constantly coming and going, so the general feel is that no one really cares. Not to say that they were never nice people but even the upper management lacked any personal connection or the barest hint of caring about their employees, unless they were particularly kind people."
good,"I worked there when I was 16. It is a simple grocery store, all tasks are pretty simple and low stress. The store carries a ""the customer is always right"" policy that was often abused."
good,Safeway is an okay company to work for. Benefit for managerial personnel is so so. There is little work and life balance. Most employees feel stress with work.
good,"About what you'd expect from a retail outfit. Somewhat the attitude of asking for the moon but giving you a bucket to get there. People are good, upper management is out of touch."
good,"Safeway worked very well for me as student, having flexible hours and being able to work part time. I learned a good deal of valuable experience, customer service being a good example."
good,"The work is what you expect to do in a grocery store. You help people find items, stock, and organize items. The best thing about working here is you get to eat food."
good,just make sure you actually do your job and be friendly towards the customers and the other employees then you should be fine. it can be very stressful but when everyone does their job its pretty relaxing.
good,"I went and collected carts, bagged groceries, stocked groceries, and at times would help the customers with their groceries. Also cleaned bathrooms, swept floors, changed garbages out."
good,"as busy as a grocery store gets there is always something to do "
good,"As far as the working environment it was comfortable but when it came down to it I was underpaid and taken advantage of. After taking there failing seafood department and bringing it to be the top ranked seafood department in northern california for both sales and customer surveys, i was only rewarded with no raise, being told seafood department managers do not receive bonuses anymore and finally having my total labor hours cut meaning i would have to work twice as hard than previously even i had drastically improved sales and food waste numbers."
good,"Extremely stressful with too many job requirements."
good,Learned that helping people doesnot cost at all.Management were good. Culture was good too. Too many customer but less associate to satisfy all. But i enjoyes the customers.
good,"It was an overall slow job and there wasn't very much room for growth, both as an individual and as an employee. It is a job more suited for youth looking for a first job."
good,"A typical day of work at my particular Safeway would be good to stressful depending on the circumstances. I hate to let people down and I stress myself out trying to be the best I can be. I am learning that I need to chill out and just do my best, if I have questions to ask them. There are some really good PICs at my Safeway, they heed problems nicely and do their best to work them out. Most people are easy enough to get along with, I have had some disagreements with some of my co-workers, but have tried my best to just let it go. The hardest part of the job is  sometimes I feel like I can't control certain circumstances and it frustrates to deal with them, then I stress because I am late to finish my duties because of an inconvenience."
good,i would come in and prep food then cook and serve costumers. weigh meats and cheese. i would also stock and take inventory. clean the work place and prep next shift
good,"The job is very easy. There are chances to move to different departments. Very peaceful environment and most managers are very helpful. The store does get really busy, but it makes time go by faster."
good,"Store is hard on Courtesy clerks, Store head seems to only care about bonus rather then quality of employees. Has problem even when employees leave and will still schedule them after the fact. Can't seem to keep other departments full staffed."
good,Love working with customers and helping them out. The manager are helpful too if you don't know the answer. It is a fast pace to work.I try to may all my customer leave with a smile on there face.
good,everything is just average. unwilling to give full-time employment status but more than willing to work their part-time employees 40 hours a week. could do better
good,Vons was not great. It's definitely an entry job which no potential. Vons take advantage of the best workers and let the lazy be lazy. Customers were truly amazing. That's pretty much it.
good,"typical day would to grab all the carts and put them in, sweep the store clean up trash in the front take items back where they belong, do all the go backs."
good,If you have ever worked in a grocery store setting they are all the same. Safeway was okay i just did not get enough hours. I worked at the one in Rehoboth Beach DE and the pay there is a little bit better than average
good,"Coworkers and immediate management worked well together. Company culture not positive, employees were treated as disposable and corporate seemed out of touch."
good,Wasn't there for long but in my time being there I have no complaints about the atmosphere and management. The benefits are by far the best part of the job.
good,i worked in the deli it was nice like your own island in the store it could get busy with customers but the most was cooking and preparing food and making shore the food didnt go bad
good,The work depends if your flexible. Opening is the best or closing. I learned it gets stressful and have to be well focused to detail and very high spirited meaning greet the customers in great attitude. Solve problems. definitely communication is key to not only customers but to team members to achieve your goal in a situation. The hardest part of the job is if dealing with a rude customer or your low on staff and have a lot of people that are need in help. the most enjoyable is meeting new people and interesting things at nigh shifts.
good,super over worked at the end of the day. i learned how to stock shelfs and check out coustomers from the check stand. hardest part of the job was getting carts in -40 weather. Their really hard to push and get stuck in the slush and snow.
good,customer service on a daily basis would be the most enjoyable part of the day.  everyday consists of new and challenging tasks.  Assisting customers with positive outcomes and looking for salutations to some concerns.
good,"Safeway is a company ran by corporate. Safeway is a great place to start working with customer service at the start of an early career. I chose to work for Safeway due to the flexibility while I was attending school full time. It is a very stressful environment as you start moving into the management team of the company. I would recommend this job to anyone interested in customer service, so they can get a feel of what to look forward to."
good,"It was generally a good place to work but for the amount of labor you put in, it didn’t amount to the pay. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to my fellow co workers."
good,"Depending on what department you get placed in, it will either make or break the experience for you. The pay is different in every department. They often keep employees on that are not good at their jobs or often leave the department for chunks at a time. Leaving the people who work hard to pick up the slack."
good,"Can make a decent living working full time here. Managers were poorly cooperative, did not communicate or relay information well. Somewhat lazy in laying down policies."
good,Safeway is an okay place to work I wouldn't recommend working at the deli customers are impatient sometimes rude and the store has a lot of thefts the employees are pretty cool and helpful manager of the store isnt really all that helpful and if you work deli and closing you dont get paid enough to do some of the work they give you but it's a pretty good first job
good,"I did my work, and my boss kinda just left me alone for the most part. It was a fast paced atmosphere, which made time pass quickly. the only bad part was some of the employees would drink on the job, and nobody cared. It felt upsetting that the atmosphere was unorthodox."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Safeway because of the people I worked with and the customers who were generally pleasant."
good,Managers were adequate although there were a few great ones. Inconsistent schedules can hurt. Everyone gets along pretty well in general you just need to have a quick pace.
good,nice fun place to work at the management ware nice and fun to work for not that hard to get days off if needed I liked that I got payed every week and the 1hour lunch break was nice
good,"a typical day in safeway I would make sure all trash was taken out from the shift before mine, make sure the restrooms were clean, retrieve carts from the the parking lot, clean up any spills in the store, and work any shop backs."
good,It was shift work. which at the time for me was good because I was taking care of my elderly parents. Moral was good.  I enjoyed the fast pace.  I looked forward to coming to work.
good,This was not a terrible company to work for. I worked here through college. They worked around my school schedule and understood when I needed to get school work done.
good,"The job itself wasn't difficult, but the staff and management made it difficult to work effectively because they're often stressed about something and therefore make the job stressful."
good,"Lot of work for small salary for a high cost of living area, when employees in other parts of the DMV area are paid more than in Virginia. Management not willing to work with the employees on disputes"
good,"Great company back in the early 2000's."
good,Working at Safeway was an experience I never forget.  The days were long and tiring.  Would never go back to work there even if they did finally give me a raise.
good,"A quick paced environment.  "
good,they are an awesome company but I was only contracted for a few months to fill in for an employee who had a leave due to maternity reasons. I got along well with everyone their.
good,Dealing with multiple people on a daily basis helps your people skills improve. resulting into you becoming a very social person. Having people skills helps you for career jobs depending on what career that is but most of them for the most part.
good,"A typical day at my work is getting carts, go backs, fill the cold case, fill eggs, milk, do carry outs, get things from the back to the customers, day stocks, do dairy tasks, cleaning tasks, do the bottle room( counting, fix the machines to an extent). The hardest part of my job is dealing with some of the customers."
good,"good team well oganized, lots of hours freinds staff and management, lots of hours and opoutunity great food around you all the time, when i was working for safeway they used to give us a %15 dicount"
good,"Too many different tasks, environment too stressful, low pay. The hours were mostly pretty flexible. The job often spreads you too thin, and seemingly expects you to be able to be in multiple places at once."
good,"Started as a ""Courtesy Clerk"".  Worked many different departments before becoming night supervisor.  No regular weekly schedule.  Hours changed regularly depending on sales numbers.  Benefits were great at the time, but that as over 13 years ago, I""m sure that has changed substantially."
good,Working for Safeway was good. Scheduling could get crazy at times do to the lack of help. They do have the right people staffed to train new and current employees. You must have and open mind and schedule before you apply knowing what to expect.
good,"Well for starters when I was placed there I was doing good in the mid morning shift.. but when they moved me to graveyard shift,  it was hard. Because I didn’t know where everything was and I was lost most of the time."
good,One employee was very rude and always had a mean attitude. No one was allowed to work on her cash register when she was working. Other employees were nice. They cared or asked how your day was or your children.
good,work is fun you meet a lot of people I enjoy the environment always try to keep busy fast paced and a great experience overall. I couldn't complain about anything
good,"Fun, friendly work environment. The job is never done. Must be friendly and willing to put the customer first. Open on all holidays. management is always willing to help you succeed."
good,"They have working environment and culture. We get to met different people every day. However, there's is a need to improve on customer service and management ."
good,day consisted of getting the meat department set up for the day packaging and pushing the product to the floor and customer service. was a good place to work but didn't like the union much
good,during my 90 day probation i was hired because  i had a spider bite that i was seen in the local emergency department where they provided me with documentation to prove i was there and why. the manager at the time named brian reviewed the documents and assured me that everything was ok and on my next scheduled day to work i came in on time and was terminated due to violation of my 90 day probation
good,Management sucks customer service sucks checkers are slow most Starbucks are not newly renovated so we don't have breakfast sandwiches which turns a lot of customers away
good,"The job itself is alright, just not what i'm currently looking for in a career. Dependent upon which location you work, it can be either extremely busy or completely dead."
good,"It was a great first job, the managers and coworkers were great and extremely understanding. Pay is definitely a downside, as they only pay minimum wage and I had coworkers who had worked there for 10+ years that had never received a raise."
good,Desent money for a while some stores had better managers the crew I was working with great bunch of guys easy job Iam very qualfied for the job I was hired for would like to work for them again
good,"If you are looking for full-time employment, this is not the company for you.  It is good for students, just starting out in the workforce.  It is a good job if you are seeking just a little monies to get you through to the next full-time pay check."
good,"The workplace itself was not too bad, but the structure of the store itself was kind of unorganized. Being that this was a store in a low income area, there were a lot of times when staff became overwhelmed."
good,I would recommend Safeway for somebody that doesn't have a family because they expect you to be there all the time especially holidays and weekends . The Manor management system is very disappointing and unless your buddy buddy with the management you're not going to get very far
good,"Job was very stressful always short of staff and staff never really wanted to do there job, very lazy always leaving things for other people to do."
good,"It’s a Friendly environment, schedules can be flexible, we have a  Union Local400 which comes with seniority. Good benefits, will work most holidays and weekends"
good,At the time I was working there I didn’t really have many complaints most the costomers were friendly and i was as friendly as possible to everyone and I tried making as many friends as possible
good,Management was always crazy and stressed. Everything else was fine but you cant fully excel in a job with poor management. I enjoyed my position but didn't enjoy constantly picking up the slack for others and then being expected to do more all the time.
good,I enjoyed on an associate level my job and the pride in preparing product for the customer. But I couldn't stand management and it wasn't meeting my physical needs or mental needs.
good,Working at Safeway was a temporary job for me it was a means to make income while I looked for better employment I was only offered a night stocking position and took the job because I had no other options at the time I did not enjoy my schedule (12am-4am/8am) but I worked it anyway for income.
good,not a bad job over night stocking job. this could be a potential carrier for a lot of people. one thing that would scare people away is the hours. the overnight shift could become overwhelming
good,a typical day at work include serving customers regardless if it is pharmacy related or not. There is a recent change in upper management and the culture of the company has changed. We do not have the freedom to act on market change in individual market in order to boost business as job security is a concern.
good,be a people person or you will not like this job.  pretty relaxed environment i always had a steady pace to my days.  management was easy enough to deal with and at the time the had pretty good benefits.
good,"Night Crew has to be trust worthy because you're left in a store with over 75k items and can easily not pay of items. Very little to no "
good,"I enjoyed working as a courtesy clerk at Safeway."
good,"Every day jobs were pilling up on one single person. Even though managers and supervisors were trying to appease customers by having speedy checkout lines, it took other employees away from their primary job of stocking up shelves and displays leaving little merchandise on the floor."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance- Flexible hours and break times."
good,Bakery manager was nice but there are times when he thinks that because he’s a boss he can do what he wants with my schedule last minute. Other than that I enjoyed working as part of the team
good,You can move up in this job to different departments if you stay task oriented while staying aware and work hard. Also recommended to have an open schedule if you plan to move up.
good,"The management needed a serious rain check, tons of people complained to the higher up and was told the issues would be addressed and the were left unattended. in my opinion Safeway lost a lot of respectable people who would've given them a lifetime career working for them; but the didn't listen and address small issues that grew and grew."
good,"not properly trained. good people to work with on crew, but when a hostile environment occurs it takes forever to get certain management to address the issue. poor follow through with management. especially working on nights, due to the fact that we never get to see management."
good,This company has a ton of potential but I had to leave here because we moved to a city where the only thing available is Albertsons and there is actually a big difference between the two. Seems Safeway has higher standards.
good,ok place to work 8 years ago do not know about now. Assist Mgr are under valued and over worked. Store Manager do not do nothing. Clean place to work.
good,"Hardest part of job is knowing customers and they pass away.  "
good,Would still work there if didnt need to relocate. It was a good work environment and really liked working fir the bakery manager and coworkers. Did not like the store director.
good,Typical day is stress full.  Scheduling is whack.  Department manager unable to set an example. Customers are nice.  Hardest part was remaining optimistic.
good,"I think Safeway was a great company to work for.  I do also think that the managers have a lot to do with your success with the company.  If you work hard and are dedicated for minimum wage, you will do great."
good,Pretty busy place at the Employee Service Center. Payroll for union and nonunion employees. On line classes and easy going manager as long as the work was completed correctly and on time.
good,"Overall, I would consider my time at Safeway to be a positive experience. Being my first job, pretty much everything was a learning experience. My duties included working the register, cleaning the store, returning product in the proper location, crushing of boxes and garbage, and stocking. They had me doing various duties, but I was primarily working the cash register. In terms of management, I would consider them good. I've made mistakes, including one or two ones I consider pretty serious, and yet, I was able to keep my job for how long as I did. Managers and people in charge were cool enough. I made some friends among my coworkers, but for the most part, you won't get to know many of them considering all the separate departments and people working within them.  Work environment, whether it be stressful and quick-paced or relaxing and peaceful, varies depending on the day and time you're scheduled to work."
good,Consistently had low amount of workers making everyone have to work jobs of 2 people and needing help or being behind in their tasks that needed to be done that day.
good,"Busy on and off, but it might be stressful if you often work alone especially during happy hour. First week of hands-on training was a bit overwhelming, but most coworkers were nice and would always answer questions. Closing shifts were sometimes a bit difficult, but manageable. Making drinks and serving them to customers was fun at least."
good,Come in late get to work unload truck loads break them down unload and stock then we race to be competitive then Clean up the trash from boxes sometimes we're done early and sometimes the load was to big
good,"I believe working at Safeway is what you make of it. I had ups and downs working at Safeway and found I was happiest working there when I threw myself into my work. Having organizational skills, proficiency, initiative, and willingness is a must in this company. There is much room for growth and opportunity if you want it and are willing to prove your credibility."
good,Safeway is an alright place to work. When i was there management was in a bit of turmoil. But my co-workers were good. Pay raises every 500hrs is a good thing too.
good,It was a great place for my first job. Never any drama and the customers were always a pleasure to be around. I was always ready to go into work because it was friendly environment.
good,Safeway was a lot of fun and payed very well for what it was.. within 3 years I was making 18$ an hour and started at 8.75.... at times it got very stressful and they asked for to much in a little amount of time
good,Co-workers were kind and willing to teach me a thing or two at the store. Always willing to lend a helping hand. Very positive and upbeat environment to work.
good,"Just like any other grocery store job. You cash people out, you bag groceries, gather carts, clean up messes, and stock things here and there. It was pretty simple other than the management at the time. The management has changed since then."
good,I feel that the Culture at Safeway was not a good one. You were forced to sign papers without reading them. No training after initial training and there was to much employees telling management what to do.
good,Deli work was stressful most days as you had a few cases to jump between and not enough time. Some customers were really rude and management would almost never regulate; the customer is always right.
good,"I had some really great managers that really helped me advance, but there were problems.  I left because something didn't feel right.  a few months later the Sobeys takeover was announced."
good,"Overall, my experience at Safeway was great in the way it taught me so many skills. The hardest part was standing the whole day/shift, and also the fast pace of rush hour, and sometimes the bad customers."
good,"courtesy clerk, retrieving carts from the parking lots ,putting them back ,bagging groceries, customer meeting and greeting, ensuring great customer service"
good,"The store I worked at was horrible"
good,Fast paced comfortable environment for anyone looking to seek a job. Can be stress full at time on holidays as you can imagine but nothing too much to handle.
good,"Safeway is a store in which you have the opportunity to explore what you may be good at, whether it be baking or meat cutting or front end cashing. I appreciate the training they provide."
good,"A typical day would be pushing carts, clocking sweeps, bagging groceries and cleaning up messes. I learned to manage my time very well due to having to crunch in two sweeps an hour and also learned to be strategic with having only an hour to get all the carts from the parking lot. Management could've been a lot better, they kind of threw me into my position with little training or explanation on job duties and got mad when I did something wrong that I never learned how to do properly. Employees were very diverse and helpful when I had questions. Hardest part of the job was pushing carts as pushing eight at once gets really heavy. Most enjoyable part was the health benefits and the schedule flexibility and discounts, although they only gave me 16 hours a week which wasn't enough to support my bills, which is also why I left."
good,Fast paced! Must be customer friendly! Must have good math skills! Team oriented! Must have positive attitude with customers and fellow employees! Product knowledge!
good,Helping customers and help keeping the store clean. I learned to communicate better with people. I struggled with managements lack of listening skills when it came to other employees treatment of me. I liked the fact that it was close to home.
good,Safeway is a decent start for a pharmacy tech. The pay and benefits are reasonable for the job but the lack of support from management can be disappointing.
good,I work on safewaydeli department china kitchen .I need to working hard and fast to comply my jobs.I word ten hour a day. I take two break each ten minute.
good,"weekly pay is great, but poor management and no real advancement opportunities. union but the benefits are not what they once were. you get $1 more on Sunday"
good,It is a fast paced service which I enjoy. There is always something to do. There are task that will keep you busy and consisted working till your shift is over. Non stop work and busy with customer service 24/7.
good,"Its a check stand job, not rocket science. You do this as your first or second job in high school or college, cant expect much out of it, you bag items, ring things up and sometimes collect carts."
good,"I got my first job with Safeway back in my teens. While I didn't mind and it served me well through high school, the corporate influence on some stores can be a strain. It can depend on location as to work environment, too! Enjoyed learning a number of jobs in a number of departments in my time with Safeway, especially the floral and bakery areas."
good,"i learned alot about healthy foods an different fruits an vegatables."
good,a typical day at Safeway involves stocking shelves and cleaning the isles. This is when you are not assisting customers or taking back any perishables or go-backs to the shelves
good,This was my first job ever. Didn't expect much from it and wouldnt do it again. Its great of youre just building some kind of experience. Its a very simple job.
good,Depending on my shift the job varies if opening make sure all the product is ready for sale in the counters as well as self service if closing making sure all dates are checked and clean up the department restock shelves for the following day
good,The workplace was fun and exciting during the time I worked here.  It felt like you were in high school with many colleagues that became life long friends.
good,I worked at Safeway for six years. The company is well run but they don't treat their employees too well. While working there I enjoyed the people I worked with but management was very strict and not very nurturing.
good,"While my coworkers were very nice the over all atmosphere was very stressful and poorly managed. We would have lines way too long and the back up cashiers and upper staff would be in the break room or wandering the isles instead of responding. This would make the customers irritable "
good,"Was a good place to work, got to know customers by name as they were regulars. New manager was just there to ride out the rest of his time before retiring did not much care about his employees"
good,loved my job and coming in today but felt like managers didn't care about employee safety or health. I would work their again but only if I didn't have anything else sadly
good,I am not sure about the how the company is now as I have not worked for them in a couple of years. While i was working there it was fast paced and stressful as you are dealing with people and food .
good,"Safeway was a tough job, but fair in other ways. there was many oprotunites to move in different positions in the store. the management was poor at the time and lack of communication."
good,Cool laid-back job just had to make sure you finished your deliveries in a timely fashion and not bring anything back to store the pay wasn't the best but it helped
good,I did enjoy working for Safeway and they were good to work for. This is more of an entry position in my opinion because of the pay and hours. I did enjoy this job and they provided a lot of valuable job skills for suture positions
good,"fast pace"
good,It can be stressful and exciting at the same time.  You have the opportunity to advance it just takes a long time and you have to ask about it constantly.
good,it was a great experience and I met some nice people and they were very helpful when it came to learning new things and the codes they were very helpful
good,Amazing work culture / fun environment where you can position yourself for success and really grow within your career. Everyone is very helpful and knowledgable. It really is a great company to work for.
good,Fun place to work good people great pay and benefits understanding managment very fast paced enviroment and very  competitive place to work and a great career oppurtunity
good,Safeway is a great job to learn how a retail company works and gives you great knowledge in products. I enjoyed interacting with customers and helping them.
good,"My first  years with this company were excellent. The pace was reasonable and as low on stress as it is possible in a pharmacy. I managed the employees, handle the paperwork required of a Manager, filled prescriptions, counseled the customers. I completely enjoyed the position until a new manager was hired and he did not like female managers. This was my reason for quitting."
good,"During the period of time that I worked for Safeway the management was not the best,  I was frequently yelled at in front of our customers who felt sorry for me afterwords. The jobs that I did were not difficult but due to lack of staff there was more pressure put on those of us who were there. The best part of the job was the customers; they were also the worst part of the job.  There were a lot of changes going while I was there which led to people being trained inconsistently or not at all which may have also led to lack of customer satisfaction."
good,"The company is going through changes, schedules are always changing the is no work/ life balance. The night shift workers are occasionally overloaded, due to lack of management."
good,"Management choses favourites, too afraid to call in sick, coworkers are nice and make work enjoyable, we all agree something in management needs to change.v"
good,"I started there right out of high school and worked 2 years. the pay sucked but the job was ok. I gain many skills and had a pretty ok boss. "
good,"The Social and International Development field of practice focuses on the social, cultural, environmental and economic conditions and developments that affect the well-being of people in Canada and internationally. In addition to problem analysis, we focus on interventions at the community, national and international levels: the work of social planning departments, community agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international interventions at the level of the United Nations and NGOs working internationally. The curriculum is built around the concept of social justice, reflected in national and international texts, with particular attention to contemporary issues of interest to social work practitioners, including but not limited to: immigration and refugees; the struggle for human rights and community development; the struggles of Indigenous people; the social implications of climate change, poverty and globalization; the work of truth and reconciliation commissions."
good,Honestly i would recommend this job strongly for anyone looking to better themselves i would go back and work here if i had the chance to do so the pay was fair
good,"Safeway was a fast-pace, customer service based environment. The best part of the day was the customer interaction. This was a great job to learn the basic skills needed to be employable."
good,it with look for karts and make sure the basket are back where they belong  and help other co-works boss is great i learn to work more by myself everyone is so different and it great talking them hardest part is try to keep on sale days enjoyable part are the thank yous i get from everybody it nice
good,"The pharmacy at Safeway was great. Schedules were relaxed and everyone liked working with one another. Benefits were only available if you were classified as full time, and many people were classified as part time."
good,Its a good job for the starting student. I had no complaints with anyone except my Department manager but this was a long time ago and i still see old co-workers from there.
good,"A typical work day would include interacting with customers and staff. "
good,"Customers would frequently swear and berate me. Low pay, lower amount of respect and appreciation, even from managers and co-workers. No real perks to speak of."
good,Overall decent company with decent benefits. Surrounded by mostly good hard working people. Mostly good quality products sold at fair prices. Not the best but not the worst company to work for.
good,"*slow and fast depending on time of day"
good,"Working in cut fruit (which is in the back in a very cold room) was fast paced, but a fun experience. I learned how to make parfait, salsa, guacamole, pico de gallo and many other delicious things. I had to properly wash, cut, package, and weigh a certain amount of fresh fruits and/or vegetables per hour before taking it out to be displayed for customers to buy. At The end of the work day my co-workers and I worked together to wash and sanitize everything in the room including the floor. If you want work hard and behind the scenes this job is definitely for you"
good,"Working at Safeway was a nice summer job for me while i was at home from school, Had great co-worker and very inviting for new employees such as myself. The only thing that was a problem for me and other co-workers was the management at my location. The management had no respect for staff members and was hard to communicate with."
good,I was in charge of ordering  stocking reciving loads writing schedules   orientations  training  new hires   checking     way to much on my plate  for the hours that the company was  giving me to perform my job
good,"A typical day at work was o.k. not really stressful"
good,Safeway is a good place to enter the working force if you are someone with limited work experience. Meat department employees are friendly and supportive.
good,"Was a courtesy clerk for a couple years. Decent starter job, it taught me a lot, and management gave me multiple chances to try out a variety of departments."
good,"Was great place to work, typical day worked fast pace, gratifying.           "
good,"not a bad workplace, quite a bit of drama between coworkers. management is okay. didnt mind working there other than not much room for improvement or moving up the chain"
good,Pretty laid back not too hard of work the managers could have been a little more professional all around. Super clique-y so be ready to make friends or be alone all day there is no in between.
good,"Depending on your location, you will either valet, self park, or both. Opportunities in working many different accounts and private events. Mainly youngsters but pretty decent people."
good,bit of corruption in upper management overall decent work environment. fast job advancement if you showed aptitude to learn the jobs and hard work. pay raise for long term employment.
good,"When I was initially hired, it was for a Food Checker position. After realizing my in-depth skills, I was offered to fill in as back-up Bookkeeper. That position came with management pay and status."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job- customers. The area in which I work is quite beautiful and the customers that come to our store are active, fun loving people."
good,"A typical day at work could be stressful at times but it made the day go by fast. Being an all purpose clerk, I was always busy, and I really enjoyed that."
good,"The location I worked at didn't really have the best management or scheduling. My experience was limited and in the end, I was let go, however, I feel that it was without good reason."
good,I used to work at Safeway many moons ago and I gotta safe it wasn't my best experience but hey it was my first job so I can't complain to much. But overall a great way to build a resume for sure.
good,"Answer phone for orders, balance the register at closing, order items that were running low, restock, and clean, check customers out at the register, and helped them with items they wanted"
good,Its like any other job... some people are really cool and friendly and some are bitter. At the end of the day you have  job that pays pretty well and a union that sort of helps if needed.
good,"It was a nice place to work and learn.. "
good,"slow work pace. union job and good, fair bosses. there isn't many bad things i can think about related to my employment with Safeway except that scheduling is strict if you want to get off too close to the date."
good,"The store offers a wide variety of food and goods, and the overall cleanliness is above average. There is opportunity to learn a variety of skills and trades."
good,"The union made this job worth it because it fought hard for it's members and made sure the pay they got was reasonable. Working in a store is rough on the body if you are a checker. You will hear the same thing every day ""If it doesn't scan it must be free"", you will deal with sometimes angry customers, and sometimes very shy or scared customers. If you like variety, and being active, go for a job as a checker. Safeway isn't a bad company to start out in."
good,Opportunities to move around to different departments and up within the company. Great position to have while in school. Flexible with hours for those with other commitments.
good,deal with customers good and bad and have to handle situation professionally. boss can be good and bad. with this job for people entering the work force a great way to develop skills on how to interact with people of all backgrounds.
good,You're acting so funny what's wrong billy? my doctor says I have skittles pox. Are they contagious? I don't think so. -beat- camera pans out to show that girl is now infected
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with at Safeway. One thing that drove me crazy was the way they decided the number of hours and shift that were available for the next week. We would be overstaffed one we and short staffed the next.It was definitely a headache to deal with.
good,It was an OK job for someone who's used to a fast paced environment. I wasn't used the hours and schedule  and the pace at all. I like to shop there though. Good prices
good,"Simple job for any high schooler wanting money, progression is possible but takes a long time, they dont give you a lot of hours for being a courtesy clerk but I took what i could get."
good,Union job with great benefits. comp is low and is time consuming to make raises in pay. Had an okay time while working there. depends on the location of a great experience.
good,"Safeway Inc was a wonderful place to work before Albertsons merger April 2015 "
good,nice place to work but the pay isn't all that well but the customers and the employees are nice people to get along with. The hours can switch weekly as well.
good,Its a good company to work and they treat their employees fairly. Work hours are flexible although its union so seniority is the basis for growth in the company
good,"So I dont know how things are recently but during my time I gladly kept to myself and rarely make returns to the store, its not the worst job but it was very odd."
good,"fast paced, taking care of customer needs, keeping departments up and shelves filled for the customers. Good customer service skills, being able to satisfy our customers, being able to work as a team player"
good,"Was a fun place to work. Very family oriented. Safety was a top priority. As an employee, I always felt my concerns were their concerns, Even though their fleet was older, it was very well maintained"
good,Working for this company is alright. Not the best they try and deny you for almost everything. I got fired because of no work left. They just took me off the employment with out telling me I was fired.
good,"This was my first place of employment and it was great for learning customer service and training in various other departments such as the bakery, produce or meat department. All my supervisors were great and willing to teach you so you can advance within the company and gain experience. In my area and during the time I worked there they even had a union which is a plus. The only downside was that the hourly pay rate was a little dismal and during slow times hours were cut. All in all I found this company to be a reasonable and decent corporation to be employed for."
good,"Night stockers refill empty shelves with merchandise, usually from around 8 p.m. until the early morning hours of 7 or 8 a,m. They visually inspect retail areas or read inventory reports to determine what to add, open and unpack boxes from storerooms and warehouses, and sort and arrange items where customers can reach them. If they discover damaged merchandise, they inform their supervisors or managers, and set them aside for repair or replacement. They must record their activities so inventory records are accurate and up-to-date. If stored inventories of items run low, stockers inform inventory control staff so items can be re-ordered."
good,"The original Safeway Incorporation was very productive and work was fast paced. All departmental managers were very knowledgeable with several of experience. A typical work day was very pleasant and stress free. Product sales were very good with excellent quality. Being in charge of the Quality Assurance Department, the highest legal and safe  quality of product were manufactured at very affordable price for all our customers. Employee turn-over rate was very minimal due to the professionalism and high hourly rate of pay for production employees. All production and quality control employees were very dedicated and committed with excellent pride in their jobs. Benefits were all intact, Medical, Dental, Vision  with stock options and 401K."
good,"At first as a pharmacy manager, I had the dream job. I knew all my customers by first name and they trusted me as a valuable source of knowledge and a health-care provider. I excelled as a pharmacy manager and was propelled into becoming a regional pharmacy manager. This salaried position often included me working 70+ hour weeks with little work-life balance. The culture is overall negative. Most Safeway employees do not enjoy their jobs and the direction the company is headed (less hours, more work)."
good,"good company to work for but wanted a new challenge by going to asda dont regret the move tho "
good,"Its ok, as a driver the work is not too bad, unless you are in San Francisco in which case it is a hard job. It is great to be by yourself delivering, this I really like."
good,"it was an ok place to work it had its ups and downs,i like the envroment i worked in. the only thing i dident like was the maniment that would keep chaning my houres on me"
good,"As a stocker/bagger, you are also responsible for collecting carts and maintaining the cleanliness of the store, as well as picking up after your coworkers in the break room."
good,"Great place to work but the salary its very low.  takes a long time to get promoted,  My manager was great but some of other managers were a unfair.  I would come back if they paid a little better"
good,"SAFEWAY...spelled back words, "
good,"This company is a great place to start as a temporary job but, it has no healthcare benefits or stable work days. Its just great as a source of experience."
good,"While working there i grew close to many employees. Management could be hit and miss depending on who you were dealing with, poor managment and a hostile work environment is one of the reasons i left my job there, my leaving was not plannedm i planned on staying with the company for awhile until things went south one day, with the things that were said from managment to me, i drew the line. You do not get vacation days or paid sick days, ect unless youve worked for over a year, they do provide insurance, but it isnt the best, you still pay a ton out of pocket."
good,"A  typical day is busy,  I have learned how to multi-task.  The workplace culture is friendly .  The hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule each week.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting people and helping customers that have problems."
good,"It was very laid back. i got to be my own supervisor. Unfortunately, we were required to take a 15 minute break every hour with unpaid lunches. it was a good job though"
good,I worked at Safeway as a courtesy clerk and did not enjoy it.  It was an easy job that anybody could do and is not that difficult.  It was simple but I personally did not enjoy it.
good,I managed a work force of 5 and served as a Barista. I learned how to make coffee drinks and be a successful manager. Management was ok there. Very friendly environment. The hardest part of job was not being able to get rid of bad employees. Most enjoyable part was working with the customers.
good,"Great job security and support from management, good work environment, management positions are demanding and require excellent time management skills for effective work/life balance"
good,"This job didn't have the management team required to thrive in a positive way. In a high-traffic, tourist area, this was not the place I wanted to spend my time."
good,"Many changes since owned by Sobeys."
good,"Customers can be really stressful and management is always trying to cut hours. This makes the job  hard because you don't have enough employees to help all customers, which can make them very distraught."
good,"worked on till "
good,This was my first ever job.. not the best job by far.. not many hours.. really slow most of the time.. co workers barely work. I really didn’t like working at Safeway.. was happy to finally leave.
good,"I would not recommend this job long term. If you're looking for a part time summer job then Safeway is a good start up place. Typically understaffed, moral of company decreased once Albertsons bought Safeway."
good,"Loved most of my coworkers, but could not get any assistance with customers or with replacing tills. Customer volume was extreme and rude. My other coworkers, whenever I asked them to assist me or do something for a customer, were completely deaf to my voice. At least my managers were more helpful."
good,"I think management needs to have more reasonable goals based off the people that they hire.  You cannot have one seasoned person in the deli, if deli employees call in sick, expect to train the baggers they decide to move over to help you during the dinner rush expect to be able to get orders out, carry out cash/credit card transactions, and expect the chicken in the oven to be calibrated and not put to the side because there are too many things going on.  Management needs to know in a situation like that if they are not going to jump in something will get put off for later to do just to carry out customers’ orders."
good,"safeway could have been better, including better hours, more items in the back room for spills/clean up, daily work was stressful,hardest part of the job was enduring the boss"
good,Day in and say out Safeway can be a very stressful place to work. They push employees to no end and for some including me want them to work 7 days a week.
good,"It is a typical retail experience in the pharmacy, a long task list and not enough people or hours to do it. If you have good management it is not as stressful, but when you have lack of management and coworkers that have way too many personal issues that effect their workflow makes the job stressful and not enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at Safeway would be, getting to work clocking in and going back to the bakery, first thing wash your hands sing the birthday song to make sure you had washed and dried your hands long enough, Safety first. Then help customers as they arrived at the bakery. check the floor to make sure there was enough product out for incoming customers to purchase at their will. Clean the cases, Package and / or bag product as needed to be put out onto the floor. Make sure to meet and greet every customer as they came through the bakery.Ask them if they needed help. If they did and it was in another part of the store you let someone in the bakery know that you would be back that you were helping a customer find a product in another part of the store, return to your station after the customer had been satisfied with their purchase. I am not so eloquent with words, I do my very best to say what I mean."
good,"meeting good people  wotking with good folks  able to help cud"
good,The work was not too hard but difficult and the co-workers made the team. However the Department Managers were not nice people. i was screamed at in front of costomers an co-workers.
good,The overall work environment was good in learning basic production and preparing skills. The best part of the job was working with pastry and sugar on a regular basis.
good,I was a gmc clerk I worked all departments and learned alot and I started off as a courtesy clerk. I made 10.00 an hour and when I was promoted I made 10.35 an hour .
good,"Possibly an easy job, employees are great and job management is good and hours are sometimes good basing on what type of work time you choose. Work hours are terrible during this time of year"
good,"Safeway is a challenging place to work. Never a dull moment. .It is great to get to work with the customers, and the employees are happy and work together as a team."
good,Job was as a courtesy clerk and it was minimalistic. Wasnt any room for growth and favoritism was played at the store I worked. Nto everyone got treated equally and people were akward.
good,"Been working in the Grocery industry for 10 years, would like a career with a higher salary long term. Hours range from midnight to 7 am starting. 8 hour days."
good,I haven't worked for Safeway in 6 years however for a first time job I loved it. It was a very friendly environment to work for. I would suggest this company to others.
good,management was okay for the most part but some of the customers we got were extremely rude and impatient. I learned that I don't really see myself being a deli worker at a Safeway.
good,you get to meet different people every day. theres always something new everyday working there . the past is slow the job is super easy anybody can do it if you just try
good,Typical day would be restocking shelves.  I only did restock so not much learned.  The management was very cool and helpful.  The hardest part was working late night.
good,It is a stressful and terrible company to work for that has only gotten worse since the merger. A lot of retail management are leaving and needs to be addressed.
good,It was ok. Although you do get a work out seeing how you have to go push carts and collect baskets. I really don't have any complaints other then the assistant manager was racists
good,"Deli work has its ups and downs. Some days were super busy some were slow. Working holidays was always busier than anyone would expect. Was trained to be fry cook. Cleaning the ovens, oil/grease traps, and even the roofs above, I discovered many smells that made me want to vomit."
good,Vons was a cool place to work when I was younger.  Great place to start a first job etc but I would not recommend staying for the long haul because you most likely will not make much money.
good,i learned many things while at this company. will be able to use in my future job endeavors. on the go and fast paced all day. hectic and unorganized.
good,"During my time at Safeway as a Manager I was responsible for maintaining the store to exceed expectations and making sure customers have a great experience. During my day I would watch check stand lines, help customers, stocking, counting inventory. Throughout my day I am making sure that every department meets all standards for customers to enjoy their experience."
good,I found the hours to be very flexible for part-time workers but there was no store discount and the health and dental benefits were not good for part-time workers.
good,"job requires you to stand for long hours doing somewhat repetitive work, good for a part time position while in school. pay is good and breaks are well coordinated."
good,Deliver groceries to customer locations as needed. I was only there for a month and was laid off. Supposedly for lack of hours. I enjoyed working there. My boss was wonderful.
good,While I was working at Safeway I enjoyed working with the managers and other employees and helping customers.  The hardest part of the job was trying to carry heavy boxes full of merchandise.
good,Lots of multitasking. Deli was often understaffed when I worked there so there is a lot of work to do. If I had the choice I would work as a cashier or stock clerk instead. Same pay but less demanding.
good,Safeway was a great place to start my career.  Learned alot about customer service and working various shifts.  Overall would highly suggest it for an entry level job.
good,"A typical day at work would be bringing in carts from outside, bagging groceries, helping people to their car with their groceries, cleaning, stocking and various other tasks as needed around the store. The workplace was pretty calm most of the time except during holidays. The hardest part of the job would definitely be pushing carts in in the snow. The best part of the job would have to be stocking or facing at night."
good,The job requires a base amount of knowledge around a computer. There is a lot of specialized training for the internal software and custom form of Windows. The atmosphere is somewhat relaxed but the workload requirements exceed the compensation.
good,I was successful in facilitating the consolidation of ten divisions to a centralized operation. Since my departure the company has been sold to Albertsons.
good,I enjoyed working there.  I made friends with many coworkers and only left due to pregnancy.  The only issue I had was that I had a small child and when his grandfather died I had to set a schedule and they would not allow me to do that.
good,To start it was an internship that lasted six months. With the help from Year Up Arizona I've earned college credits in business management as well as computer programming.
good,Working at safeway was a very intense but productive job. Patients needed a lot of help navigating the pharmaceutical aspect of their health and I was able to help them obtain that.
good,"I was a courtesy clerk, the job was appropriate for the time in my life as a high schooler.  It really didn't pay that much at the time, it was even below what minimum wage is right now, but paid appropriate for the type of work and how I was in life."
good,i didnt really like it because im the type to keep moving and i like active jobs that gives me a work out. this job didnt have that for me. so i would work there if i was going to school.
good,Any company that offers full healthcare benefits to part-time employees (20+ hours) is a great company. Definitely worth looking into. Pay could be better but it is definitely industry competitive.
good,"good place to work, if you need a job, always room for Improvement, been working for Safeway for 6 almost 7 years and it have helped me become the man I am today"
good,"This company is many things. Most of the employees are friendly and fun to work with and helps you whenever you need help. Although, the management however can be rude to their employees and treats them unfairly. Sometimes plays favorites to some of the employees he/she likes. The place needs some little organizing to be done and needs a lot of motivation for employees. Overall, I think it is a good place to start a job but I also think the management should be changed into something better."
good,"My co-workers and Managers were very patient & helpful when I first started working there, which I appreciated."
good,"It's a good first job while your in High School, but i wouldn't make a career out of it. I've learned a lot of helpful skills and valuable knowledge about the grocery store industry"
good,I really enjoyed working at Safeway before the buyout.  I do not know how it is to work they now as the were bought out and everyone had to re-locate and most had to take a demotion.
good,"Working at safeway was ok, but working at a grocery store wasn't for me. Very productive, quick paced, kept you busy. Good environment to work in, I would say the hardest part is when  the store is busy and it gets overwhelming."
good,I loved working with customers. I mainly worked the evening shift when the story was its busiest and I loved the fast paced enviornment. I also liked the weekly paycheck!
good,it was an acceptable job. courtesy clerk work is the grunt work of the store so be prepared to do just about anything and everything. the people are nice but you will work like a grunt
good,Good working place but i find the job as a service clerk as some kind of stressful and the pay to me isn't encouraging especially for a college graduate. Therefore an adjustment to pay and other benefits would be a nice form of incentives.
good,"Courtesy Clerk was an easy job, but when I was there the pay was about $9.57 without taxes and union dues coming out. Everyone expects a lot out of you even though you are the lowest paid employee there which doesn't make sense to me."
good,This was a job I had while in High School and during the summer. It was a decent job to have and it was a good experience and taught me a decent amount about customer service.
good,"Working at Safeway was a challenge during the busy times, but I loved my customers and did what I could to give them a good experience. I got along well with my co-workers."
good,"The pay and benefits are above average, even giving a fair amount of paid time off. However, the amount of work required by upper (out of store) management is inconsistant with the known amount of help/hours that were given to each department/store.  Hard work is not seemingly appreciated, and was often only met with criticism on other aspects that may not have been completed."
good,This job was just a job. worked graveyard shift  stocking shelves with other pretty alright coworkers. not much else to say. The hours were okay I guess.
good,Busy place to work. People can be friendly and helpful. They give 1 hour lunches. Which can be good when you have appointments. Some jobs can be demanding.
good,This is an average place to work with average management and average staff making for an average work experience.  Hours vary from week to week due to the part time nature of the job.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Safeway. There were times that it could get a little stressful due to customer requests, but I was able to handle what I was dealt."
good,"Since merger of Albertsons and safeway the company is not the same, everything seems to be micromanaged from above and frankly a lot of the expectations they ask for are just impossible and everyone knows it."
good,Got let go after my probation period was up . Discriminated but management for a disability i discovered in high school . Unfairly let go for a good paying job .
good,"no comment don't know -- consider to be confidential--  unregulated hours Monday thru Friday most management were knowledgeable about their position. Good sense of humor, diverse projects"
good,Great place to be at. Very relaxed but also at the same time quick paced . Non stressful when doing your job right. Very fun at the same time greeting customers and having great conversations.
good,"I need full time to support myself and I cannot get it at Safeway. I start between 2 and 3 a.m. everyday that I work. I work in a very cold environment/refrigerated. I learned how to make hourly employee work schedules, administer time appropriately, sanitize and clean the chopping room, etc. The hardest part of my job is the hours. The most enjoyable was the people that I worked with. "
good,The work is hard.  Been there over a year and do not have benefits. Big turn over. People dont want to to work. The people  I work with aregreat. Management has 2 turnovers since ive been there.
good,"Poor Management, once new management took over they changed the age limit to 16 and I was not 16 at the time. They did not want to wait until I turned 16"
good,"using registrars to ring up customers and helping to eliminate any fuel spills leaks or any other epa concerns. stocking shelves, cleaning pumps and organizing new products"
good,"Safeway brought to me much physical labor with a low hourly wage. If the wage was a little higher, I would be more satisfied. Co-workers were always polite and hardworking individuals."
good,Safeway is a good company unfortunately I do not know what it is like now due to the fact that they got bought out by Albertsons. Overtime was available . Working and repairing hot ovens was not that much fun.
good,"it was always busy lots of people shopping, in a cash register for most of my shift. It was an easy job just not a lot of hard workers. Management was good at the store."
good,"My typical day at work I would go in and stock the deli and frozen areas, and throughout the day I would prepare, wrap, and put out the meat for the meat department. It was hard at night balancing the amount of things that needed to be done because there were customers who needed assistance as I was usually the last one to leave if I was closing. The managers were friendly, if I needed help or asked questions they would answer me or try to help in any way they could. My only real concern was how late they addressed my reason for leaving.  I wish they had handled my situation more respectfully and promptly. All around it was a good job, aside from my few problems, I learned a lot working there."
good,"Working at Safeway was tiring. They always wanted you to do extra stuff that wasn't in your job description. Maybe not all Safeway stores are like this, but just the one I worked at and I have to hold managment at the time responsible for that."
good,"Had a great time moving from department to department plugging me in when I was needed, managers changed hands and it all went down hill. I tried to get transferred and was unable to do so. Being late too many times did me in, though I did try to relocate stores."
good,It wasn't the best job but it certainly wasn't the worst. When the company was taken over by Albertsons it really changed the mood of the company. It pays the bills.
good,"Welcomed customer with a smile. Personally cute and weigh any meats that the customers’ orders. Throughout the day cook all the hot foods and needed such as chicken, turkey, and vegetables. Make sure deli floor and counter is clean every night as I close. I dont think the job was hard but ive never cut and weighed meats and cheeses like that"
good,I really enjoyed working at Safeway. I had a great team and was very well appreciated as a hard working Front End Manager. I would have loved to stay and continue my career there if not for the for the need to relocate unexpectedly.
good,"A typical day at work for me includes stocking and taking care of the produce department. I learned how items are organized in a typical grocery store system, how inventory is managed, and learned of new food items that I was unsure about. The management and workplace culture is very laid back, perhaps too laid back for me. The hardest part of the job is making sure you know every detail about every item in the store, which can be challenging if you lack experience in a specific department. The most enjoyable part of he job is the free will to choose what task you want to perform at what time, as long as it is within reason and the work is finished at the end of the day."
good,"Wouldn't say I hated the job but I didn't necessarily like it. Management in my department never had what we needed. I loved working with the different types of cheese in ""CHEESE WORLD"" I can say i learned a lot about cheese. i also learned no matter how hard you work management stick together."
good,It's a good place to work at sometime's when you have rude folks in your line. That's when you have to learn to hold your tongue and you have. To learn how to deal with people and you still have to be nice.
good,Safeway was a great place to gather initial customer service and work experience. The management is helpful and if you communicate any desire to move up they will work with you as long as you show the desire and work ethic.
good,"-great staff"
good,"Spent 7.5 years of my life with Safeway. Was hoping for more advancement opportunities than there were. "
good,The hours that my manager would give me were bad and i didnt get a lot. also working in the Union sucked because half of my paycheck went to paying to be in the Union.
good,the store manager wanted me to fry donuts so with his encouragement I learned a new job. about a year later I became a baker. my best days were holidays lots of product made lead baker and I pulled it off together
good,"When I quit I was told that for a manager to be my reference they would need to go through hr and it would be a big ordeal, but it was my last day, so I just left."
good,Not the best place to work. A very stressful place to work and management is very poor. They allow minorities to obtain positions but make minorities go through he'll to keep the position. Many managers in major areas show prejudice behavior.
good,"Alright place to work. Compensation is every week which is good. the courtesy clerk job was more than what it is said. closing sucks! "
good,A typical day is very fast paced and challenging at times. The opportunity for advancement is there waiting for the right person. The jobs in management are stressful most of the times.
good,"I was a bag boy at safeway. in charge of getting the carts, cleaning the bathrooms, etc. It is a great first job. as a teen it does teach you the importance of doing things that you may not want to do but realize that it has to be done."
good,"Safeway was my second job. I have learned a lot from my first job but here at Safeway I learned more, I gained confidence and I knew how to interact with costumers. Safeway gave me the opportunity to get my Pharmacy Technician license and was moved from cashier to costumer service. I had a lot of fun here."
good,"Safeway is a good learning place for people just starting out in the job field. They care about their workers and treat everyone fairly,easy going and fun place to work."
good,"Safeway has a very fast work pace, job duties must be learned in less then a week. There is an expectation to learn, work, and complete the tasks at hand while atteding to clientel providing world class customer service. The hardes part of the job is not having a consistant work schedule, this will affect your personal life because it changes every week. The enjoyable part is working with people who love to work just as hard as you."
good,I worked at safeway during my college career for money on the side and was the hardest work there by far. There would be many days where i would be called in due to people not showing up. I was the first person they would always call but no site of advancement in site at all.
good,"It enjoyed working for Safeway, but I worked a lot and hard but just was underpaid for that little money they want to pay. I wouldn't go back not inless they paid a nice salary."
good,"H ad agreat time working at safeway enjoyed every minute,The hardest part was speaking on the announcer but was ok once you got use to it,Management were very approachable."
good,"As a whole its hard for me to recommend this job because of what i experienced in working for Safeway in the 11 years that i did. The management team i had at the store i worked at had a very bad mentality toward its employees. I witnessed and experienced a lot of favoritism and retaliation throughout the store. Our store had all the potential to be a great store, and a great place to work at, but because of management, and their treatment of their employees, it was hard for many people to show up and put in their best effort and enjoy coming to work everyday. Hard work and experience was constantly looked down upon as absurd as that sounds, while mediocre work and laziness was rewarded. The store i worked at was ran upside down, and as unproductive as possible. Because i worked at only one store, i cannot compare it to any other store, or experience."
good,"Learned excellent customer service skills, Great benefits. hardest part of the job was working all the holidays most enjoyable working with amazing coworkers,"
good,"i would still be working there today, the different weekly schedules threw my life off balance, i'm ready for a regular mon-fri set hours kind of job."
good,even though i didn't work there for too long but i still like the environment and the staff  there. nobody ever said anything bad or abusive. everyone was so cool about everything.
good,"i enjoyed working at Safeway. Great first job. Great for a full time student. I worked at Safeway as a courtesy clerk, produce clerk as well as a helper clerk,"
good,"Meat wrapper"
good,As a employee of Safeway the store was clean and management was available if you needed them for assistance. The hours were good for me as student. I enjoyed helping the customers and talking with them while still doing my job.
good,"It was okay working here. Management sucked but the customers were really nice, they were also understanding. I was payed well enough and the schedule worked with my school schedule."
good,"Overall, working at Safeway was a fun way to learn about a company especially as a courtesy clerk where not much people regard you. It is just that you are not seen really well by others because of social stigmas but overall it is a interesting work experience especially when trying to understand how an entry level job is like"
good,This job taught me to be a smarter planner. In the beginning I struggled to keep up with the workload and I felt over whelmed but the more I planned out my routine the faster I completed my tasks the less stressed I felt.
good,"A typical day requires me to listen to many customers questions and  give them quick concise answers. The management does a good job knowing when you are excelling, thus allowing you to work more on your own without being analyzed."
good,"There is always room for advancement in Safeway, the only thing that is a bummer is union dues, but those union dues give you pretty decent medical coverage."
good,Boring time consuming.  Every one in mangement hates each other every one is unfair to each other.  The union there is rediculouse and useless.  You cant get fired there but seems like all the workers want to be fired.
good,Typical day starts off by cleaning all the food cases and anything metal. Proceeded by washing any dishes left from the night before. Slicing and serving deli meat and cheese. Serving different premade dishes. Customer service job. Job wasn't hard if you have good customer skills. Loved meeting new people.
good,"Safeway was a solid company to work for until the merger with albertson's. lots of corporate change-ups that created a more stressful work environment. All in all, it was a good company to work for with decent benefits."
good,"Grocery business is tough,  the hours are long and you can expect to work many hours over the years.  Lots of people been around a long time at all levels."
good,The pharmacy where I work can be pretty intense. We do our best to do right by the customers while looking out for the bottom line of the company. They seem to be reducing hours when work load feels like it's increasing.
good,Safeway is a fast paced grocery chain.  Working here is can be challenging or very slow depending on what your job is.  It can be very tedious work with long hours.
good,Good starting job in the customer service industry recommend if you want to get to know the ropes and are looking for good people to work with and grow with.
good,It's a good place to work just has a lot of boss's  and too many people telling you what to do I lived working there but some people take it to far. The pay is good
good,"A good place to start your career and get your foot in the door. The schedule and shifts leave a little to be desired, understanding of course it is retail."
good,The job was interesting and good people worked there. However it was very difficult to get more hours. a typical week was only 12 hours of work. They did give regular pay raises although they were not very large
good,Management can be very distant. Customer can be very rude. A very physically challenging job. Not a lot of room for advancement. Overall not my favorite place to work
good,a typical day is making sure the store is faced up and in the good condition.  Doing our best to keep the lines short even tho we may not get the support that we want from upper management.  Supporting the staff so that they can give customer a great experience so that they shop with us again
good,"If you are new to the workforce and is looking for a job, Safeway is a good way to start off! They provide benefits, the pay is okay, and you have room to move on up. Whether you start off as a courtesy clerk, then become a checker or move to a different department like the floral or deli. You can gain great experience from working here. It teaches you to work on your customer service since you are dealing with customers on a daily basis. And it will really test out how you work under pressure when it comes to a crazy busy day and you are running around like a chicken with their head cut off."
good,"I started working at Safeway when I was 16, initially on a part time basis while I was still in full time education. It was a good team to work with, store management included."
good,"I worked for safeway over 6 years ago i worked as a Helper clerk stocking shelves, its a pretty average job not to much different from any other big stores."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be providing superior service to ever customer that I see while abiding  by company policies and procedures."
good,"Safeway is a good first job, truly taught me to work hard. It seems at Safeway like they do not care for you but at the end of the day they have to run a business ."
good,"Courtesy Clerk Pushing carts sweeping and bagging groceries "
good,"Safeway is a good place to work part time for high school students or younger, but the pay starts way too low for anyone older with bills or school to pay for. You start off with low hours and it takes years to become full time. The best part is meeting and working with lots of different people."
good,"Worked night crew for sometime and loved it for the most part, night management was great and understood team encouragement. Some of the main bosses views were misguided but night crew was great."
good,"Safeway is a grocery store. Working for Safeway is much like working for any other grocery store. Compensation was competitive. Employees are at times stretched thin, and overworked."
good,Unstable working environment. Not the experience one is looking for to further a career.  Lots of sudden changes which makes it uncomfortable and nearly impossible to adapt to your roll.
good,"Safeway is the second largest grocery retail in the US.  Eastern division operates roughly 120 stores in MD,  VA, DC, and DE.  Operations run out of Southern MD, and are disctinct from Pendleton, CA office.  This gives company more flexibility, and free run in their decision making processes.  Safeway is highly process driven with much emphasis placed on execution of corporate plans, as well as expectations."
good,"Customers are easy to help and work can become fun at times, however there is heavy favoritism and at times a disregard for seniority. Hardest part of the job is moving as fast as you can to get the job done because Safeway is afraid of overtime. Best part of the job is the always friendly coworkers, as well as many friendly and interesting customers."
good,Safeway is an enjoyable and productive atmosphere to begin training as a pharmacist and/or pharmacy technician. I would reccomend working at the pharmacy to friends.
good,"Safeway was a ok place to work I always loved to see my loyal customers come to my line and test me on how fast I could ring there things up, I enjoyed having to remember ups codes by heart."
good,"I worked as a courtesy clerk for Vons for a year. The work environment is usually fast-paced. Soft skills are helpful, but not required. The management was pretty good most of the time. Overall, not a bad place to work."
good,Nice job to have.... I would recommend... They are a union... So if you like union jobs than I am sure you will like this one as well... nice place to
good,With Safeway being a union office a lot of the time the rate of pay wasn't necessarily fair because there were no merit raises. So no matter how much harder you worked than your co-worker everyone still received the same rate of pay.
good,"People were rude, the hours sucked sometimes, always drama and somebody stealing. The environment itself was dangerous traveling to and from work. I enjoyed it at first but I began to hate it later."
good,I really enjoyed this job. The only reason I left was because a lady I was working with slapped me in the face twice & was not even written up. Didn't feel respected after that.
good,"Customer service was primary, work place sanitation was also high on the priority list. A typical day would involve product packaging, for our store and satellite stores. Stocking shelves with fresh product paying attention to organization and sanitation of the shelves and bakery cases. Assisting customers with placing cake orders guiding them to the best choice to make their occasion special and unique. I learned how to better communicate with various age groups. That being said management lacked in communication. Making the job difficult when supplies ran low or out. I enjoyed seeing the customers smile when i presented them with the cake they ordered. It made my day knowing they were pleased and i helped make there occasion special."
good,Safeway is a well known grocery store and will almost have you be busy. Management unfortunately had favorites and it showed with what they would let some employees get away with but not others. Connecting with the customers and havig them become your regulars was a great feeling.
good,"They are / have been cutting hours in all departments like crazy"
good,"A typical day at work for me involved coming in, tending to back room duties, dealing with customers, and then repeating that until closing. "
good,"Safeway was my first job as pharmacy tech."
good,"preparing beverages for consumers. Stocking inventory. "
good,clock into work with a identification number and went to produce to stock the shelves. management was helpful. the hardest part of the day was trying to help everyone out at once who needed produce and when you didnt have it in stock it was the end of the world for the buyer. the best part of the job is your employees.
good,"This job was my most enjoyable one after leaving the military. Management was awesome, unless you got on the bad side of it. I learned my best customer service qualities here. The hardest part is trying to remember what needs to get done for the day, because each day is different in its own way. The most enjoyable is seeing regular customers daily and making it worth the long hours."
good,I had a good time while briefly working here. The management was good and the employees were great and very welcoming. They made my time in Maryland great
good,I would back all the food and clean bathrooms and take out the trash and clean up messes that customers have broken I would push back the food it was like a family to me it was really fun and it was nice everybody was friendly I had a good time working with everybody I loved all the customers I was great with them
good,"Is a good grocery store, paid the bills going thru college.  Would recommend getting a job at a Safeway store to anyone.  Can work your way up thru the ranks with good work,."
good,"I learned how to work in a fast pace environment, How to handle customers and cash."
good,Nothing in particular is special about Safeway. It's a typical grocery store job filled with people who don't want to be working and where the managers are constantly breathing down your neck about something.
good,"Always busy, always had cleaning to do, always had something to do, managers were good, always kept you on track, and always had a task for you to do."
good,"I took the job just to earn some money over the summer. It was good practice for dealing with all sorts of people, and I enjoyed getting to know the other co-workers."
good,the job was very busy. I had multiple duties and responsibilities. the down side was that they changed managers and due to that I did not get the raise I was promised by the previous manager.
good,"Pays well, with benefits.  Your pretty much always working if you have open availability.  Most stores are union now so thats a plus, but just like any other retail job, customer service is number one, so if you dont like people, it probably isnt the job for you."
good,Vons was pretty high paced and the compensation was not the best. i did learn to improve my Spanish and definitely appreciate that! I had to leave Vons to care for my brother.
good,"can be fast paced during certain hours of the day, other times it can be slower and generally a relaxed job. Management is okay, no real contact to them other than co workers around you."
good,Can be a fast paced environment but can also be pretty slow with a lot of standing around.  Store management do micromanage.  Low pay at minimum wage and takes a long time to advance.
good,"The job was exactly what was expected, nothing more nothing less. You get to interact with customers on a regular basis and that helps the day go by ."
good,"Worked in cut fruit which was started as a test department. Small group of @5 people productively working as a ""team"".  Preparing cut fruit, vegetables and salads as healthy food choices for customers.  Packaging, labeling, inventory, cleaning and sanitizing are also typical daily duties."
good,"I think Safeway had good opportunities for what it was, I enjoyed working with others and being in a fun environment that was productive. I learned how to be a courtesy clerk and to gain more experience in customers service. Unfortunately, I did not get a whole lot of hours because of management's decision due to new ownership. I heard there were good benefits but I did not get any because of being part time. I put my two-week notice in to move and seek better opportunity. I would say for a short term part time job I would recommend it but in terms of long-term opportunity I am not sure if it would be a good career due to new ownership!"
good,"Safeway gives off the appearance of a hometown store despite its status as a rather large corporation. Each store basically remains in-house in all aspects. "
good,"Typical day at work: "
good,I enjoyed learning how to make drinks.  Rewarding day is when customers request for you to make their drink. under staffed had to run register and make drinks at same time.
good,"Got to work on time and do your job ,and your day will go by fast. It's a really good company to work for and it work with my  schedule as a person with  two jobs."
good,I like my co-workers and work well with them in my department and in others. I would like for the hours to be more consistent but they are flexible in that they will let you take time off easily.
good,"Safeway Good company to work. Workplace culture is a good team work. Hour as flexible with good benefits in 401K and Pension plan. If you work hard, you get paid more."
good,Not too bad. The front end management was okay however the higher level management was like a monkey fornicating with a football. They seemed to have no idea what they were doing and very unorganized. No overtime either even when you worked overtime. In general it was an easy job(cashier) but very boring and repetative.
good,very hectic and short stuffed. most of the time pharmacist has to do all the wor. no tech to help. pharmacist does all the work. hours are long and wait time for patients is short. Hard to provide customer service.
good,Answered phones to customers looking to resolve issues. Learned contact resolution in a call center environment. The hardest part of the job was letting the customer go without resolution of their issue. I wouldn't admit to defeat and never gave up on achieving their happiness while resolving the conflict. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with other people and making them happy.
good,"I worked for Safeway for 6 years, and I can say if you've got your head in the game the company has room for advancement. When I started with Safeway I worked part-time as a cashier and within 6 years I had run various departments and managed to become a store director."
good,"Management was ok to a point but then again when I needed to leave for a family member funeral was told I could not go so I left and found a new job. Got moved back to seafood department was happy at first but then started not liking it. They only had me working from like 4-9 at night or 5-9 at night. The manger back there not started being rude every day and making things up all the time but things that he says I would not do, even those I was doing them."
good,"The general Manager of the Dover Safeway was one of the worst people I ever had to work under. While he was bad, the assistant managers and the other staff were amazing."
good,"As stated above, it was alright"
good,"work production - the process of making bread from beginning to end - it's a fast paced environment - everyone works together as a team like on an assembly line"
good,"I loved working at Safeway because the customers were so friendly and the job itself was worth dealing with the poor management conditions. Managers lost my paychecks on multiple occasions making it so I was not paid on time. They have extremely poor communication skills and neglected to tell me about union dues and other important things. They were never able to honestly answer any of my questions, either. It was hard to learn the job duties."
good,"filling RX, stocking medication. assisting pharmacist. stocking mdication orders when they were delivered. completed my schooling and what I learned in school."
good,You would have to do a floor sweep every hour. They trained you on almost everything.  They taught how the customers groceries are supposed to be organized.
good,"Working at the Safeway location I worked at, there was a lot of customers who were drug abusers and there wasn't really any life work balance."
good,"It was a fine job for a minimum wage place. I did not love this job but there was nothing bad about it. The location I worked at had nice staff, they gave hours out based on seniority."
good,Good place to work at and sometimes management is a bit questionable at times. As well sometimes people are on call when someone is on a day off from work.
good,I enjoyed sprucing up the store with seasonal flowers and plants.  Management was always available to help.  Anytime I was having a bad day I could stop and smell the roses.
good,"The best part of this job was the ability to walk to work. If I had been able to move up though the company, or store I would have staid with the company longer"
good,Hard work and a lot to remember in training but once you're on the floor it becomes a lot easier. It was a great busy company with a lot to do. you'll never be bored. They could pay their employees more.
good,Working at a grocery store is for some people. I am not really one of those people. It wasn't a bad job and I didn't dislike it. It was just not the best fit for me.
good,"Management was ok at best. Don't know how the company is after the buy out. I was laid off because of down sizing. Went to work for Kroger after even though its the same type of company, they dont do much differently. Same bad enviornment"
good,"Always very  busy. Enjoyed interacting with the customers and my fellow coworkers. However, needs improvement on organization"
good,"I wasn't crazy about bagging and bringing in carts every day, but I learned about being fast and courteous.  I also liked working in bakery, but never got promoted from carryout."
good,"Take a minute to review Safeway."
good,A typical day at work is helping the cashier bagging items a customer purchases while assisting them to their vehicles for additional assistance if needed and provide special request when bagging specific items together. The hardest part of this job is needing to be quick as it is fast paced in order for lines to not be so long and frustrating for customers. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people you are surrounded by
good,It's a chill environment with plenty of different cultures. Not a bad place to start a job to get the experience and put it to your use. Its srevices are great
good,"Was an amazing work environment."
good,"Safeway allowed me to gain great experience in customer service. Although working with food was my main task, I learned more than I thought. Here in this job, I learned an effective way to communicate with staff and create a smooth working environment. The hardest part of this job was working with management, At my time of work, we were transitioning between managers which made the environment hard to work in and created poor communication, Working with Safeway for some time, I stepped up as a lead role to maintain a professional work environment as well as create positive communication. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing positive change in my coworkers attitudes and work, and making customers happy."
good,Working at Safeway was nice but it was a grind. It was very physical and tiring work. I feel like my education and wine intelligence was not utilized in the position. I spent more time with loading and unloading product than hand selling to customers.
good,you should always have good day and always keep a smile on your face. I learned that safeway be having great deals on there food.
good,I had fun helping other departments. Some of the people in management could have been nicer and more considerate. It was a bit of a distance between my house and my college.
good,I was working by myself most of the time when more things would have gotten done in a timely manner had I had one other person working with me on my shift
good,"Pharmacy team is experienced, dedicated and willing to compromise, but upper management does not compare.We strongly recommend getting the personal contact information for team leads and upper management in order to facilitate communication more effectively."
good,"Safeway is very good about keeping the store clean, and safe for everyone. There are weekly safety tips for all the employees that our safety committee members provide for us. We even have safety observations that everyone is required to fill out to ensure safety for all employees. Besides that, it is a very fast paced work environment, especially in the deli, where I work. I work as a closer so you have to know how to multitask because it's a lot to get done at night, in a short period of time. Everything is usually supposed to get done in about 2 and a half to 3 hours, and it does get you pretty messy sometimes. Management for the store and the departments is very good, they usually try to work with your own schedule to the best of their abilities, whether it's a school schedule or doctors appointments and all of that jazz."
good,It was great work environment. I enjoy it while I  was there. The hours were great. Work life and home life was okay. Safeway is now Sobeys. Sobeys has a different head office.
good,very fast pace hard work .I learned its very important to keep the  person happy and satisfied as they leave.making sure you the right amount of time to keep your custermers happy.when a simple smile and thank you make someones day alittle brighter
good,"Hours are good, M-F , on occasions must take 24-hour on-call shifts"
good,Great and friendly place to work.  Accomodating managers and flexible schedule.  A typical day at work involves receiving and unloading pallets of freight from trucks.
good,"Base pay too low but room for growth, union is great, management could use improvement. Consistant work for construction"
good,"The first two years working there were fine, but once year 3 hit the little annoyances really started to wear on me. It didn't help that the Fuel Station environment is VERY disconnected from the main store--left it feeling very isolating, which would have been fine with me if it had just been a little observation station instead of a kiosk, but when there's a hundred (often irritable) customers coming in every day and barely any contact with fellow employees, the little annoyances start to outweigh the relaxing aspects. Also not helped by the fact that I never got a raise in the 4 years I worked there, and never really felt comfortable asking for one."
good,Safeway was always busy and kept employees very busy with learning material and store standards. It did seem that they always had more expected of you and were short staffed which made customers wait time longer. They never gave a raise even after two years of full time work and that is ultimately the reason I left. The best part was meeting new people and having good conversation.
good,Typical day at work is cleaning and putting groceries back. I learned a lot about Safeway. Management is really cool and laid back. Co workers are cool and some are strict. Hardest part of the day is bringing in carts during the day in the heat. The most enjoyable is lunch.
good,From my experiences working here it was a very negative work place and they don't seem to value their staff much. There are many opportunities for job advancement.
good,"I didn't get the hours I wanted, management changed all the time, it was horribly ineffective with scheduling and managing control of its employees. I prefer to have a set scheduled, as I work better on routine."
good,The union is useless and terrible and gives bad medical insurance and benefits.  You always work holidays and weekends.  The pay is below average.  The people are fun though.
good,"While your day is filled with repetitive tasks they switch daily, hours are variable, otherwise an easy job. Management is usually easy to work with. Overall a good part time job."
good,The opportunities to grow within the company are not available. I enjoy the interaction that my position allows me to have. Working with other employees and customers makes each day better than the one before.
good,They wanted everything to be perfect even when i wasn't there.   Wouldn't give me enough hours to run department properly.  Cared more about the numbers looking good rather than employee health and well being.
good,"good retail food store.  competitive wages"
good,The job itself is not a hard one and is quite enjoyable most days. My only problem was with the other workers as everyone seemed to have nothing better to do than cause drama and blame their short comings on others.
good,"I have enjoyed my 35 years at Safeway but would like a position that is more balanced with my life."
good,"Learned good customer service, friendly coworkers, dealing with new customers everyday,the hardest part was remembering all the codes"
good,"Management was not the greatest, but it was a nice place to work other than that. I had great customers. Cross-trained in other departments for extra hours when needed"
good,I think the best thing about working for Safeway is the interaction with the customers. It brings more of a family environment to a workplace depending on the regular customers.
good,"I worked 10-20 hours per week, based on the store's needs."
good,"As a florist a typical day at work is wonderful, I love making arrangements and helping customers with whatever they need. My favorite part is when people come in and ask me to be creative and make something wonderful for their significant others. I get to hear so many stories, sometimes sad ones. Our flowers usually come in boxes and need to be trimmed and put into water. My dad consist of trimming and making buckets, cleaning, and creating lovely arrangements for people to buy. What is really turning m away from my job is the hours. I do not get paid a living wage. I only work part time because that is whats available, at $10.50 an hour. I am only guaranteed 24 hours a week. The schedules are weekly so its flexible but its not a job I can do forever if I want to live on my own."
good,I enjoyed many of my coworkers and customers; however the company's treatment of its employs as a whole was less than desirable to say the least.
good,"Got to meet good, fun loving people experienced working as a checker, floral, bakery and Starbucks overall it was a good place to work in."
good,I enjoyed working in a team with my coworkers and being able to depend on them just as much as they depended on me. I did not enjoy the the lack of communication between the employees and store management. I loved my job and it would have been a perfect job if it wasn't for the management. Management wanted to make it clear to us how much they didn't care about our safety and well being.
good,"Provide customer service"
good,"The Safeway Bakery its a great place to learn for all coming upstarts that want a career with Safeway or in the Bakery Field. Great Environment, great staff would recommend."
good,"Answering calls and assisting with info needed."
good,It was a good starting job for me. I learned to handle a lot and be more diverse in the store. Was a great learning experience. Provided superior customer satisfaction
good,There are the basic pharmacy duties to preform day in and day out. There's no coverage for days off or sick days. I have learned more into pharmacy inventory due to small staff.
good,"Raises were promised but were not received. The work was simple to do, though changes in routine and standards were weekly and not often communicated well. That being said, the people were decent to work with."
good,This job was a great starter job. It provided many employees with the opportunity to grow and/or work in different departments of the store.
good,Managers are often not willing to compromise. If you want to work only days there is not many hours to use. Coworkers are only out for them selves.
good,"Staff was often condescending and rude in my department. I always felt very rushed and underappreciated there. Since I was the youngest worker, I was often taken advantage of. Other staff members would push their responsibilities onto me, simply because they knew they could get away with it. However, my manager was a very nice person, and did well at his job. Work there was stressful and it often made me feel like not going back the next day, although I always did. Everyone in Estes Park hates that Safeway. There is always a lack of product, and plenty of customers complaining about it. Customers don't always understand that it's not personally your fault for not having what they're looking for, but the produce manager's. So the staff was often mistreated due to that fact. My leaving was however, not my choice. I might've stayed had the situation differed. I definitely would've said something to the manager had I had been there longer."
good,Have to work weekends and holidays no fun to work those days wants to find another job in the fine arts like to draw and paint outside of work wishes to be a professional artist
good,"open environment"
good,"Very little hours after school here and there. Helped ring out customers groceries and cleaned my area was a typicals days work. Management was okay, didnt really interact with cashiers too much."
good,"My store location (not necessarily the company itself) is like a light switch. One day, you're having a good time, enjoying work, wanting to be productive and on top of everything (on), and the next day you are unbelievably stressed, unproductive, overworked, understaffed, and complaint ridden (off). Nothing is consistent. Not how customers treat you, not how fellow staff members or management treats you, schedules aren't consistent, nor are the hours we receive. "
good,The area I work in has many hard working employees that are truly dedicated to making the best product they can. They are some really great opportunities there for a long term career
good,"Good focus on customer service"
good,"A unique environment with a strong team of employees, each contribution their own set of skills that form a second family away from home. From greeting and setting one another up for success at shift change, to compensating for each other's weak points to create an efficient system, management and employees always know how to make you feel like part of a tight knit group. Though at times the shortage of hours can leave you alone during a high volume rush of customers, it has only formulated circumstances that build your character up to the strongest it can be, making you both a more skillful and more adept employee. I have learned much about the food industry, how to interact with corporate level associates and customers, to expanding my knowledge and palate for a different regional coffees and cultures. However, corporate's involvement in the lower level management and bullying of our store manager creates tension between management and the hourly employees. This leads to a high turnover rate that leads to nothing but unproductive, disinterested teenagers expecting to get paid for no work."
good,"Excellent Customer Service Relationships and Communication.,"
good,"Stock team employee. Minimal thought required. Not challenging enough for me! The position required stocking merchandise. "
good,it is a good place to be when you need money to pay bills and take care of your kids and have fun with the money you have to do stuff with to buy a house
good,not the best place to work management was not to friendly co workers weren't as helpful hardest part was just keeping up when there was a rush not to much help easiest was learning all the food and how it should be organized
good,"Safeway was an honest job fit for working with High school level adults in which everything required low standards and expectations, with easy challenges. I would recommend it as a great beginning job."
good,"Don't make a career here.If you utilize it to your advantage it's a good opportunity .Student, retiree, second job  this is for you.NOT A CAREER.$"
good,"The staff at the Lafayette, CA Safeway will teach you the basics of working in both the food preparation and customer service.  There are legitimate promotion options for those who display the business acumen and dedication necessary required for a management position.  The culturally and experienced-varied staff understand the plight of entry-level worker, and will work with you if you are willing.  The labor union provides a quality safety-net for all workers ."
good,I gained a lot of valuable knowledge during my employment there. It was a fun and creative and generally pleasant place to work and my fellow employees taught me so much. I enjoy with people and find it both challenging and rewarding.
good,"A typical day working at Safeway consisted of being the only one actually working among the courtesy clerks. Regularly being called out to do carts knowing full and well that you brought them all in 20 minutes ago. Being moved from shift to shift on a whim. Speed trained in multiple departments for versatility, not productivity. Long hours, unappreciative management, and the pay wasn't great compared to previous labor intensive jobs I'd had."
good,"I had various job duties in the year I worked at Safeway. I helped all customers that came in with normal daily transactions, and I was solely responsible for the operation of the vault."
good,"Fun place to work if it's running right"
good,"Need more consistency with shifts and update their systems"
good,"Typical day at work primary revolve around providing support for Retail and Backstage Network support. Firewall, Load balancer, Router and switch changes and IP assignments. I learned a great deal about Checkpoint firewalls, Citrix Netscalers, Juniper Neoteris, Packet Capture and Analysis using WildPackets and data analysis with Fluke Performance Analyzer. My management team was very supportive and knowledgeable providing a great work environment. My co-workers are a diverse group of dynamic individuals each bringing a special skill to the team. The hardest part of my job is not always being able to solve a problem sometimes the issue turns out not network related. The most enjoyable part of my job is figuring out the problem and fixing it. There is a great sense of accomplishment you feel when you troubleshoot diagnose and repair an issue."
good,the work is fine and pretty easy but the work environment is not great. a lot of the employees are nice but do not give you any respect as a Courtesy Clerk.
good,"It was a great place to work, Enjoyed people i worked with. Always had a set schedule. Management was good. Worked grave yard shift."
good,Good benefits. They hire too many people for one position and that causes a lack of hours to go around for everyone. They also schedule outside of your availability for whatever benefits the company.
good,I enjoyed working there and the staff was reasonable. As well as management. The only reason I had to leave is that I moved too far away to get there in a reasonable amount of time
good,"My day delegating tasks, inventory management, order supplies, Breakdown deliveries, create schedules, filing confidential documents, train new employees, coach current employees, solve customer and operational problem, making drinks, attending to customers, answering some phone calls, deep cleaning, restocking, using a register. I have a department manager that I hardly ever see, so i tend to make my own decisions when it comes down to what to do with how things should be done for the day as well as guiding new employees how to their job effectively and efficiently. I became a department manager in malibu and the staff was far from trained, I self taught myself the guidelines of starbucks management. We were understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was my staff being very responsive and even though we were understaffed, they completed everything I delegated, and i enjoyed the chance to lead."
good,Packaged baked good and took cake orders from customers. My co-workers were very helpful. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to have a casual conversation with the customers.
good,Co-workers always great to be around and work along side. Always laughing and smiles whatever the day is like for work load.
good,I love to be productive and now I have forwarded through opportunities such as this to bring my assets to higher establishments.
good,"Busy work environment.  Company was in a great location near my home, I could walk there.  I learned a lot there and management was really great.  I learned a lot there."
good,"a very standard grocery store bakery. depending on the day and the stock, we will make bread accordingly. flexible hours and a very positive work place"
good,"I don't particularly believe in the shops that they paid customers to do, years ago. It forces fake customer service in my opinion."
good,"Safeway was great to work for 2 years ago, have headed slowly downhill since merging with Albertsons. I love the employees I work with, while management, doesn't always have your back."
good,"clean  warehouse , picking/packing, hand jack, fork lift, a team  player, available to Mon  to  Friday. hard worker,  valid driver ,"
good,"the job changes with the season, different programs are put in place to entice customers. "
good,"A typical day of work used to be working with one or two other people on the weekend and working on your own for three hours out of a four hour shift on the weekend. It changed so that one was working by oneself for most of an eight hour shift on the weekend, leading to excess stress and making time management difficult."
good,Waited on customers in a very small Kiosk... management was never around. Worked alone.. Hardest part was sticking gas tanks and having to bring stuff down from the store to put in the kiosk.
good,The customer's were funny and polite. While the employees were funny to work with except for one person. The scheduling was not put out fairly. The scheduling was based on a computer based scheduling by typing employees name in their computer system and giving out random hours that some people could not work on those certain days.
good,customers and co-workers were awesome. typical days at work were good for the most part. times could be stressful but you just had to roll with it. I learned to do what I needed to do to help customers and fulfill my job objectives with equal competency.
good,"I would start off by doing either cleaning, taking out trash, carts or bagging. Either of those and its an hour at each. I learned to never slack off and to just stick your job. The co-workers were nice and helpful and make you feel comfortable. The hardest part was carts especially on a busy day because you have to move very quickly."
good,"It was a really nice job when I first started, like all the managers are really nice. I've learned there how to clean and the difference in things and how to sort out things in a store and how to look out for thieves. My co-workers were really nice at first, they were fun to work with but then not really long, they act weird and don't feel like socializing at all. The hardest part was trying to figure out where to put things back in the store and trying to socialize with people because if I start talking with them, some will be okay talking while some don't. The most enjoyable part of the job is packing the groceries and help people out taking their groceries to their cars, especially old people."
good,"Union job, as an shopper for online customers, here I learned to shop, by analyzing  the quality of the merchandise before packing it up for shipment. This was at time challenging because shopping was taken care of by someone else in my home."
good,"I counted the cash in the tills from the night before,regular till pick-ups prepared the cash for banking."
good,I enjoyed going to work every day. I had very good relationships with most of my customers and coworkers. Management changed frequently but I built a good relationship with most.The hardest part of the job was standing for eight hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing people on a regular basis and developing friendships.
good,"Worked in meat and seafood department. Was a seafood manager for 3 of my 5 years there. I was one of the few women working in the meat/seafood department and I enjoyed working with men who talked candidly and were not thin skinned."
good,I wasn't working there long enough so I don't think it's fair to do a review. My short time their was enjoyable.Try it out see if you like it. Staff  that I worked with are still there so that must say something..
good,"Great customers"
good,My time at Safeway was busy and I enjoyed the interaction with customers. Staff were friendly and helpful. Management not always supportive.
good,"Fast paced job, easy if you know what you are doing and supposed to do. Most of it is just bagging and keeping the front end of the store clean. Sweeps and retrieving carts are scheduled. Only thing is favoritism, carts, sweeps, and hours are sometimes scheduled by favoritism, but it really depends on who writes it that week. It overall is a decent first job; difficulty of the job really depends which specific location you are working at. Same thing goes for management. Job is secure for as long as you don't commit an act that is justifiable for termination."
good,This was my job in high school. I had more knowledge of most of the departments then most of the courtesy clerks they hired but they ended up firing for a bad reason. Needless to say I was actually happy when my last day came.
good,You were always moving . customers were relying on quick and efficient service which was delivered consistently. The hardest part of the job was the occasional inclement weather.
good,"A typical day at work was fun, I learned how to interact with the customers, management was good, co -workers were helpful to be around, the job had challenging days but for the most part it was easy, the most enjoyable part of the job was engaging with the customers because I love working with people."
good,"Ringing up groceries"
good,"I found my positon challenging positon, however this particular store had poor management that completely failed to ensure that the work environment didn't feel hostile."
good,"The biggest difficulty is that (at the time), management, district management and corporate management were all on different pages, and tried to standardize everything. Every demographic is different, so there should of been a very few amount of things that were standardized."
good,This was my first job and it was a great first job but i did work their for longer than i expected. the worst part of the job was being on my feet but other than that it was fine
good,"Typical day,"
good,"This Job was mostly good, it was more about inventory from what i experience. The people where great. It also has its own Lunch room witch i thought was cool."
good,A day at Safeway is working with the public and interacting with the community one person at the time. Safeway is a changing company with many opportunities.
good,"My job included collecting the carts from outside, bagging customers groceries, and emptying the stores trash. Along the way i enjoyed interaction with my co-workers and customers."
good,"Helping customers with various tasks. Some but not limited to are lifting, moving, or showing where certain products are at. Also cleaning spills."
good,"Since I recently started working for Safeway, there isn't mush to say."
good,Co-workers are nice to work with. I have learned all aspects of being a Pharmacy Assistant. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction that I have been able to help someone.
good,"Safeway was recently bought out by Albertsons. As a result, Safeway is undergoing many changes in management and policies."
good,Great opportunity to work at ejoyed my co worker i learned a lot appreciative of my skills and good customer services. able to meet all types of people
good,"●	Directed and supervised employees engaged in sales, inventory-taking, reconciling cash receipts, or performed services for customers."
good,Great experience as far as developing new skills.  Customers were great to work with. Got along with co-workers. Managers are very understanding.
good,"I needed money at the time. That what made it so hard for me. It was something I needed. The days will be different at times. Sometimes I will clean all day and other times, I will make coffee all day"
good,Safeway is a great place to start a work history for a first job.  They strive to work around school schedules. They work with you to make the best of your availability.
good,"what a rip-off, i was shorted on pay on every paycheque in 3 months. management was less than proffessional. it was not a pleasant experience"
good,"It was a fun work place. I enjoyed helping with customers, however I felt that the wage was a little bit lower than expected."
good,some huge potential with this job just need to be patient and invest years into the company to work to the top of the union senority list
good,"For starters there are long hours and not enough staff to cover, schedule continually changes..  Needs to be more focus on success of company and employees."
good,great place had no problems working there wouldn't mind working there again learned many things in the business also taught me plenty as an adult like the what to do aqnd what not to do
good,"I really did enjoy working with the employees at Safeway.  I learned alot from the Cashiers and the Bookkeepers and the other management staff."
good,"I worked for Safeway for many years,I mostly liked my job ,although it was hard work,and  often difficult dealing with that many customers,I had great benefits while my kids were growing and i moved up to a nice wage,Its the kind of job that demands a lot from you.but it can also be very rewarding in feeling like you have helped your customers and did the kind of job that you would expect if you were the customer.I am like family with some of my co-workers as ive known some of them for over 20 years.Safeway management,i dont feel is very understanding for real life issues of their employees,but,im guessing its a way you have to learn to be,when you run a big business..I would still be working for Safeway and retire from there,but i have some injuries that keep me from doing this kind of work anymore.Finally I would say i enjoyed working for Safeway ,but now i need to find a new career."
good,"A typical work day for me was as a courtesy clerk. I was the closer, and I had a to-do list. It was the same tasks for 5 nights a week. I learned valuable job skills, for it was my first job, and I got to develop more as a person. Management was very relaxed, especially if you are inclined to converse with them. However, mess around too much, and they will say something. The co-workers were a varying bunch. Most of them were immature and often gossiped, and I often paid no mind to them. The most difficult part of the job was having a set agenda for my night shifts, and having it constantly interrupted by the front end service department when they would call me to bag. The most enjoyable part of the job, last but not least, was being able to have balance between your necessities in life, and the priorities at work."
good,"I enjoyed the work, the people, and the hours. Management was flexible and friendly, the pay was competitive and my fellow workers were decent upstanding folks."
good,"Nice place to work, and a great for some one to advance in their carer or work. I liked working with all the other employees and I also"
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. The most enjoyable part of this job was working alongside my colleagues and learning, teaching them."
good,"On a day to day i bagged groceries , collect carts , and sometimes cleaned the meat room , the co workers were pretty easy to deal with"
good,"As a courtesy clerk, I bagged groceries, took carts back and cleaned various departments in the store. I also helped customers find items when necessary."
good,"You run out of things to do quick. They don't have efficient scheduling, and the managers are quite rude. I like the people I work with but the customers are rude as well. Very rarely is there a customer with a good attitude."
good,"I love working for this company, unfortunately I have reached the point where there is very limited room for advancement, and with the company merging job are not as stable as I would like them to be."
good,"Safeway used to be a top of the line company in its industry. Now the company has struggled because it has lost its identity. It competes with every grocery store in the market instead of identifying itself as high end or low end. The result is a constant change in policies and the company being sold. It used to be difficult to get a job with Safeway because the employees were taken care of very well. This was offset with high expectations and higher prices. The quality was the best in the industry. Now the quality is low and the employee standards are low. The prices are still high unfortunately and it drives the customers away. Until Safeway decides it either wants to be Wal-Mart or Wegmans, and commits to that decision, standards in the company will struggle and the employees will struggle along with the company."
good,i was here for two years it was a union so the benefits where great there was room two grow but i found something better and decided to leave
good,"Vons was a great place to work, but they're very strict on their policies and don't tolerate mistakes. The most enjoyable part was getting paid every Friday. The least was putting carts back in their proper place on hot summer days or cold winter nights."
good,"When run at the store level, things were quite ok. It's when Corporate decides to implement worthless policies and practices that things start to go awry. You have 8 hours to get 10 hours worth of things done, and Corporate piles more on top of that, then wonders why that stuff wasn't done. They are disconnected from their employees on the store level, and it becomes very frustrating when you're trying to get your job done."
good,fun work place with supportive management. not all about the number but more about the team and employees. decent amount of money and great work hours.
good,"Though my co-workers were nice and comfortable to work with, the benefits system was shoddy, the hours and the pay were little or rarely in balance, and I've had lasting health issues because of the position."
good,"Served customers and many closing duties, like cleaning and taking out the trash. I learned to run a register & how to clean thoroughly. Safeway management wasn't always useful or kind but deli management was very helpful & coordinated well with coworkers. Coworkers were helpful & friendly. Hardest part was doing closing duties alone. Most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers."
good,"Working in Deli Safeway is fun. Dealing with different kinds of customers everyday is cool, seeing diffferent personalities & attitude makes my work more challenging. Co-workers are very easy to deal with."
good,"Safeway is a great place to work. However, if I was a store manager would I run thing differently ? Yes I would. I believe that in a Retail World you listen to your employees as they are the first line of contact to what customers desire and want. What I have noticed is that is not being done. Proactive is better than reactive. However I am over qualified for the current job that I have."
good,great company lot of room to grow. many new stores and lot of new jobs. I would work for this company again. the customers where always friendly and nice
good,I enjoyed working there and I enjoyed my customers.  I loved taking care of their needs and getting them out in a timely manner.
good,"Since I've worked at Safeway Starbucks, I've learned how to do ordering, inventory, how to prepare coffee/drinks in a fast manner, as well as a ton of customer service. I get along with all my coworkers but working with all girls can result in unnecessary drama which I try to stay away from as much as possible. Management is filled with nice people. The hardest part of the job was making drinks fast and memorizing all of them but I've got the skill down completely without trouble. I enjoy making coffee because I'm good at it and people interaction."
good,"At this company I maintain an outstanding customer service as a floral designer. I not only was in charged as the second in command in our department, but helped with the monthly inventory. Help with customers and maintaining department organized and fresh. Keeping up with duties of everyday multiple tasks with loads and maintaining out are clean. Cash customers out and help mentor new floral hires."
good,"Troubleshooting and repairing store network and retail systems."
good,I am not going to dignify writing a response for a company I still work for.  It is not in my best interest to say anything that may come back to haunt me later.
good,The pace is very fast and can become stressful at times.  the training is not thorough enough to lead to being successful.  The deli employees are a good bunch of hard working people.
good,I had a great experience dealing with customers and food handling. But when it came to management in the Deli department it wasn't that great but I was a great worker and I did the best that I could do.
good,I learned how to work in several departments along with what happens in those departments. The hardest part of the job is getting time off that you want to have off. The most enjoyable part of the job involved working with friendly people all day every day.
good,"its safeway, great place, was like being back in high school at some points. i worked hard got my job done in the meat department and went home"
good,"Works you to the bone. Pay is nice though. Union. On call only. Lost a bunch of weight though and gained a good amount of muscle. Most of the supervisors are funny and nice, the manager not so much."
good,"A place that kept me busy every day. I was responsible for several tasks and patiently walked through them until I was able to successfully complete them on my own. I loved completing everything I had planned for the day and sending customers home with the arrangements they wanted. After my manager left due to an injury, it got more and more difficult for me to manage everything in the floral department by myself. Everyday was a challenge and I took pride in what I accomplished."
good,"I worked at the Safeway off of 74th and federal in Denver, Colorado. This store is extremely busy all the time. which makes it a difficult work environment. Which is why if you can get a better job, I would. However, it was an extremely good opportunity as not many other work environments are available for a high school student. I feel as if I can not offer  much as too an honest opinion of Safeway due to my stores busy atmosphere. The only thing I saw in particular that was not right was that as a courtesy clerk, I often was not able to complete my responsibilities because I had to cover for there not being enough checkers scheduled."
good,At this job I made sure that all the carts were in the store at the end of my shift. I bagged customers items. I also stocked all items. I did the cash register every now and then. It was an ok jib fir the most part.
good,"A good place to work,Ive learned a lot from working at Safeway,most people do not understand how a store runs!There are a lot of good employess and some that are not. I just like to do my job the way it is suppose to be done keep quiet and go home!!"
good,Friendly workplace which made my day much easier. also had some complaints from customers but as a team myself and my coworkers would take care of the problems professionally.
good,"Worked 11-pm to 5am before people were in store. No communication or real team work. Left my report of tasks completed in writing, with occasional feedback from management. Fortunately I work well with no supervision. Pay was fair for tasks completed."
good,"It's a overall good company but the people that worked for it killed it for me. People with power that shouldn't have power. I learned a lot from safeway but still didn't get me anywhere I am today. Management wasn't the greatest. My job wasn't hard at all, maybe dealing with the public was the worse. My enjoyable moment was clocking out."
good,with the merger of safeway and albertsons there are a lot of things changing and in turn it is making it harder for the employees
good,"A typical day at work would be slow one part of the day and busy for a short part of the day. I've learned a lot at this job, considering it being my first one. The management isn't so bad, the supervisors know how to do their job but sometimes they aren't just on top of things. Co-workers turn into team players and you grow to appreciate each other. The hardest part of the job is only dealing with difficult customers while the most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer happy."
good,"Hard overworked day with no employee help. District Manager, Store Manager come in and wonder why things are not done. Then provide how they would have done it."
good,Wasn't the best job I ever had but was some additional income. I remember driving the van one day full of hot soups and I had to stop urgently on the traffic light and guess.. all the soups were all around the van :)
good,Always something to do. Paid weekly with good benefits. The management is about as good as a grocery store can get. Older co-workers were nice for most part but some were straight mean and control freaks.
good,"I would push carts clean the store stock the shelves and bag groceries and help customers. I learned to talk to different types of people. Management was okay they need improvement. My co workers are nice but some need a push to do their jobs. The hardest part of job is when others slack I have to pull their weight but I can still handle it. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I help some one because at the end of the day what matters is customer service."
good,"Facing items, unloading and reloading carts. "
good,it was fine to work there but  it was the employees that made it hard to work there. It was hard work and fast pace. The other employees did not want to work they wanted to make somebody else work and they stand around and talk.
good,I learned that the customers come first and to always follow the rules. most co-workers are very nice. hardest part of the job was nothing. job was pretty easy. management is cool.
good,I enjoyed working at the Starbucks that was located inside the Safeway. Coffee is a very fun business to be in and you get to talk to tons of people daily.
good,I learned a lot while working for Safeway. They are very hands on with teaching you everything you should know and more. With classes for advancement and promoting within the company. Was refreshing to see.
good,"My first retail job. Loved it. I started as night crew for a year and ended up in Produce for the remainder. My co-workers were always enjoyable as well as the management. The hardest part of any retail job of course, was the customer service. you can always do more to make their day better. What i found most enjoyable about Safeway, was the knowledge and experience i was able to achieve within a few years."
good,A typical day at work I would water the plants. Except and sign for orders display flowers and other things sale flower arrangments. And make my costumers feel special.
good,"Safeway's corporate office was not a bad place to work--lots of good, friendly people, pretty good benefits, including a nice on-site gym.  With a few changes, it could have been a great place to work.  There were many interesting challenges and opportunity to learn new skills if you were willing or capable of learning them on the job.  "
good,"Great first job while in high school. It taught me the basics to customer service and how to be a professional individual. Typical job duties were stocking the dairy, grocery, deli, produce and meat department. Taking customers to their car to unload groceries, as well as gathering carts."
good,"A typical day at more store was most times was filled with being in the register, being harassed and ridiculed by customers, and back and forth moving from stocking to cashiering at a pace that would rack any bodies brain. I have learned to be able still communicate with irate customers even if their belligerent. The hardest part of the job mostly was dealing with the customers, in the area I was in the customers tend to be aggressive and potentially violent."
good,"Always maintain a smile, good hygiene, and work fast. The store managers are always on top of new things and once something changes the store is pretty quick on picking that up and making proper changes. My managers always treats me with respect and considers my ideas even though I am just a clerk. I enjoy work and all the extra incentives provided by my store manager. Our store is very organized and clean. The employees all look happy , and sometimes this is very hard to find in a grocery store. Overall Safeway is a great place to work. It is very upbeat and happy environment."
good,The management was accommodating to scheduling needs and training was adequate.  There were good managers and poor ones so a day's outlook varied by who was in charge and that was disconcerting.
good,"Struggled a little here but moved up so fast. So many opportunities to learn and move forward. Its a great place to learn and then take somewhere else."
good,What i loiked about safeway was i had what i needed to do basically on a list and i paced myself and made time for my own lunches and breaks.
good,"The employees were great. Great benefits if you can adhere to some of the policies. Managers are hit and miss, some good , some terrible. Secret shoppers in the stores all the time evaluating customer service. Most customers were very nice and it was no problem helping them. You are expected to work weekends and holidays, trying to get time  off to attend functions is very hard. Some managers will bully you if you ask for a weekend off. The union is not much help. The CEO is a very cold man."
good,"Silverton Safeway is a well run business. They are efficient, clean, and customer friendly. They do not however seem to understand the importance of caring for their employees nearly as much as they do the customers. Many employees would have their hours cut, and then the store would hire on a whole bunch more newbies and throw the whole system out of balance. No one can get the hours they need, even if their income depends on it to care for their families."
good,My job is pretty straight forward and I have it down after a few years. My co-workers make my days go quicker and help me get my work done in a timely fashion.
good,typical day at Safeway would be to stock a cart full of produce and put it out on the floor. Loved working there but needed more hours then they provide me with.
good,"A usual day is occasionally busy with customers, allowing time to pass quickly. I learned the value of customer service and efficiency of providing quick service. The management is usually inconsistent of control, and while most of them are kind and understandable, others just don't provide you with what you ask for, even when you go out of your way to cover a shift. "
good,"I was once told when entering pharmacy that you never get to finish a hot cup of coffee or a conversation. This quote I found out to be very true. "
good,there are no guidelines in daily supervision on what is to happen on a daily timeline.there are basic job functions to be completed and a planned daily routine is always in place but daily adjustments in labor and job functions occur
good,The hardest part of this job was getting the management to accept no as an answer after an already overtime filled week. I liked how the job flowed.
good,Dealing with customers and dry cleaning garments & textiles.  learnt how to deal with chemicals and industrial machinery.
good,This is a great job for people who needs a part-time job for someone going to school or has a full-time and needs another part-time job. Pay is a little more than minimum.
good,"fast paced, precise and time crunching. Taught me alot of customer skills and how to deal with customer problems. Management was strict but fair. Besides the rookies, most veterans were willing to help you. Hardest part about the job was balancing your home life with work. Best part was the family atmosphere we had with our co-workers."
good,"Did not work there very long, due to cut backs in 2009."
good,"Part time hour, full time work.  Management do not care about the employee. The hardest part of the job was management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I learned that my customers is the most important part of the  job.  They bring out my  ability work hard."
good,A typical day consisted of thoroughly cleaning the kiosk. Preparing food and beverages for the costumers and recognizing the regulars and remembering what is their usual.
good,I like safeway it was a good job to start out with. They taught me how to deal with customers. the only thing is that they didnt give much hours
good,"I worked at the Safeway in Towson, MD for a little while. I was not satisfied with my job at this location. I found that the management was not always up to par. I worked in the deli section and I felt that it was not kept clean enough. They also did not do a good job with hiring others when they fired a few workers. I felt that there were times when there was too many things to do for one person. I tried my best to get everything done in the 8 hours I was given, but there were times I stayed longer with no pay to get things done. Overall my co-workers were good."
good,Company has been acquired so they are starting with the bare minimum support staff and my position was eliminated. Knowledgeable and hard working coworkers were great to work with.
good,"It had its both ups and downs to not have my management around, considering if something went wrong overnight it was very difficult to get a hold of someone with the correct information needed for the matter at hand."
good,"Up date with Supervisor or lead for daily routine and start your day."
good,"a typical day at work would be proofing the weekly circular"
good,This company was slow paced mainly due to the fact that employees had to work with outdated technology and processes.  Employees were easy to get along with.
good,Come in and get the shelf/ counter all set up for the customers. What I have learn from working there was I have to keep moving and not break until the job is done.
good,"It was one of the hardest jobs I ever had. Turnover at this store was insane, they could not keep a full time store manager, Closed its doors to Craig, Colorado"
good,"I start a list of what we will need for that days production. I have learned that you need to learn your employees strengths and weaknesses, and use those aspects in the right way. I deal with store management through out the day,getting input on various aspects of the job. The hardest part of the job is maintain a balance with all the employees personalities,so everyone gets along. The most enjoyable part of the job is the learning new things and teaching them to others."
good,Structured work environment. It was a great place to start out.What made this job most enjoyable were the people worked with and the customer contact.
good,"Great place to work."
good,"every day at work is different I get to deal with many types of people and their situations. I have learnt to deal with certain situations that come my way."
good,To get experience into retail and learning more about yourself. I'm just writing more to fill up the quote they require me to

good,"My immediate co-workers are fantastic and have helped me to grow greatly.  I have learned a ton since my start in the finance department at Safeway and am confident in my abilities to grow within the finance world. "
good,I enjoyed helping people..The management was nice and so was the co workers.
good,A stable job. Management is fair. A hard days worth of work. Hardest part of the job is standing for long periods of time.
good,"As a public company too much emphasis was placed on attaining short term sales/profit numbers which consistently hurt the needed long term strategic initiatives of an evolving EDLP market.  This combined company Safeway/Albertson's will soon sell off many of its divisions and further consolidation of the supermarket ""market"" will continue. Once Norcal/Socal Vons is lost to Walmart/Kroger due to Pricing issues, this company will rapidly crumble as Cerberus turns it's profit from it's initial investment."
good,"hours were good, never got a vacation for the five years i was there thank god , i still got payed for it. training was good learned a lot there"
good,It also requires the ability to remain calm under pressure but it was rewarding to share achieve goals at work.
good,"A typical day begins with returning phone calls, going out into the field to complete investigations"
good,"Bag groceries, help customers find certain items. Stock merchandise and help other co workers with any problem they may have."
good,"I worked here for two years,. I lived close by to the store at that time. There are lot of people who worked here, are stressed out due to pressure from the management and the corporate , needing more productivity but not giving enough time. A lot of people are skipping their breaks because of it.  There are couple of time that the whole store employees got written out because we did not write down our weekly safety thing. We simply did not have the time.  Several managers and night crew supervisors eventually got demoted because of productivity. While I was there, we had 7 night crew supervisors and assistant night crew managers changed within a year. Also within that year, almost 1/2 of the entire store staff got hurt because they are always in a hurry to get job done. I do love my co workers. We all worked as a team. I also had night crew supervisor and assistant supervisors who come in drunk unable to do the job , so morning comes, both will tag team and got people fired one by one. The only way to do the work is to work off the clock, which a few of us start doing. Those who are willing stayed. I am a workaholic. SO I am willing to work more, I stayed on the good side , I volunteered to do the cashier since nobody wants to do it. I love the customers, I am a people person. Because I am a workaholic, I was given more hours to work for a newbie. I volunteer to anything new. My pay got risen quite fast because of it. In the morning when the Cashiers arrived at 6 am. I don't get off till 7;30 am. I volunteered to give them breaks before I clocked out. I feel bad for the managers"
good,"Okay to work for"
good,Boss was friendly and always willing to help and teach new skills.
good,Dominicks was a wonderful company to work for. We were a group of people that were a family and all worked together to make this company our own. Many of my coworkers had worked their whole lives at Dominicks. Customer service was the number one priority for the employees.
good,Highly focused on providing outstanding customer service and providing extensive training to employees
good,good job to retire and be stable. not alot of money. fun working enviroment.
good,working at Safeway was nice to learn to work in different areas. working with managers and hands on.
good,It's always a joy to provide good customer service. Being informed and knowledgeable of products is the key.
good,"It was okay to work there, I was always busy and there was always something to do. However, some people would get away with not doing their job, goofing off on the job or loafing around. It had a lot to do with customer service but many people lost sight of that and would be very rude or just act as if they didn't care."
good,"Nice co-workers."
good,"It's not the worst place to work, if they train you in properly. If not, you'll get in trouble for not knowing everything you need to do, then if you get overtime trying to get everything done on time, you get in trouble for that too."
good,"Safeway grocery stores are a high stress fast pace place. attention to detail, and following directions a must"
good,"prepared orders"
good,"Made many different drinks"
good,helping people with there groceries. I learned how to deal with angry customers
good,Work you like a dog in the Deli for minimum wage. Not saying all of it is bad but my experience was not good. I had a lazy manager who put all the work on us while she clipped her finger nails in the service deli!
good,The hours were not always consistent. I loved sampling food.
good,It was okay for my first job. The problem was not with the company but with me during my experience there. I was young and immature and because of that I did not do that well there
good,"I enjoyed being part of a great team at Safeway. I looked foreword to my customers coming in everyday."
good,"I learned not everyday is the same. The customers were awesome, even the picky ones."
good,I started this job right out of high school. It was a good job. This is where I learned about customer service.
good,Safeway is perfect for anyone getting into the grocery business. Co-workers are very friendly and management does an adequate job.
good,"Considerate co- workers, Direction not to clear, Management ok"
good,"Safeway is a good company.  Many great people, diversity, sometimes a bit stressful."
good,One cannot change the past ! Starting at the age of 16 and dedicating themselves to one company for 18 years. Need I say more ? I needed a change !
good,"love working here"
good,"I am a flexible member of the workforce. Depending on the shift I am working for the week I either assemble orders and am required to meet picking standards of 100%; forklifting on days I make sure product is available for the assemblers and on nights I must accurately put product away; loading trailers where I must make sure all product is accurately and safely loaded for each store on appropriate trailers then dispatch; independent shipper where I assemble orders for independent accounts and load on appropriate trailers by certain deadlines; night time receiver where I unload trailers, tag pallets of product that meet the standards for Safeway for the forklift to putaway and take care of paperwork.  There is a lot more to each of these job duties and you may contact me if you have further questions."
good,it was okay but when they hired someone who was better then me it sucked when the cut my hours.
good,The basis of the experience at Safeway was gaining great customer service skills.
good,"Decent place to work, can't say anything bad about them.  Expect to work 40 + hours, late nights and weekends"
good,"very long lines"
good,Working for this company can benefit you and can not the management of this company depending on the store plays favoritism with their employees.
good,"It was a great start off job getting my feet wet, a lot of freedom"
good,"I really enjoyed this job except for the Union Presents. The staff and management were very helpful to newbie on the floor. This is encouraging. I never felt the pressure, to be the best 100% on the products being offered. They allowed time to learn."
good,"A typical day for me at Safeway would consist of bagging groceries cleaning duties, assisting costumer with there grocery bags, & collecting shopping carts and returning them to the store."
good,"High turnover rate"
good,"a typical day working for Safeway included greeting customers, clean floors, clean bathrooms"
good,"Too little help"
good,"Great Customers, Wonderful Co-Workers! Its just very hard to work your way up in this enviorment!"
good,"Since it was busy, I stepped in to take the managing position. However, being a manager required a lot of works and responsibilities that really stressed me out."
good,Overall a good company to work for as long as you use your Union when you should. Love all the people that work there that's what makes the job most enjoyable and the customers! Being taught all the different Starbucks drinks & how to make them has also been a great learning experience!! I think the hardest part of the whole job is not having a set schedule and your hours always very but besides that it's not the worst job around!! :]
good,"was very close to home and had fun working with people I grew up with, Moved up within the company and gained a lot of experience which has helped me to this day."
good,"A big, Well structured company. The store was in a nice and safe enviroment"
good,"Responsibilities include down stacking the product from the pallets, restocking the shelves, ensuring that the shelves are neat and that the product looks attractive on the shelf, provide checkout service to customers and/or co-workers, greet and provide customer service to all customers, sort and organize back stock and communicate with the supervisor regarding back stock and inventory."
good,"Very fast paced work environment, great customer base. Fellow co-workers knowledgeable, helpful. Hardest part of the job was the commute."
good,"Very fast pace love working with people, sometimes had to work over time. I worked opening shift love having the rest of my day for myself."
good,"I worked at Safeway as a supervisor. "
good,help bag grocerys for customers. customer service and all so put backs and clean whenever needed.
good,Good place to work at and a good employer all together. This place has to be one of the great retail stores to be employed with.
good,I bagged groceries for coustomers. Cleaned when there was nothing to do.
good,"Start out working a normal cashier's day, the manager would determine when the break would happen, even though it was supposed to be in the middle of the shift (as determined by the union).  Overall, management was very condescending in the way they dealt with all of their workers.  Co-workers were very pleasant and they are what kept me at that job for as long as I was.  The scheduler would schedule me on times when I has told them I would be out of town.  So even when I was not able to make an attempt to get to work, they would schedule me for a shift during the busiest hours of the day."
good,"I usually get to work and read what tasks the manager would like me to do for the day. Then I get on the cash register and start helping whoever is my co worker with the line because we are a pretty busy gas station. After that dies down, I proceed to do the tasks that my manager requested. Then, I get back to the cash register and stay on that for pretty much the rest of the shift since I'm a closer. In my last hour I start the closing duties such as stocking the cooler, sweeping and mopping the floor. and filling out paperwork."
good,This certain store at the time was not that fun to work at. The management was bad and some of my co-workers were very rude to people that worked under them. The hardest part of the job was just coming to work to judgmental co-workers on a daily. The most enjoyable part was when I was working at the times that the not so nice co-workers were off or weren't in to work yet. They made working with them very hard and annoying but I tried to do what I could to make the best of it.
good,"I love to work, I will work extra hard to get what I deserve for my efforts. I do enjoy helping others out as much as I possibly can. I love to build a relationship with co-workers, and get to know each other. I've learned a lot of work experience, etc."
good,no recommendation for this company the service sucks to work overall
good,i couldnt go anywhere else i did and learn all i could from this company
good,"Learning about Fruits and Vegetables, how to trim and keep produce from going bad, great social interaction Experiences, very friendly work environment, stocking, organizing skills"
good,people and expericence great pay not so great and get transfered easily
good,"There is always something to do"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy with your service. My co-workers and managers are great and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is when something goes wrong in a customer's transaction and there isn't a way to fix the problem.
good,was very disappointed when Safeway closed all Dominick's stores in Illinois
good,I worked as a produce clerk.  I checked and got my job done in produce and helped in other departments like dairy.  I learned how to manage my time with school and work.  I worked forty hours a week while going to school except my last semester I worked 24 hours.  I loved working many departments and the people. The hardest part of the job was having time to do many different tasks.
good,"Working in the Safeway Bakery was very fast pace. I merchandised daily production, recorded sales and losses, ordered and maintained inventory, and provided customer service."
good,If you like alot of customer relations then this is the place for you! smile and care about your customers.
good,"Start early morning, clean up from night before,pakage buns, slice bread and wait on customers,"
good,my day would be working on the checkouts and the kiosk selling lottery.my co workers were the ones i worked with at waitrose
good,"fun work place, great people."
good,Work  life is well balanced with personal life. Good co-workers who help us to learn new technologies and very flexible work hours.
good,I almost always worked alone dealing with customers and taking orders. I got along with basically everyone that I worked with. The management enjoyed me and always asked me to come in on unscheduled days and to stay later than scheduled. The hardest part of the job was when the store got slow and there wasn't anything to do with my time. The most enjoyable part of the day was talking to the customers and seeing my regulars.
good,I worked for Safeway for 23 years and was laid off twice.  I enjoyed my job of merchandising.  Traveling to stores.
good,"A typical day is dedicated to analyzing a lot of reports, multi-tasking,  prioritizing  tasks, executing order fulfillment strategy, and managing special interdepartmental project needs. A high degree of product end-to-end lifecycle management keeps you extraordinarily busy. Communications with other groups can be a bit tedious and frequent micro management of supervisors are difficult obstacles to get around. The company's vertical integration of a great line of products and the interaction with friendly, talented co-workers makes the job bearable and enjoyable. The company offers fundamental training classes to allow you to pursue your career interests. Overall the company has a positive image and good direction with an above average rating."
good,management is not the best at helping out others at saving there jobs. they really don't care.
good,"I started with Safeway , Inc. in June 1999 as a checker and tho my training was extremely brief I had an enjoyable time until I was moved into the Liquor store... at night.  Being female it was quite a challenge to have to confront people who were sometimes intoxicated and comprimised  mentally by (it appeared) the alcohol they had consumed and were demanding more from, guess who?..me.  "
good,"I had a great experience at Safeway, but it became to micromanaged for me"
good,stock up shelves   check stock   keep the place clean  and tidy  check all delivers
good,Would love to have been hired by this company. Great coworkers and overall good environment.
good,I typical day started very early and ended early which was nice. I enjoyed working here because I made a lot of long time friends and learned a lot about myself.
good,"To maintain an average handle time of 6.18, as well as a quality score of 95% or better, on a month to month basis. In which I exceed in both(98% quality/4.25 AHT). I am also crossed trained in several lines of business, and can handle majority of the calls that comes through the call center including escalated/Sup calls. I also take Inbound/outbound calls as well as help in the deveoplment of new agents.  On a typical day I take on adverage 50-75 calls a day.  I also assist with the help line where agents can call in if they have questions on the process.  I also assist in the training classes in developing the new hires."
good,Good stable place to work. Guaranteed minimum hours. Great health benefits. But no room for growth in both wage and position field. Can never plan events months in advance because they might not give you days off. Hours and schedule are never consistent.
good,"Stocked The Produce Section"
good,"Processed and approved applications, ran machine for vons cards to send out.  Learned how vons works with there customers and gave discounts.Good and friendly co-workers, hard part of job getting all discount cards out on time. Enjoyable part of job is we all worked together and helped each other."
good,"A typical day at work begins with an early good morning greet to all employees, walking the store asking if anyone needs assistance, getting organized with department huddles, talks of the culture of safety, excellent employees that pull together for the same goal. GOAL= the best customer service and a store that flows."
good,"helping and assisting customers was good and very motivating."
good,"My job was to cut and package meats for customers. The staff was not very willing to train me properly and the management didn't seem too concerned about it. I was left on my own many times without proper training. The customers were very understanding and pleasant."
good,"I got a decent bit of hours, and the managers were awesome for the most part, but that aside it kinda sucked."
good,"This job was good experience, but personally I prefer a non-grocery retail type job."
good,"I love what I do, I love my customers. A typical day at work will consist of knowlede of  products, making sure that customers are happy with their purchases, paying close attention to detail and keeping your area clean and neat. I have learned that just because you love your job, doesn't mean you will love the people you work with. Management is hard (at least at the store I work at). I get that there are jobs to be done, but don't treat us like we are lower than you. The hardest part of this job is that management sits over your head. The most enjoyable part of this job is the customers that you have been helping. The smiles and the personal connection you have with each of them."
good,My coworkers were helpful and good at their jobs. I learned that you can't make two bosses happy.
good,some of my co workers lack professionalism due to their age but the upper management are dedicated to making the situation better for all and are quick to resolve issues the most enjoyable part of my day is taking care of the customers who are also great at showing appreciation for my hard work and dedication to the job
good,"A fast paced ever changing environment that challenges you daily.  Capable of handling both customer and employee relations, problem resolution, merchandising, marketing, ordering, sales planning, P&L analysis, supply and inventory management, scheduling to meet budget plan.  Worked closely with a group peers providing support and training on a regular basis.  Most challenging part of the position is work/life balance.  Most desirable part of the job is the ever changing environment and the face to face interaction with the customer."
good,"Safeway is fun and busy for those that like to be on their feet all day. You will instantly learning various people and how to handle the ""difficult"" customers. Management tried many times to deny pay and deny rights to employees. Mostly all of the employees worked well together as a team and found it easy to be productive and have fun with each other and customers while working. The hardest part was working with little staff in the busy parts of the day and receiving punishment from management about problems could have been prevented if a larger work force was implemented. The most enjoyable part was constantly helping others with easy problems such as finding products on the shelf and having an exciting work day with friends."
good,I work here during the summers of my high school career. It was a good summer job and fullfilled its purpose as such.
good,"I have worked for this company for 20 plus years.  It has changed over the time, but overall it is a good and solid company to work for."
good,"I helped customers with whatever they needed. Often recieved employee rewards for being a dedicated worker, excellent attendance, and an overall good employee. I enjoyed everything about the job."
good,Large corporation with many folks who have only worked there
good,"I worked at Safeway for a few years. It was ok, as jobs go, but not really a remarkable experience."
good,A typical day at work is filled with learning. I learned to operate a register and sell stuff and work a fuel station. My managers were good and worked hard. My co-workers always were helpful. The hardest part of the job was probably getting the register with the right amount of money in it. The most enjoyable part was talking to people and learning.
good,I really enjoy working at Safeway. I enjoy serving the community and helping people. I enjoy seeing the regular customers and getting to know them by name as well as enjoy meeting new customers. Safeway is a great company to work for.
good,"As my first job out of high school i was excited into joining the Safeway family. A year in, i realized that maybe i should venture into opportunities. Although it was nice working here, its safe to say that i won't miss it."
good,"Helping customers and training employees are the best and most rewarding parts of the job. My coworkers are always smiling and helping customers. They're always willing to help out other coworkers also. The management is always helpful and positive and gives constructive criticism. I've learned a lot about how to manage my time, be organized, and manage employees and the whole department altogether."
good,"start working, prep all the foods. how to deal with upset customers. friendly environment, great co-workers. not getting enough breaks."
good,"Not a big food industry person, but the workload wasn't tough and the team I worked with was enjoyable and made great rapport with the customers."
good,"Good company to work for while saving to go traveling. Good people, good benefits"
good,"Packing stock and tidying displays. "
good,"processed freightclams; maintained register,cleaning,New Stock Displays, restocking,customer service, answering phones, training new employees, visuallycreating inviting merchandise for the clients, assistingcustomers to the best of my ability, event planning, and team assessments."
good,"Good benefits. Very competitive company."
good,Lots of cleaning and preparation required. Co-workers were helpful and knowledgeable.
good,"It was by far the longest job I had. It was also one of the better places I worked, mostly because of who I worked with. Management had some issues, but it was mostly just the store manager himself, rather than the other managers."
good,"Customer Services general clerical , shipping clerk data entry lotus 123, alpha database wordperfect  sort filed orders accurately"
good,I was encouraged to make a change everyday. Implemented lean procedures and learned more about SQF.
good,Busy engaging place to work.  Enjoyed working with the public.
good,"I enjoyed it, loved the people I worked with. I just didn't enjoy being a checker."
good,"Prepared salads, sandwiches,etc for customers' requests throughout the day, plus prepared ""grab-and-go"" food items for the deli case. Stocked deli case with new items and made sure all food was handled safely so as not to cause food-borne illnesses.  Made sure all food in the deli cases was fresh and never left for customers to purchase after expiration date."
good,go in and work my whole shift. i learned how to manage my team. the co-workers are great. the hardest part of the job is the amount of work that they ask you to do with just a limited amount of hours. secure job
good,I had a great time working for Safeway. Working for this company I have learned that no matter what you have to walk with your head held high and a smile on your face.
good,"Grocery store, held job while in college. Worked primarily at night at a 24 hour location. Poor Management at specific location and lack of support from union."
good,"Long hours spent working alone"
good,"Count down tills enter daily sales into computer."
good,When I was at work sometimes it will be fast paced and other days it would not be. I learned working that everyone will not give a lending hand to help out when you need it. I saw a couple people steal from safeway and told management but they never seem to do anything. I made a lot of good friends with my co workers. The hardest part of the job was me being trying to do everything with a little bit of help. I enjoyed that everyone was down to earth and made me feel welcomed.
good,decent place to workaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
good,"Working at Safeway has helped me to become proficient in certain areas that I was not before."
good,"I have learned and practice good interpersonal communication with co-workers, acquired customer service skills and patience in dealing with all types of individuals and organization levels."
good,Its a very demanding work place and I like that type of challenge.
good,"Work bad days and never off weekends.. to tired on your days off to do anything, you have no life"
good,"A typical day at work started with morning meetings. After morning meetings, you then stood in line to get an order which you had to complete with in the time that was allotted to you.I learned that there was a trick to every trade. It was hard but after so long you find out that there are ways to successfully complete it. Management was different. It consisted of all males but they showed no mercy and actually pushed to see you keep up with the 85% male employed company. The hardest part was having to keep up with an operating ratio and proving you can do your part. My co-workers were my biggest critics but they helped whenever you needed it. I would say I enjoyed the job because it was different and that it did keep you in shape."
good,I worked there when I was in the university. It is a good place for students to find a part time job.
good,"worked as cart collector, cashier and customer service rep. during a  union strike with many upset union members outside the doors."
good,Depending on Management there is constant hiring and firing taking place. Employees seem to be expendable to any limit that Safeway deems fit. Employee compensation is very low for the amount of work required of employees.
good,I enjoyed this job but wanted to work in a different enviroment. I knew I had strong selling skills and wanted to put them to use.
good,"This was my first job again the people I work with were not nice, there was always gossip about other new employees, yes I know this happen everywhere but I was only imagining what they were saying about me because I didn't last long, It was a very difficult first job, they only gave me a couple months and they let me go."
good,I learned how to enter act with customers and provide excellent customer service
good,"really not a terrible job, they just hire terrible employees"
good,"typical day at work in the deli making salads and sandwiches, cooking chicken"
good,"Come in and stock the food items and other store items as needed, lifted 50 plus pounds, on ladders used pallet lifters, faceing (first in first out)"
good,"Everyday I work with money orders and Western Union and have to fix problems with items a customer bought and help them figure out why the product was more than they expected and deal with refunds. I rent out movies and sale tobacco and alcohol a lot and cash out lotto and scratch tickets constantly. I have to answer phone calls and direct them to the right person or solve the issue myself if possible. I learn how to run a register and ring things up and void an item if necessary as well as how to fix Western Union errors and do refunds for Western Union. I learned how to deal with customers so that they can leave the store happy and get what they came there for fixed. My co-workers are sometimes slow when I ask them to assist a customer so at times, I end up doing it so that I don't have to keep the customer waiting because I know the last thing they want is to spend more time in the store than needed to. The hardest part of my job is dealing with all of the different complaints and making every single customer happy because some of them want more than I am capable of doing but I always find a way to compromise and give them something to make them happy. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and learning new things everyday and having fun small talks with each individual."
good,Flexible job schedule. No two locations the same. Could end up in a retail store that passed hands down flying colors to a store that failed miserably all in the same day. Many retailers should model Safeway's quality standards...by far the highest I have ever seen. Loved exploring beautiful store locations and sampling great food.
good,Working at Safeway taught me a lot of patience and how to effectively work well with customers 
good,"A typical day at work was bagging items purchased by our customers and gathering carts outside, cleaning up the sales floor, rest rooms and doing price checks. This is when I first learn the real importance of customer service and how to work other job positions such as stocking shelfs. The management could have worked with there employees in a more plight way.My other co-workers could have also had better communication between each other. The hardest part of my job was getting carts in the blazing hot sun. The most enjoyable part of my job was having customers that appreciated everything I did.     "
good,As a safeway deli clerk work hard for too little pay. the management is not your friend and will not work with you
good,was very fun place to work for got to be social with coworkers and customers
good,"I transport students from there designated stops ato and from school. It is a family run business, no advancement within the company. I work with a great group of people. I love being around the kids"
good,Learned how to order product and how to stock shelves and keep section clean. Also customerservice was a big part of the job.
good,Late nights but good people to work with.  Good benefits as well.
good,"As a courtesy clerk I had to provide great customer service, bag customer items, push in carts, and clean the store. The Safeway that I worked at was in Sun City West. There was a lot of old customers that would come in the store complaining and nagging. But other then that the customers that Safeway attracted to were great. "
good,overall i would say that Safeway is a pretty nice place to work and i didn't have any problems with anyone.
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Long days for most people, I have learned a lot about customer service. Management could be better and listen to the employees. Co-Workers are great people to work with. Hardest part of my job is being the only one on cart schedule( so I have to sweep the store, help customers, do carts out in the sun, and do carry outs, and other stuff that can be overwhelming). Best part of my job, second, the crowd starts dyeing down and we can take a break."
good,"Scanning items, remempbering produce codes, offer carry out, smile and greet customers"
good,"I should have quit this job a long time ago, if you are a student who needs an easy job then Safeway is for you. As the years went by, hours got cut and there was lots of drama between coworkers. If someone were to call in sick, shifts hardly got replaced due to the cutting of hours. I am still here now unfortunately and will be quitting soon. Not the best place to work. "
good,I was bagging groceries. Retrieving carts from outside and bringing them to the front of the store. Greet customers as they entered the store. Stocked the dairy isle. As well as other areas throughout the store. Some janitorial work here and there if it was assigned to me.
good,Working as a customer service representative and a bookkeeper in Safeway is fun. I've learned a lot of things such as interacting with the customers and I am still learning as day goes by. It is really sad to say but the management is not very good for not treating all the employees the same. I love working with my co-workers. Most of them are happy person. They help whoever needs help and share new things to each other when they learn something new. The most special thing is they always smile. The hard part of the job is when I have a long line of people to help but still need to answer the phone calls and the cashiers that needs help if there's any problem. Having them to ask me for help all at the same time. I always enjoy working because I know that everyday is a new day for me to learn new things and experience. I enjoy the fact that I resolve customers issues and help them to what they need.
good,"My job was a cashier, so I interacted with the customers on a daily basis, and tried to do what I could to make their shopping experience as easy as possible. Ex. point out alternative sale items or let them know of an upcoming sale, pack their groceries the way I would want my own packed."
good,pulling orders
good,"Hardworking dedicated coworkers, challenging changes in effect, fast moving pace, plenty of training provided, currently a lot of changes within management and processes."
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy is start processing orders from the computer, fax, and drop in prescriptions from customers. I learned how to be patient with the many disabilities people have, and also how to multi task and be on the phone with a customer and have another one in front of me. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers that because of their illness they cant understand what is going on with their order. The most enjoyable part is to know that I have given my energy and heart into helping someone that really needs it extra fast and receiving a thank you smile."
good,"Work well with others, asst. in training new employees."
good,it was a good job during school because they worked around my school schedule
good,"I was a deli clerk at this job and filling customer orders was the most important part of this position. I learned how to slice meats, cheese, and prepare other deli foods using certain machines. Management was great , and was very rarely present. Dealing with elderly had to be the hardest part because it would some times be hard for them to make up their minds. The most enjoyable part of this job was all of the different people that became a regular because I treated them as if nothing else was more important than them at that moment."
good,"Excellent! Management is very engaging in bringing up new leaders, and giving them the tools to succeed at the company."
good,"College town Grocery Store, adheres to safe food handling practices and emphasizes customer service"
good,"I enjoyed the customers/patients the most...at times, the Safeway Culture of politics could be a bit much. The other managers in the store did not appreciate the fact that the Pharmacy was its own, independent workplace, centered around healthcare. The Pharmacy Staff was often treated like ""just cashiers"" and were told to suggestive sell OTC's and the like, which was a bit ridiculous piled onto our legitimate work."
good,Constant interaction with customers and the public. Learned many skills that can be taken to several other customer service jobs.
good,"Work begins at 5:00am and usually ends at 5:00pm. I'm in stores training, auditing, ensuring Dept. Mangers and delivery drivers follow procedure and policy. In addition, my responsibility includes maintaining a fleet of trucks and managing 70 plus employees. Moreover, building a relationship with store and dristrict managers is vital to the success of your operation."
good,Typical day at work very busy and great customers and a great incentive program
good,"I enjoy working at safeway, but you cant be guaranteed full time, you get hours depending on how busy the place is, and you don't get much of a choice on your hours. I need more hours and they just can't give them to me right now."
good,Safeway is a company that sets goals and gives all employees the knowledge to meet their goals and exceed them.
good,"This position is very high paced. Must have organazational skills, time management."
good,Safeway is a company determined to provided nothing but the best for its customers and employees a like.
good,Good place to work if you are just starting out and you live at home.
good,Responsible for balancing all cash drawers for the store and balancing of books.
good,"From the time you clock-in you have to be ready. Instantly start helping customers with anything they need. Serving up the different types of Chinese food, and hot case foods, making the different types of sandwiches, packing the multiple types of salads into containers, slicing all kinds of meat. Making sure the hot case stays full of food and if it doesn't then running to the freezer to fry it up really fast. Once the rush is over then starting on the daily tasks of making salads to go out on the shelves, stocking and merchandise that needs to be out, cleaning, and continuing to help customers as they come."
good,Stocking/re-stocking shelves
good,making donuts and bread was fun co workers nice helping people helping people getting flowers
good,"The typical day is busy. I've learned to do almost every position, management aren't around long enough to get used to the store operation. My co-workers are what make my day at Safeway. Hardest part of the job is getting proper help to finish the daily task and most enjoyable part of the job is being able to move around to different departments never making the day boring."
good,My days at Safeway were somewhat consistent. I learned to have better customer service skills and to always put the customers needs first no matter what. My co-workers were just that no fraternizing I would hang out with a few as friends but that was pretty much it. the hardest part was working with someone who didn't like me so they made my job a little challenging but i managed. the best part was helping people no matter their condition. Just to know that a two second walk and a short conversation and a smile and a little help putting their groceries in their car made their day is what got me threw my days at work.
good,safeway is not a co i would work for again too mch work not enough hrs
good,Felt that management did not appreciate workers.
good,"Pros: nice staff, not too busy of a pharmacy, does lots of compounding, & patients are mostly nice."
good,"I enjoyed working here as the co -workers were great and I learnedI worked well with the public. I worked in Paradise, CA as a mail carrier for 10 yrs in the 80's which required very little costumer service. ( one on one )"
good,"I loved to work at Safeway, best job i had so far. I met some of the best people i ever worked with. I learned a lot of great things, i learned how to order, deal with customers and a lot more helpful stuff. but I didn't always agree with all the paper work that would take away from the time we had to work and help customers."
good,"It was nice place to work, some of the managers were not so nice but that's anyplace you go"
good,"well i learned how to make stuff at the bakery, the management was pretty good, my co-workers were really and i had lots of fun working with them, the hardest part was when i was at the register i didn't know what to do and the most enjoyable part was when i was at the bakery it was much fun plus i learned a lot."
good,I enjoyed getting to know and care for my customers and some co-workers. Other co-workers seemed to create un-needed/wanted drama which was hard because we worked in a small area together.
good,"Best company ever , great union reps. But will call you in at the last minute and want you to be there asap on your day off."
good,the customers are nice to get along with.Management is good.
good,"a typical day at safeway as store manager is very exiting, rewarding and stressful. There is no time for proper training on all the daily new initiatives. Co workers all great and stresssd as well. The hardest part of the job is trying to deal with a district manager that have proven that he is not cut out for the job by daily demoralizing his management team. The management team though great is afraid to stand up for themselves in fear of their job loss. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers, the employees, and overcoming all the challenges."
good,great job but extremely high stress
good,"I enjoyed working with the community, and being around different people at different times of the day. And staying busy through out my shift was not difficult to do."
good,"Early work day , fast paste, enjoyed the customers. I learned a wide variety of coffee, working enviroment. I managed a Team and work schedule, people with higher positions did not manage at their best abilities. My co-workers were very pleasing to work with, for the most part. The hardest part of the job was making sure that both companies were satisfied. I enjoyed meeting new people and getting to see my regulars and making wonderful coffee."
good,"my work was ok day by day, this job didnt really know how to set their work schedule and go on about certain situation. I really did not enjoy myself at the time"
good,Safeway was a fun place to work. You had a lot of interaction with other people.the reason why I quit was because I was starting college.
good,"I enjoyed the customers and people I worked with, it was the pay that was unsatisfactory."
good,The people that I work with make it very enjoyable to go to work along with the customers that i serve.
good,"As a produce clerk I prepared food before taking it to the floor, I would close down the produce area and ensure the upkeep in that room was to standard. I developed my customer service base her aside from my natural people person type of character I was able to stretch my service skills. My co-workers were easy going always willing to help and I never had problems with anyone, everyone seemed to get along making it a fun place to work. The hardest part of the job was the steps of preparing food, only until I was able to really put what I learned to practice and develop good habits making myself more efficient and taking an opportunity and turning it into a strength. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationship between me and my customers, I enjoyed assisting all of them while I creating the best possible shopping experience for them."
good,"typical day at work is just making sure that you always provide superior customer service, accurate with checkout make sure everyone gets breaks and lunches, help any customers with problems they might have, make sure money is picked up from registers and deposited, worked with good people and management made it a nice place to work. Hardest part is you have to bee on feet all day but it's something you get used to."
good,Worked as a Night Stocker and cashier. Fellow workers were nice as well as the customers. hard to get hours and traveled alot from store to store to get hours but well worth it.
good,"• Review financial statements, sales and activity reports, and other performance data to measure productivity and goal achievement and to determine areas needing cost reduction and program improvement."
good,"Managers got promoted based on friends not value, not understanding with days needed off or sick days. Gave good hours to friends before people that been there longer."
good,Very stressful everyday. Hard work just depends where you work.
good,"Overall, good but could be better. Good pay and very flexible on my schedule."
good,working with customers and making them coffees and making sure they were happy at all times
good,this is a great company to work for they make sure to keep you busy no matter what
good,"A typical day at work depended on the type of job required for the day. I was required and encouraged to be a jack of all trades and learned to be flexible in almost every department. Management could be fair but also expected excellence and high productivity at every turn. Sales were very important and increasing them was their primary focus, sometimes above the welfare of their employees. The hardest part of the job was going with the ebb and flow of customers and managing to stay busy even when it was slow. I loved working with my coworkers and found them to be helpful, not only with customers but also with me."
good,"A typical work day: tallying daily totals of invoices from the Safeway stores,"
good,"Awesome coworkers, management very strict and corporate-like. Non consistent hours and scheduling. Hard to move up in the store."
good,Not a job you would want to jump in.
good,the 3 years I was there we went through many managers which cause the employees to not work efficiently
good,worked in safeway as a baker's helper. Duties: Packer and stocker .
good,A typical day at work consisted of highest quality of customer service. I learned I have the ability to effectively meet daily goals independently as well as a team member. Self satisfaction on a job well done is very rewarding.
good,I learned how to be extremely friendly and greet customers. how to get along with other that I was shy around at first. my coworkers are very friendly.
good,I want to preface this by saying that my particular experience here is unique to this Safeway and not necessarily representative of any other.
good,It was low pay and you had to do a lot of physical work. Sometimes you wouldn't get a lunch break.
good,"Learned that it's good to have team work and very well communication skills. Management was great and made me want to strive more, to become better in the work place. The most enjoyable part of my job was coming to work with positive people."
good,A typical day was just helping customers and preparing sandwiches or trays. Most days were smooth and just needing to stay on top of making sure food was being rotated.
good,A typical day at work would be signing in and start putting things back to where they belonged.
good,"I enjoyed being a cashier. I had alot of responsibilitys as far as tobacco & alcohol regulations, remembering produce codes, knowledge of how to use wic and how to enters coupons."
good,This was a company that had different ethnicity which is something I loved.
good,"great place to work. the managers always made you feel welcome and was a great place to learn faces and make new relationships. I usuallu worked 6-8 hours, 3-4 times a week which was enough for me while in school"
good,"Expectations have recently become unachievable, zero work life balance, long hours. Employees are terrific, the job itself is enjoyable, but the micromanagement is unbearable."
good,This company has a high turnover of employees because they don't let their current employees know how much they are appreciated.
good,"A day of work at Safeway Distribution Center included building pallets to be sent to stores, obeying safety standards, accurately and quickly finish orders for each day. I learned how to properly handle employee relations and how to prioritize. The hardest part of the job was learning how to balance accuracy and speed when order selecting. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how the distribution system works."
good,"Tough on managers, learned everything there is to know about running a good grocery store. there seems to be a disconnect between expectations from head office and the stores capabilities. some older workers can be difficult to deal with as a younger manager. Tough hours to work."
good,"I had good experience working there. I had to work in really fast past and clean after I was done my shift. I would continue work there, but there was poor management. For two years of my work, I had 3-4 new managers."
good,They dont give you enough hours to start of with you have to be there awhille to get alot of hours.
good,"safeway is a great company to work for with good benefits and affordable insurance. however, there are no set schedules, and they expect family to come second or not at all. perfect for the single, career-focused individual."
good,Always be on your toes and ready to work! There is never a dull or down moment at this store.
good,"very fun and nice people work here, lot of training regarding the job which is good."
good,"Employed as a courtesy clerk at the moment. The job is a great ""foot in the door"" opportunity, but the lack of steady hours is a financial hardship. One can excel at the given duties, but it is quite unclear whether this provides an opportunity for advancement to more fulfilling job responsibilities."
good,Other than the occassional co-worker disruption it was a good company to work for.
good,I recommend Safeway in a way because it does come with a lot of benefits but also if I dint have much experience they’ll start u at minimum wage but u can always ask for a raise so it’s worthy.
good,You are going to be alone with your work. It is your job to make sure that the pallets you are building will fit. You need to be able to complete task at a high pace
good,"I have worked at grocery stores before and rarely ever heard of high turn over in the meat departments, but that cannot be said at Safeway. While the position is unionized, the entry pay is terribly low (for the amount of work required and expected) and there is very little chance for promotion or pay raises. One person I know who has worked for the company for well over 7 years still makes just barely more than I do, and they could be considered a manager the way they run the department more than the actual department supervisor. "
good,"Ok place to work. Only worked here for a short time. The store I worked in was pretty small, with not as much opportunity. But the workplace environment was just fine."
good,Is a simple operation they tell you every thing the like you to do on the weekly bases. you can not make any different decision from what they like you to do is there way or no way.
good,"Safeway was my first job and it provided me with an opportunity to learn the importance of character building and providing good customer service. The job was very engaging, constant interactions with people for hours on end. Throughout the years of working at Safeway, I've definitely felt more comfortable about myself in terms of applying myself in social settings. I can say I stand out more than a lot of people and always strive to be the ""light of the party,"" all thanks to working at Safeway for giving me a voice."
good,"Safeway was a pretty decent place to work for those few years I was with them. I made a few friends there whom I still keep in touch with, and I was compensated fairly well during the time I was there, even got a slight bump up when the state minimum wage went up a couple years back. Though I do remember our managers shifting out a lot at the Store level: we never had the same Assistant Manager for more than a few months or so for a good while near the middle of my run there. It stayed solid near the end though."
good,Am a hard worker very prompt an responsible an also I have great customer service skills  an  highly appreciated strength skills I do not call out of work I strive financial interests
good,I like to work with people and helping to find they need. I didn’t get to grow and new experience in my company . I didn’t get good wage. I found it ver boring day to work.
good,"A typical day is not too fast & not too slow . I learned how to find things around the store with more ease . Management is alright .Over all a pretty swell workplace. the hardest part was most of my coworkers not doing there jobs, there for i did those things for them and never got the appropriate recognization. I loved helping out customers and the human interaction ingeneral and everything in the produce department was fun to me :)"
good,The job is great depending on the departments but it’s great to work for if you’re going to school or it’s a first time job. The experience is excellent to become patient and a people person.
good,"I liked the people who I worked with but after 3 years on the job, 3 separate requests for a interview for a management position I was fed up. Good staff, bad company."
good,Good position for someone who can work independently. High pressure somewhat due to differing opinions of what is required between store management and district management. Job has become much less about actually selling products then maintaining similar standards between different stores.
good,Great team to work with but lost sleep due to back-to-back shifts constantly. The union gets in the way as well. Will pester you until you join. No consistent scheduling.
good,"The best part of the job is your fellow employees. They share the good times and the hardships with you."
good,"I've worked with the company for nearly 7 years in the bakery department as a clerk. After two years, I was eventually promoted to Head Clerk in this department."
good,"Working at safeway is fun if you have great co-workers, which I was lucky to have. The work was steady and full of moments of learning and time management."
good,*The job is fine the management is what gets to you. I've worked here for quiet some time and your co workers can make work life fine but management asks for unreasonable tasks to be done and threaten with write ups/ suspension when not complete. Customers can be rude and nasty everyone should have a job in retail at some point this job is easy. Your bosses make it a pain and ive had a few manager changes in my store.
good,"My boss was always very accommodating concerning availability changes and emergency time off. However, it seemed like it took a bit of coaxing when I wanted to change departments."
good,"It was difficult, hard and tiring. I was worked at the freezer department. I worked overnights because it worked well with my schedule with me having a baby and all. I hated working because it was stressful and tiring. I was alone in my department. I had to freaken work my butt off bringing out freaken 2 to 5 pallets every night that were like sky high and stack them. This was an $8hr job and freaken sucks."
good,The guidelines I had at Safeway was stocking selves bagging selves greet customers and helping customers to there cars when needed.i also would clean wipe things down when needed
good,"multitask,change trash,returns,return carts,sweep floors,knowledge of retail,black baskets,clean environment,friendly co workers,part time,clean bathrooms"
good,This is a very stressful place to work. They expect too much out of one person. They don't hire enough people. They do offer paid vacation after a year of employment.
good,"I had never thought that I'd work for a grocery store for 29 years, but it did provide for my family, and had great benefits. I would have been happy to continue until retirement but unfortunately stores are closing continually and it is no longer a secure job. I could have transferred to a further store, but for how long?"
good,"Safeway will give you the tools you need to further your career but nothing else. Learn all you can, and then move on as soon as possible. Be sure to not burn bridges, these will be helpful to you in your next position."
good,"Firstly it was difficult trying to even schedule an interview because the hiring manager only worked from 8-12am. The hiring process was about a month. Then finding out your hours for the week was such a burden because you had to physically go in to check it, you could only schedule time off at least three weeks in advance and even then they still schedules me. My coworkers were great but my manager was very pushy to say the least."
good,"Safeway was great company, but in the last 12 years it has gone down hill. They have no respect for the Employees and they show it by not paying them."
good,"It was an ok first job, they were pretty accommodating with scheduled  and the pay was ok not e why its mandatory for me to review it as a place of work,"
good,"I like the work I do, but in my experience it can be like going to high school. In the area I worked in there was a lot of favoritism, if you did a good job but wasn't popular with the group they moved you."
good,Must be able to help multiple customers in a quick fashion. Will be short handed a lot and will need to be able to problem solve on your  own most of the time.
good,many things to do if you have a way with people try to understand the workplace and be the best you can be at the work place and understand the things
good,There is plenty of different opportunities to advance in the company. Employees are able to be cross trained to get extra hours as well. They would rather promote within the company.
good,"Safeway used to be a career. But that time has come and gone. If you don't start as a bagger in your teens, you'll never make enough to survive on your own. And even if you do, you still may not."
good,"Overall everything was generally okay, my biggest problem was mostly customers bringing their problems into the store bringing any good mood down instantly. Other than that, as soon as the words ""I want to see the manager"" came out of their mouth, it was always a ""you should fire this person because they won't let me be mean to them"" type of tone. On the other hand, you also need to watch out for shoplifters and scammers who were always on the foot at my store."
good,"Working as a bookkeeper was pretty cool, chill and laid back. I was able to work on my time as long as I am complete at a certain time. Until this new manager came in and tries running things in an unprofessional manner. She was very rude to the employees and seemed to pick on them as well, including myself. Not sure what her mission was, but I'm assuming to cause negative vibes throughout the store. Once I learned that she was being rotated out which I never quite understood, things did get better however it it totally turned me off from working there. "
good,"Typical day would be providing customer service and making sure top selling items are always available for customers. You learn excellent customer service skills, team work, and problem solving. Management is fair and works well with schedules. Clientele is very diverse. Hardest part of the job would be time management and the most enjoyable part would be checking out the customers, and interacting with them as well."
good,"good work place and very busy, high customer service  demand. Always being lift and be on your feet all day. it was a great experience and meet new people and developed a good clientele"
good,Don’t know what to say lots too do not a lot of training given must have patience with customers. Must be able to observe others to catch on to the role you are put in.
good,"Working at Safeway was my first job and its not a terrible first job. If you love fast paste work Safeway is for you. the only problem with being a courtesy clerk there was that I couldn't find the cleaning and supplies to replace paper towels, tissue and hand soap. That was really the main problem."
good,I stripped and waxed floors at night so I really didn't talk to a lot of people are we just did my job but it's a great place to work. Management very friendly.
good,"I worked at Safeway for a while and I found the job to be very fast paced and very stressful. You were always moving around and having to help customers, you had a lot of job responsibilities and it always felt like you had very little time to get them done."
good,"I mean it’s not a bad place to work at it’s just some Safeway will try u. It depends on what u sign up for but as a delie clerk u half to cook, cut, fixed food, clean an take orders."
good,"Although the supervisors try to keep up morale (pot lucks, birthday cake once a month, relaxed dress code on Fridays/weekends), I found it a stressful place to work. Call center workers are not really able to fix most problems for their customers, and in many cases are not even able to give them pertinent information. Having the responsibility of listening to customer issues and having no tools or authority to make it right is frustrating."
good,"Safeway was a quick paced store, usually resulting in my staying at my register. I kept my station orderly & clean in order to give my customers the experience they want/need. Occasionally I would restock candy, but was at the register for most of my shifts."
good,"bad management, very hard to get a request day off or time off."
good,"Job was average, just like any other corporation.  It was fine,  strictly speaking not much creativity involved.  All product was formatted unless I was lucky enough to get a customer who wanted something special.  Loved the challenge."
good,"Management gets switched around a lot. Same with employees, high turnover rate. But coworkers that stick around you'll laugh together about irate customers. If you're not getting enough hours in one department you can cross train in another."
good,"As the title says, Safeway is an alright place to work. Nothing special. Expect to get let go in a New York minute, should you not be able to make it in to work due to the roads being closed though."
good,"a lot of pressure and under staffed due to economy, people and co worker's are friendly.good times bad time at safeway. mostly bad times. a lot of absent ties and people getting hurt and and being intimated to stand up for them selves me included,"
good,"Working at Safeway was good for gaining experience in the retail field of work. However only working part time at minimum wage was just not going to cut it. I have no complaints about my job nor the people I worked with, they were all very kind and helpful during my time there. I simply need a job that pays more and gives me full time."
good,I enjoyed talking to the customers but my manager was very unhappy with my fellow coworkers helping the customers in the store because she felt that it was slowing us down from completing our work. What a joke!
good,"I work at night, the nights are usually slow paced, and very calm. I learned many different ways to deal with customers, and how to treat them respectively. What I also learned is how to deal with money in a faster pace. The workplace is just like any other grocery store except you have your own personal space. Which makes it a comfortable environment to work at too. Hardest part of the job is the fast pace with the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when things get really calm, and empty."
good,Its a good place to work if you are going to school because the hours are flexible. Besides that there are not a lot of benefits to the job. Yes you get insurance and time off for part time but you are union so you have to pay union dues for a job you are only making minimum wage and working only 20-30 hours a week. Depending on you situation it could be a good job but for the most part it is not a great place to work.
good,"This job is good if you work well customers. You will encounter different people in the store, either outgoing people or just people who aren't having a good day. This was my first job so I did not expect who I would run into and what I would do at work. There are also ""shops"" where there are undercover managers or bosses who test to see if you are doing well in your store so you must keep a customer-oriented bearing at all times."
good,"As a checker at Safeway, most of the day would, of course, be spent checking, working with customers, etc, exactly what you'd expect.  However, the longer I stayed, the more noticeable the cracks and flaws in the system of management were.  Management barely ever communicated with the rest of the staff unless it was a matter of severity/punishment for poor quality, there was no system where we were able to speak to them about actual needs we had."
good,"Was greeted by fellow co-workers and then was instructed on which daily tasks needed to be completed throughout the day. Before preparing produce, I made sure that everything around me was cleaned and organized to avoid any safety risks for co-workers and customers of the store. After making sure the area(s) were safe, I took the proper steps in order to prepare produce foods (e.g. parfaits, cut-fruit) to display them in the produce sections for purchase. Also, outside of preparing produce, I was able to help customers with any questions and needs, and made sure that the produce section was organized for a neat display to costumers. The hardest part about the job was clean-up at the end of the day, especially when we were under-staffed. Overall, my experience with Safeway allowed me to really work on my personable skills, as well as skills that revolved around time-management, and problem solving."
good,Everything pretty fair and the work environment it excellent with Teamwork. A typical day at work would usually go by slow but a lot could be done in the amount of time. The Mangers are great love to work with you as one.
good,"You work 12 hour shifts ,sometimes on  your own and with very little support from technicians. They have very tight labor budgets  and it is hard to keep up with the work load."
good,"I was frequently schedules 2-8 hrs a WEEK. Management was not willing to provide more hours. Other than that, people were nice enough and it's pretty laid back. A lot of cleaning."
good,"It was my first job, that allowed me to work through high school as well as through some college. they were very flexible with my hours, and gave me the opportunity to move to different positions around the store."
good,It was hard to make decisions when you are bound by a corporation located in another state to give input on an area they didn't know much about. You were left waiting for answers on decisions that should be a quick turn around time on.
good,I felt unsafe at Safeway since there's no security due to employees being suggested to not engage or try to stop people stealing from the store. Also management didn't know how to take care of the deli.
good,"Safeway is a decant place to work, and is a good place to get experiance. Managment has a good understanding of work life balance. Hours kind of suck, but good for students."
good,"Would rather not review, employment was years ago and the quality of the workplace may not be the same as it was during the time that I was employed by the Safeway company."
good,Working at Safeway is a great place to work depending on what department you work in most of the Departments are great the hours are usually about 8 hours a day so you're not too stressful working in the bakery though is a little more stressful than anything but you just have to deal with customers and stuff like that so so if you want to work there it's a great place get lunch breaks you get breaks it's a great company to work for
good,"I started working for Safeway at 1988. I left and came back because of the benefits.  I love the people I work with . My Manager Is wonderful .The grocery industry is a hard labor and hard hours for a family .NO set hours No set days . Even if you have to request days off your risking your job. after all the years I have been working for them , I still do not have set days off .  I can close tonight and be on the schedule for opening and I will not see my family for days."
good,"Merger with Albertsons' turned a profitable company to a loss company.  A big part of this downturn was venture capital debt, but there are also operational issues."
good,"When starting the management rewarded good work, but as time went on the corporate management push for standards that didn't always benefit the stores."
good,"I would start the day at a nearby Safeway store, clock in, and access a computer to look at my current repair order tickets.  I learned a lot about retail environment and the IT equipment used.  The culture was a busy workplace environment, but respectful.  The hardest part of the job was prioritizing repair tickets with the distance between Safeway stores.  Management is always busy but responsive to my inquiries."
good,my typical day at work is very calm . I learned how to lead customers around the store. The management was not that great but since we have anew one its starting to pick up good services. The workplace is a safe environment to work in . The hardest part of the job is knowing most of the answers to the  customer question.  The most fun part about the job is to see everyone smiling and working together  as one whole family.
good,Only recommend courtesy position for teenagers in or just out of high school. Possibly a college job. Under paid and no fixed schedules so can be highly unreliable.
good,"Safeway is a great place to work if you are a people person. I learned that being apart of a successful team, work environment means having a diverse group of personalities. The typical workdays are 4 to 8 hour shifts, but you are always on the go and the environment is fast paced most of the time. Time management and staying on task is key to being successful at this job, regardless of position or title. "
good,"Fast paced and always dealing with customers. Like all groceries, they limit your hours to avoid overtime. Schedule changes every week making it hard to budget. Rarely does anyone get rewarded or promoted."
good,"It's important to get along with others at this company, not just coworkers, but customers. At Safeways, customer service is most important, so sometimes you have to be ok with just accepting things."
good,Safeway was a great company to work for it was a good learning experience. I appreciated the opportunity they I had while working with the company and the skills I learned there.
good,"I got to work about 30 minutes early, went up to my locker and put on my apron and settled down until it was time to clock on. Punched on and looked at the sweep and temp logs to make sure they were up to time. Bagged at a check stand and bagged groceries for awhile, checked how many carts there were and went outside when it was less than half full and brought in carts. The checkers are friendly and will help customers find items when I didn't know where they were."
good,Worked here for about 19 months before i had to quit to focus on my final year of high school. Great atmosphere to learn and to develop new skills as well as to meet new people.
good,It's a great place for people who like to work hard and have no social life. The benefits and pay are great. If you dont plan on staying get out before you are vested
good,It was a nice place with really fun and genial people. The work itself was not very amusing. One of the errands you had was to pick the trash and I definitely was not a fan.
good,"My time there was good, until i noticed favortism. They treat you different if you call out, and write you up for a lot of things. The manager was unfair to alot of workers."
good,"The first 5 years I was with Safeway it was the most amazing place to work and at that time I would have scored it all 5s. Once the old CEO retired and the new one came in, it became all about the bottom line and the care about the employees went out the window."
good,"Worked here part-time. It's really hard to get full time hours when you start as a part-time employee. I did not work the best hours. Most of hours were late evening, holidays and weekends, which isn't idela for job work/life balance."
good,The job is actually a cool job its just the employment they had working there. I just feel like i can take my hard work and talent to another company that appreciates my work.
good,I wish the company would provide more hours because getting 24 hours is not enough to survive out here and when supposely we do increase in sales they end of giving more hours to other departments rather then the department that has earn them the sales when most of the time each employee is working by themselves.
good,"Management need big improvement with appreciation of employees, they play favourites and there is a special group where you either belong or not. Change of management would be great."
good,"A day of work at Safeway (Deli)  is very stressful. It has only 1 personnel to do all the tasks like customer service, cashiering, taking orders, sometimes making sandwiches (because the one whose in-charge is on lunch break)  cutting of meats. It's like multi-tasking. On the positive note, I learned a lot. Management is just fair.  The workplace is good and work force is multi-culture. My hardest part of the job is the cutting of meat for customers.  My most enjoyable part is taking orders from customers and cashiering."
good,Some days at work can be hectic and one needs a lot of patience. I like the flexibility of the work which gave me the opportunity to further my studies.
good,Fellow employees were wonderful to work with but there was a bit of favoritism within the store and with district management. Also bakery district manager assistant was never truly helpful to the store I worked in...always focused on the other stores in the district
good,It was a great time at safeway but sometimes they weren't as reasonable with the hours you wanted and were on cal most of the time which sucked. also not great of a pay.
good,"I like working at safeway for the customer service aspect of the job. I liked helping elderly folk put groceries in their car, I liked helping people find the food they are looking for, I liked joking around with the customers as well because they were almost always amicable."
good,"The management is uncannily lax."
good,The Store Manager not recommended she have favorites which is not even good on performing duties  and not enough knowledge on products and services. No training either for new clerks just start your first day and figure out yourself what to do.
good,"Checking and bagging groceries. Stocked and rotated produce.  Built end displays."
good,"I enjoyed working at the bakery but the main reason I left was because I was told I could work the third shift consecutively and that didn't happen, so over time with the sporadic differences of my shifts my sleeping schedule became really messed up and I felt like it was affecting my day to day functions."
good,It isnt for me but I’d work for them again if I needed too.  The Hours Changed Weekely and they’re positions were over filled so there was always confusion between workers and management.
good,Next to all the customers demands and managers telling you what to do. This is a good high school/part time job if you just want to get some easy and fast money.
good,"I learned a lot working at Safeway. I met a lot of people, and I enjoyed the majority of it. I don't think I would go back. There were times when I had trouble with the hours, and there were many times when our breaks were not given to us when they should have been."
good,Ever since the merger there has been a tremendous amount of work to do with very little support from senior leadership and backstage support. This is mostly due to extreme cost control measures and the elimination of many support positions which made the retailers job easier.
good,Not good they dont care about anything that goes on in your life outside of work. They for the most part dont care about how hard you have to work and how much you have to give up to get a hob done
good,"My manager and the people in my department were awesome. We were like a family. but I can say that I felt overworked. at the end of the day like most places I was the only one left. So I had my tasks to do and help customers.Which was all fine and dandy, but it was exhausting and often I would have to work overtime (which wasn't recognized until the last day). But I loved those who I worked with, mostly."
good,"Stable job with set paychecks, well-run management, usually well-collaborative people, Union job, job requirements are clear and reasonable. Only set-back was how proffesional the work environment was, too much lack of completing job to the fullest."
good,"Fast paced, lots of customers coming through the checkstands. Bagging groceries. Physical and mentally demanding job. Dealing with conflict resolutions. Diverse cultured co-workers. Management communication needs lots of work on work ethics. The hard part of this job is the physical part and mental part. Be prepared, it can be stressful on a daily basis. The enjoyable part is you get to meet all kinds of people from different walks of life. From your co-workers to your customers.  The part you enjoy is your nice friendly customers that you established yourself with.  They keep coming back to you and making their day awesome."
good,"In general, Safeway is a poorly managed store. Since the Sobeys takeover, the atmosphere is dull and gloomy. There is no effort being made to help employees feel good about all the changes. There is little effort in general in staff performance. This store is riddled with bullies, behind the scenes schemes and favoritism."
good,"simple repetitive tasks "
good,"Great place to work.    "
good,I was wrongfully terminated I have nothing to say. people make up lies an rumors in this company & then you end up getting fired because of it an the so called union your paying to protect you really doesn't do much for you in the end. I have been a loyal employee for almost 12 years. Iv been done wrong by Safeway an the employees at the  rehoboth beach de Safeway location.
good,"some jobs had a lot of requirements and duties to fulfill and sometimes not enough time to finish them so i felt rushed but still got the job done had to clean the store by sweeping with a push broom through all departments, wipe down check stands, take out all trash from all garbage cans in the store, clean the bathrooms and maintain toiletry items soap, towels, toilet paper, ect. fetch carts from outside line up in the designated cart area for customers, and put back all unwanted items in their designated spot in the store."
good,Safeway is a great place to start a career and learn about the retail on the groceries side. Learn about stocking and shelf standards. A little bit of merchandising involved. Inventory control and cash handling.
good,"good people, learn many new things from selecting to sanitation to forklift etc...the job wise is ok not too hard not to easy its bearable.."
good,"Working in the freezer sucked because it was -20 degrees F so my nose would freeze and the freezer is 9/10 times a mess."
good,"Great place to work if you're looking for excellent work life balance.  If you are looking for quick advancement, this may not be the place as often times store employees have preferential treatment vs. outside recruits."
good,"A day at Safeway is often busy"
good,Great atmosphere very up beat crowd competitive co-workers always some thing to do . Always room to grow and advance within the company. Good benefits
good,Super chill and you'll get comfortable fairly quickly. The job was pretty mediocre and was very systematic. Coworkers made the job enjoyable. Management was okay.
good,"Starbucks department was incredibly fast paced, lots of multitasking. Management was great. Some opportunity for growth and advancement. Great place to start professional work experience."
good,"most co workers are awesome, the job itself can be fun and can be very challenging, that being said, sometimes the management doesnt give you the tools u need to succeed in your tasks."
good,"steady work, great boss, great co-workers. Ienjoyed the people and the locals loved to see regular employees.I really enjoyed the seniors that visted the store on Tuesdays."
good,"Excellent training and educational processes, but my location had too many managers and not enough staff, Which puts stress on employees when demands are made from multiple sources, each wanting their job done first.  Tried discussing these concerns with management but was ignored then later let go, placing blame on me rather than the disorganization.  With that said the company as a whole is good to work for, would have loved to have transferred to another department that was more organized."
good,I like how fast paced my job was. The customers that came in were usually very kind and nice to talk to. The only downfall was that the store I was working at only scheduled me only 4 hours a less a week.
good,"The work environment was fast pace and a fast learning system, the management wasn't very good at helping the team but when they did the work place was steady."
good,I floated to several Safeway Pharmacies around Oregon. I liked working different locations and meeting new people all the time. Sometimes it was a really great day and sometimes you just want to do your job and get out of there.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the physical work provided at Safeway, however, the delivery model does have several issues. This structure has created an impossible setting for advancement, as drivers that have been with the company the longest make more than most new employees will ever have the chance to make. A $0.40 raise after a year of work is not nearly worth the time, or the effort provided to advance. Veteran drivers will keep lower level employees from advancing by forming an alliance and falsely/misguidedly reporting to higher authority. On top of this, there are no immediate supervisors which is both a blessing and a curse. You can be doing an impeccable job with this company and no one will be there to notice for the entirety of your employment. Unfortunately, the best way to get ahead in the company is to initially be horrible at the job and then get better over time, rather than being impeccable and impressive during the entirety of your employment. I found this to be my main reason for leaving, as I was unsatisfied with the way I was treated as an employee after having worked diligently and tirelessly through a 120 degree Summer season, and then some, all while attending school full time. It was never enough for Safeway, and my work was never recognized financially or otherwise. They seemingly paint a beautiful picture for new employees as to make them work diligently for benefits/higher pay/advancement. What they don't tell you is that your job/pay advancement is not dependent on your quality of work. On a positive note, if you are looking for a short term job, this is"
good,• Assist cashiers and customers at the checkout counter by bagging purchased products
good,"It’s a good job you can stay there don’t get stuck in the deli cause they will try to"
good,"Good job to have , good benifits when you get them. "
good,"It is a good job, not a career though.Pay is terrible. You can work at the crack dawn one day, then super late the next day. They can schedule you any time they want."
good,Always a fun experience working with happy people and Safeway seems to attract very enthusiastic employees to their roster and made it a fun time working there.
good,"I started out taking cash the went to stock non food items which I really liked to do. There were to many managers and not enough workers. It was herd to get all your loads stocked because you were always covering the front registers. I enjoyed the people I worked with, I seem to get along with everyone."
good,"A typical work day for me was punching in and starting to get carts and start to clean or bag for customers. From what I learned while working at Safeway is always stay focused and on task. The management at the downtown Bellevue store was very demanding but still good. "
good,"I found that working with the company is good, everyone is friendly towards one another.  The downside  to the job is that the starting wage isn't what i thought it would be."
good,"-bagging, cleaning, and helping people out to there cars ect."
good,The employees are nice but sometimes customers tend to be rude and you won’t be able to have a secure paycheque. I like how there’s union but sometimes it could suck because they don’t protect us from unexpected cutting hours.
good,"This was my very first job, and the experience gave me a good idea of what to expect in retail. I dealt efficiently with many problems that rose up in the work environment."
good,"Along with continuous complaints from entitled customers, the non-union position made it difficult to feel appreciated and satisfied in this work setting.   The co-workers were easy to get along with and I made lifelong friends while I was there."
good,I loved working here until they took advantage of my skill set. the managers were awesome but the store was a low volume which meant that labor had to be low and sometimes we would get busy and be understaffed
good,"I had a good time working at safeway, especially for my first job because its a little more laid back than the average job. Not a whole lot to stress about which was a good thing."
good,Well i give it a bad review because the Safeway i was worked at was in Berkeley and they were so unorganized they didn't treat it like it was a place of business. I was a courtesy clerk and they made us do everything also treated us like we were janitors and off tops the front mangers were all rude.
good,Personally I had not too many issues with this employer because I mostly ran my own department and excelled at my position. The management could use a look into though as I'm sure better qualified people are waiting in the wings for a deserved opportunity.
good,"nine times out of ten you are busy the whole time you are working and that is a plus but yet the only thing I complain about is NO hours and inconsistency of work time such as I will work 12am to 9am then same day come back 10 hours later its hard sometimes, and the hours are constantly different so its hard to make appointments ect."
good,A private equity firm has acquired Safeway; as result the company culture has changed significantly. The equity firms’ only interest seems to be concerned with squeezing every last dollar out of Safeway.
good,"stocking produce, customer service, working various shifts, sampling produce, working with the team and solving problems with in the department. learning order writing for produce."
good,"I don't know what anyone expects working a grocery store, but you should expect to be under appreciated by at least one of your bosses, and not enough hours. The coworkers there are 50% people who take that job way to seriously and 50% fun people to bs with in free time. Not terrible, but not something to make a career out of. Also there is a Union. I personally disliked them."
good,"Nothing to terrible to complain about, minimal room for advancement but decent wages considering the workplace. Laid back environment suited towards students"
good,"Friendly work environment but there is a lack of capable management and the workers have to pick up the managements slack. Safe and clean work space, and there is room for advancement."
good,"It provided great benefits a medical care , however poor job training skills by management us mainly why I was not there for too long of time and it was a poor work environment for those who can not do things fast paced . Although some people were very nice , I was called stupid and had an anxiety attack because of it , I learned not to stay at a job if I dislike it."
good,"Management unreliable and rude, schedule done only 3 days in advance, no help, degrading of employees, some teachable moments, no seniority given and cheap (buy your own uniform)."
good,Pay is great if you work here long enough. Never enough help and too many things are allowed to happen with no repercussions.  Fellow employees are friendly.
good,"I was hired on as a Deli Clerk to which I would start work at 4:30 in the morning 5 days a week. I was taught how to do everything there, however, they throw you into it after only about 3 days of training and expect you to know everything. Management was pretty good, they made work more fun. Though the hardest part was just all the running around and the stress to get through all the customers as quick as possible so that you can attempt to finish your daily tasks."
good,Everyone have the same mind frame which is getting the job done before the end of the day. Everyone thought of safety while driving the pallet jacks on the floor.
good,"I don't know that telling you working in retail is difficult is even worth my time, but that is all I really have to say about my time a Safeway in Everett."
good,"Most customers were fairly nice, with the exception of a few. Long hours and worked more than my intended availability because of other coworkers quitting or getting fired. Managers didn't seem to know much."
good,"It's a good place to get your foot in the door to the workforce. They're very lineant on new-hires and there's always work, stable pay and opportunities for advancement are prominent. "
good,It is nice to work in Safeway. but overall the management is not so good. Over hiring cause fewer hours to employees. Enjoyable thing is that everyone is friendly.
good,"Safeway is a fast paced environment, the employees are always friendly. Safeway offers competetive pay and great benefitsavailable  to those whome are in need."
good,Every day I left my job feeling like I was not finished. It seemed the more we did the more the company cut help. That made it very hard for proper customer service. I would not work there again.
good,This job was over night I had no life out side of work I wa slicky to have some good work friends but if not for them I would have been out of there the first few months
good,"Typical day at work was hectic at times ,especially weekends and  between 4-6 p.m."
good,"Easy, fast paced job where I learned about the produce department.  Nice management, advancement opportunities.  Unfortunately the pay is low and even if you get a promotion to assistant manager you are not compensated very much.  No benefits unless you're full time and they don't offer much full time."
good,"working in grocery business, you were faced with changing product knowledge, product education and catered to your customers needs and wants and pitfalls"
good,"I enjoyed some of the people I worked with, but it was mainly run off seniority (who was hired first) and that was mainly how they ran. It was hard to get days off and they did not really accommodate for sports or other events and left you trying to find someone to take your shift."
good,"It's a retail job, so nothing out of the ordinary. As long as you like your coworkers it's not a bad place to be. It definitely kept me busy, which was awesome."
good,"The managers there hated their life, and everyone working there knew it and felt the same way. The only difference between this and any work place was the open disgust for the company that everyone shared."
good,"The Vons I work at is a great work environment with friendly co-workers. However, it's been two years and I still am just a courtesy clerk even though I've been asking to move up to a higher position."
good,Work could be hectic. Had to work alone in a department. Manager was nice but was always on different shift. Other employees were fun made job bearable. Setting up seafood department was the hardest part. Making customers happy was enjoyable.
good,you'll often never be bored working as you'll always have customers from the start to the end of your shift. Since the price reductions there's been an influx of customers.
good,"I would go to work, push carts, throw away trash bags, clean bathrooms, and help customers needs, for example bagging their groceries and helping them with there needs to find certain products."
good,Originally was a good company to work for. They have good benefits. Once ownership changed hours were cut and full time was not an option.
good,Safeway has been very good to me however the work/life balance is a continuing challenge.  Excellent advancement opportunity for the dedicated employee.
good,"Safeway is a good company to work for, they provide great benefits. I started out as a courtesy and two years later i was able to move up to a produce clerk. Here I learned about bagging groceries and helped customers out to their car, as well as bring carts in and clean. When I moved to produce I learned what quality produce was and pulled expired items to the back. I communicated with customers and helped them find what they were looking for whether in the produce area or another part of the store. The management was good when I first started but when Albertsons bought out Safeway and things changed dramatically, the stress got pretty high and the tension between management and employees. The hardest part was trying to make sure I was keeping up with the new changes in the end."
good,"The management at the safeway I work at is kind of awful. The one assistant manager is not very friendly and will nit pick at you if she ever has to talk to you about one issue. The job itself isn't bad, but if you get a shift time that doesn't really work for you and you talk them, they don't really care and will keep putting you on that shift  constantly anyways. Rotation of job shifts are not very good. I like helping the costumers, which is the best part of the job. The workers are all great except for a few. Learning the job, not many really want to help you, unless they're the same job title as yourself."
good,"At this job I worked as a courtesy clerk helping customers, mopping sweeping and clean up spills. Gather carts from parking lot. Employees were great."
good,"Safeway was a decent place to work, decent pay, decent management, and decent hours. Great for if you're a student and need something with shifts that go till 11pm."
good,"I worked Treasurer, serving customers, and follow-up customers to tell them where the offers, and help them to get to what they are asking. And transfer their wares to the car."
good,"Safeway will keep you on your toes everyday is a new challenge."
good,"I realty don't know about Safeway, other than I shop there all the time. I like their $5.00 Fridays. And I get all my perscriptions"
good,"On a typical day I work I would have to make sure that the store stayed clean. There would be occasional spills and drops of food products so that would require a clean-up. I would also have to help customers from time to time point them in the direction of the item they desired. While also bagging items for customers and making sure to always make the customer happy. My coworkers came from many different backgrounds. I am a very friendly and helpful person so I believe that I mesh well with people of different situations.The hardest part of the job would have to be managing to do all of those tasks including taking out the trash, grabbing shopping carts and making sure that everyone is satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job would be helping customers and making them happy. By taking on this job I learned patience and that you are never going to make everyone happy so you have to practice not reacting to situations such as those."
good,"I worked at Safeway for 11 years in 2 different locations starting out as a bagger but majority of the time I was a cashier and I always liked the people I worked with.However, the job was very taxing on your time and energy. I mostly worked the midnight shift. Which had pluses and minuses.   only thing management seems to care about is asking for customer surveys."
good,I enjoy Working for Safeway the environment is wonderful my co-workers are great and the managers are wonderful leaders they encourage us to do better and they show us how its done would not go anywhere else
good,"Safeway is fine for a summer job, or a short term part time job, but advancement is highly limited.  If you have anything higher than a high school degree, there are better jobs out there"
good,I loved my job at Safeway. What I did not like is the fact that I had a very unprofessional department manager who made working at this particular location very difficult. The job itself was very enjoyable.
good,Stocking shelves and off loading merchandise through out the store. Maintenaned the isles to ensure an accident free environment . Made sure we faced the items on the shelves to provide a clear view of products brand.
good,"Working at Safeway taught me valuable skills. A day at work was bagging, fetching carts, helping people find things scattered through the store, helping customers to their car, and just being a friendly involved person. Overall the job was pretty simple."
good,"I could not support myself at this job what so ever. The people were awesome but being borderline poverty isn't. If you still live at home, this is a great place. If not, look elsewhere."
good,"The working experience here was alright. My co-workers were decent, so was my department manager. Store management got better once they started buckling down on things that mattered."
good,fast pace company with numerous job opportunities that can be applicable to various types of individuals who are seeking employment
good,"Safeway is an amazing way for high school students or ex-cons get off the ground. Store 1511 is an amazing place to work, everyone is friendly and it's amazing talking to some of the customers that shop here. Management is more on the relaxed side, and they are exceptional at exceeding standards. The hardest part is that you need to be able to multi-task quickly while dealing with customers. They really work with your schedule, but I don't find much use of benefits since everyone is technically part-time here."
good,"The best part of the job was my co workers, they were all friendly and outgoing. Worst part was working so late, it closes at 12 so we were usually there until 1230."
good,"Fast paced environments that requires delegation to peers, work flow to maximize efficiency, and a ability to be flexible with each day.  Often while performing tasks, we are asked to shift gears and redirect focus."
good,"While working at this company I have been given the opportunity to greet customers and help them locate products, while providing great customer service."
good,"The work environment was very nice, great people and great customers. The job was physically demanding and constant moving around. There is never a moment to stop and rest until break or lunch time."
good,"Its a good company but with recent ownership there are things they need to smooth over. "
good,"Clock in, get carts, sweep floors, bag merchandise for customers, and did a lot of side jobs that required janitorial work."
good,"A typical day would include, clocking in, walking the back room to see where my load is located on my way up to my station, checking orders and times due, checking notes left by other employees regarding customer inquiries or orders, make phone calls back to customers if necessary, take care of any immediate orders, straighten up all displays and rotate new stock out to fill sales floor, break down my pallet/pallets and bring up to my area, process and store in cooler, take care of all phone calls, customer service, check e-mail, invoices, sales, update books,design arrangements, help customers make orders for special occasions, help customers locate items,make sure everything is cleaned up, and stocked before leaving."
good,"Clocking in exactly on the dot, the first place you check into is the Self-Checkout where you sign your daily employee sign offs for any new regulations, produce tests, or just the regular basket check sign off. Once in, you bag a few times for the checker you're about to take the place of then hop right in. The pace goes fast as the summer sales fly in and before you know it hours have flown by and you're standing behind the register with no customers as the night slows the flow to a near stop (with occasional clusters of shoppers). You begin to tidy up the work place, clean your check stands, and check out the candy area for any misplaced items."
good,"This job often requires unrealistic expectations, has high turnover rates, and understaffed to the point where calling in sick is almost frowned upon and impossible."
good,"Safeway has been a really good first job for me to be 16. Co workers are really friendly as well as the customers, the store is ALWAYS clean with no complaints and the benefits from the union are cool !"
good,after 29 years safeway lost their  care factor for their emplyees . the management lost touch with the emplyees and   the bottom line was the only important thing . in reality the single most valuable asset to a company is their employees and the  companies should treat them like they are an asset not an expendature.
good,Typical work days tended to be hard do to either a lack of employees or  unexpected issues that would arise and slight changes in work schedule. The store I worked at had problems with getting hours for the positions that needed and it also had trouble finding reliable workers for some positions.
good,"clean the store"
good,"work was decent, a lot of issues with employees and supervisors half fast work and leaving it all for others to do, good customer service, and a clean work envorionemnt"
good,most of the staff were nice and understanding but when it came to bringing ur personal life into the work place most people did so
good,"My typical day is spent bagging, pushing carts, cleaning and doing things as they come up."
good,"Wasn't too happy about the fact that you will get call almost all days to cover shift for others."
good,It's an okay place to work at just there is a lack of communication between staff members. Co-workers are good and we worked together to get the job done.
good,"Safeway tells you promises during the hiring process. overall, hours are minimum and pay raise is very low. my experience with the manager was great but corporate never recognized the employees when they came in, unless they absolutely had to. if you're working different departments, there's some advantages but overall, if they don't need you, they will put you back where u were and advancing in the business is just a dream. I do think its a good work place for teens who are starting off with their first job."
good,"Enjoy working for the company but need to find a position with more stability, the management seemed to not always be on the same page as the employees."
good,"My personal experience with Safeway has been fine, no major hiccups, but I work in the Starbucks kiosk as an Assistant Manager or Team Lead, so my experience with Safeway is a bit different than say a checkers or a courtesy clerks. "
good,You find yourself putting your patience to the test on an average basis. It is okay though if you can handle it. I learned that it was no hassle working there. The Management is kind and understanding but demanding in a good way.
good,"I do not like most of my co-workers, there is only few that I like. Most of my co-workers are bad at what they do (work). The hardest part of the job is working with people who do not want to work."
good,"The company is going through large corporate changes in its backstage operations since the merging of Safeway, Inc with the Albertson's Company. Their are opportunities if willing to relocate."
good,Organised and methodical routines made this job enjoyable.  Often difficult and given less and less time on my own department but still enjoyable
good,Great job security and friendly workers. My favorite park of the job is helping the customers find what they need and seeing them leave very satisfied. I've learned a lot that will apply to future jobs and usable information for outside of the workplace.
good,The coworkers at this job treat me like I do not know anything. The pharmacy manager is amazing. I learned more from this job than my previous one. A typical day at work for me is any day for a pharmacy technician.
good,they have very friendly people but if you don't have a good manager its hard to work there because they are never happy with what you do. if you are really sick and you called in on time they would get mad at you and even cut your hours.
good,"My typical work day revolves around receiving meat and cutting to specifications of the company and whatever the customer wishes. Meat Market manager is amazing and a pleasure to work with. The corporate structure is less than desirable at best, upper management are constantly cycled out since the merger with Albertsons. They flood the markets with product people don't want to buy."
good,You work 81/2 hours a day. There is very minimal opportunity for advancement as there is a union. New employees do not have much chance of advancing into higher roles because senior employees get first call. Management is very strict especially with new employees.
good,Working here at Safeway was my first job and it taught me a lot about the customer service business. I did struggle the first week but soon adapted very quickly.
good,"Overall it's an okay place to work. I'd recommend to someone who is going to school because they can work with your schedule if you're a part- time employee. As far as a career, it doesn't pay enough. Pay tops out around $21 an hour. Unless you go into a management role. Managers are always stressed out. Lots of hard, physical work, cleaning up after people, including fellow employees (which get annoying) You'll be getting down and dirty... literally."
good,"Lots to do all the time, with more coming. The good thing is if you have great customer service skills, you can juggle the charm to your advantage and make the wait time not so unbearable for your customers."
good,Early starts and straight to work which is what i like .you find your department for your shift and maintain that department keeping the area clean and stocked with food rotating stock throughout the day.
good,"Hard working , fast pace, never a dull moment- organizing your time and skills to produce maximum product - Great customers and employees."
good,"I had the pleasure of working along side some of the best coworkers and senior management individuals in the manufacturing, distribution and retail grocery business.  Personal advancements were consistent and the retirement programs were exceptional."
good,Very busy and fast paced job. Supervisors were great to work with. Pretty flexible schedule. I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle tough situations.
good,"Overall, I enjoy my job. It provides a balance of labor, socializing(customer service) allows for creativity and provides me the opportunity to contribute to the success of a corporation, which gives me the feeling of success. However, I have reached my capacity, with regards to salary and look forward to finding a new career that incorporates all these aspects and provides an increase in compensation."
good,"It was a good place for me as a young adult to get by, i was underpaid and over worked but it paid the bills. Over all i think safeway did its part as an employer."
good,"I enjoyed the people I work with, but management really made the experience unpleasant. I felt undervalued at times and discriminated. They would cut my hours and that is basically why I left the store. I needed more hours."
good,At Safeway you job is certainly secure but It will take years to advance to a management position. Your coworkers are great for the most part and the customers are spectacular.
good,"A typical day working for Safeway has goods, but the majority there is lot of stress and crazy hours. The hardest part of the job was going to school as a full-time student and receiving an 8 hour work load."
good,"My typical day at work at safeway was pretty fast going, mostly because there would be a lot of customers needing help. I would bag people's groceries and get carts from outside. Every two hours i would sweep the whole store. There wasnt really a hard part of my job, it was pretty laid-back. My most enjoyable part of the job was bagging and talking to customers. My co-workers were very friendly and welcoming."
good,"Vons was a great place for a first job. Learned all about customer service as they do provide some of the best customer service out there. Pay isn't great, but for someone just starting out, it works."
good,"I liked working at Safeway especially while I was on stock management as I was a supervisor in charge of a small team on weekends and some evenings. During the day the morning shift would reduce the price of refrigerated products (produce, dairy meat) and bread by about a third. These would be rotated to the front of the shelves so they're seen by customers first and sold first. I or one of the other part timers would come in later and then further reduce what's left. "
good,"I dislike the management and the way the store is ran, therefore i am seeking something new. I like the people i work with and enjoy my job and tasks i preform. I don't agree with the way management runs the store."
good,"Besides closing the Pleasanton corporate office, Safeway became a great place to work over the last 5 years.  The culture improved and the compensation improved.  The only place to apply now is for the Northern California Division or the at the Store."
good,"Working at Safeway was very fun, given that I had wonderful coworkers. The management could be much better; seems like every store was short-handed on regular workers as well as Managers. Job/Life balance went out the door as soon as I was seen as dependable. I was hired part time, given that I am a college student. I'd work an average of 35-42 hours per week, and I was part-time. Hardest part of the job was handling special orders. Most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers and the friendly customers. I learned quite a bit from Safeway; how to cook seafood, how to prepare/cut fresh fish, filing, doing invoices, and preparing perchandise to be sold. It was an enriching experience, but Safeway is definitely not for everyone. If you aren't prepared to dedicate the majority of your time to the company, don't even bother with it."
good,My time at Safeway was very enjoyable and fun. All the people that worked there were very friendly and very helpful. My work environment was safe and I felt very welcomed.
good,Great people to work with. Understanding management. Wonderful leadership. Lots of team effort. I just get too many hours and need a set schedule.
good,Safeway at one time was a great company to work for but over the years it got worse.It become a hostile and unsafe place to work.
good,"Customers drive you crazy they are rude and disrespectful. if its any indication the employees call this company ""slaveway"". this job is not worth the money. and the hours suck."
good,"Safeway was a great company prior to the current changes due to the merger. I'm not sure what the company will be like once everyone settles into their new roles but it definitely was a great place to start my career. During my time here, I have met some incredible people that have made work enjoyable. I was able to gain various experience in my role."
good,"Packaged and prepped bakery items and wrote names on birthday cakes for customers, I learned how to cake decorate and make donuts. The management was good and so were the team members we always worked together to make sure there was always enough bread and food product on our bakery's sales floor. Hard days were when someone was coming to pick up a cake that was never made for the customer and the cake decorator was off that day. The enjoyable part of that situation was calling another store and finding out she had ordered it through another Safeway branch and she happily thanked me for calling and left to get her son's first birthday cake."
good,"I worked at a grocery warehouse that supplied various groceries to local supermarkets.  The typical day at work would be to stack various produce and canned goods onto pallets and to prepare them for shipment."
good,"Lot's of difficulty hiring and retaining technicians and difficult, if not impossible, to get coverage when ill.  Pay is great."
good,cashier handleing daily cash dealing with day to day problems in the store  managment was friendly and  the hours were great but cut down
good,Interacting with the customers on a daily basis was very rewarding. The children who came into Chuck E. Cheese were always so excited to be there which made working there a lot more enjoyable.
good,It was ok working there but it was not what i really wanted and the pay need to be a little better then what it it the co-workers are great thou
good,"Management is generally reasonable, depending on the specific store or department that a person is working at. "
good,"The Safeway store I worked at was the store my late grandfather worked before he passed away. Feeling like I'd accomplish some semblance of ""continuing the legacy"", I took a job there as a courtesy clerk. Granted, the job was fairly easy: gathering carts, bagging groceries, assisting customers and cashiers, keeping the place clean, and doing pretty much any little task that my superiors asked of me. I met some very good friends at that store and it was actually more painful than I expected when I told them ""good-bye"". However, management proved time and time again that its attention was on the wrong aspects of the store. The shelves in the store were old and falling apart, the work schedules were frequently placing too little cashiers at a time and interfering with my college class schedule, and whatever change there was done always seemed to be more of a quick patch job than a long-term fix. The hardest part of the job seemed to be dealing with trouble customers. Many times, there would be someone with an attitude that demanded 150% customer satisfaction, but I always fell back on my professionalism and never lashed out verbally and did my best to make sure all customers were satisfied, even the bad ones. The most enjoyable part of the job though was my coworkers. If I hadn't made such good friends at that store, I don't know if I would have lasted as long as I did. Being around people who are happy to see me really helps with the working spirit."
good,I learned the grocery business. The most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with repeat customers on a first name basis.
good,"After coming from an advertising agency career, I found the culture to  somewhat forced. The work could be rewarding if you pushed for what you believed and the friends I made, made it all worthwhile."
good,"First let me say that corporate Safeway is actually a great place to work.  The people are excellent.  However, the management culture grew over the years to one of cronyism.  Advancement was tied more to who you had lunch with or sucked up to than to actual performance.  Let me say, this was not why I left.  I simply retired.  "
good,I was enjoy working at there because I been see a lot of people came and  shopping at the store. Especially when I heard and see their smiles or thanks words from them.
good,With the right manager you might succeed. You can learn anything you want to.  Coworkers were basically great to work with.  Most departments were nice to work for but some are not.
good,"I've been working for Safeway for 10 years, going on eleven years. my job as a cashier is easy going but could be better. I pretty much get along with all my coworkers and managers. i have excellent relationships with customers. Recently the company reduced a large amount of hours which is very overwhelming and frustrating. As of now because of low hours i'm seeking new employment"
good,"As a baker, your day can start very early. A typical day consists of preparing all baked goods for the day and waiting to customers as needed."
good,".Safeway needs to weed out bad managers. They drive out experienced workers, and hire kids for cheaper labor costs."
good,All I am going to say is I found working at Safeway stressful and I did not like the environment I was in.
good,"Managing multiple employees, juggling HR/Security issues, customer service, P&L, Health dept, and company audits."
good,"If you have no idea what you want to do for a living, or you pursue your dreams outside of work, Safeway is a good company to work for. However, I am working here to pay the bills while applying for a totally different industry. "
good,"Regestering & checking out customers."
good,"Though I found I liked to work with everyone at Safeway I found the job to be very stressful at times. It is not always easy moving up or advancing within the store unless you are a pest. However, it gave me very good life training and pushed me to realize I could learn any job. If you are ready and willing to work hard and challenge yourself then it is a very good place to start but I would not choice it if I had an alternative."
good,"Most enjoyable are the people you work with."
good,"My typical shift would start mid-afternoon. I would serve customers for around an hour, then I would restock the coffee bar. I would then clean the coffee bar, then tale a dinner break, then serve customers until closing. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a late night rush. Typically I am preparing for closing, when many people would show up at once. I then had to work quickly to serve them all, then would need to get back to closing. The best part were the people I worked with. If where I work has good people working as well, I would enjoy it."
good,"Safeway, through my two year experience would be the perfect first job. You learn team work, time management, customer service skills, and you learn the meaning of hard work. As a courtesy clerk, you push cart, bag groceries, and sweep floors, sounds simple right? Wrong, you also have to deal with customers, and not ever customer is friendly, you have to learn to remain nice and help as much as you can even if you think the person is rude. This job gives you character skills. Say you're promoted to a GM clerk after you're 18 birthday and now you're working in the deli, you are not going to learn fryers, ovens, but hot cases, cold cases, cheeses, meats, how to make sandwich, register, and bailers too. Its great for starters but the management, well at store 1259 from 2013 to current (2014) has been slightly unstable, with lack of communication, and poor scheduling, other then that its a great company to work for, for a first job."
good,The typical day was keeping to myself and work hard. With Bskery and Courtesy clerk. Being a courtesy clerk was hard because no one cared about how you felt.
good,Enjoyed interacting with new and old customers having them tell me how great a job I was doing.  For the most we share cooking ideals and techniques.
good,It was an experience.  I loved working with the Customs Brokers they were a lot of fun!
good,"I would come do my sales to purchase and review to purchase to sales ratio get my total distress and pull all of the bad product off the sales floor ,then order .Then i would fill my stand and interact with customer."
good,The hardest part of the job is receiving additional training due to the fact that cross-training is not a priority for every manager. The job itself is not very challenging so it is hard to prime yourself to move up to the next step.
good,"Safeway can be a fun place to work with the different opportunities but it seemed as if change was needed, it would be met with resistance.  Opportunities are available but you must seek them out as well be prepared for any resistance to change."
good,"Great Job with min wage pay. Management was very unfair and treated employees wrong, unless a union rep was there with you."
good,The hours were somewhat flexible.  The union was unresponsive to concerns.  Usually did not work with the boss so I was allowed to work with many different people and freedom to do my work.  Usually good instructions as to what is expected of you.
good,"This job was a good experience for me, I've learned to communicate better and provide an excellent customer service for each person. The environment is lame, small store and parking lot. It's good that we're always busy but at the same time we are also short handed in staff. There are some coworkers who are fun to work with others are very lazy and unmotivated."
good,"In my 24 years at Safeway, I have learned a lot of different skills and the joys of caring for customers.  "
good,"All employees treated with respect, tended to over staff which resulted in not enough hours given."
good,safeway was an okay company to work for. hours were never the same it was always up and down depending on the time of year
good,"Taking in deliveries and replenishing shelves,making sure the shop was clear of ang rubbish before the customers entered"
good,"I deal with customers all day, my co-workers are great. Management is okay, The pay is terrible and what I enjoy is helping customers out."
good,"not bad I guess, my immediate boss is best boss I ever worked for, store manager is ridiculously unprofessional power happy freak."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is being able to sit and talk to coworkers all are very friendly and very outgoing.
good,I learned a lot about working with people and about how a store runs.
good,"It was a wonderful first job to have the experience was very helpful. This job made me work hard and be a part of something,"
good,"I found the work very useful, and a early step to developing communication and working skills."
good,a typical day at work for me is trying to discover new things to learn to a particular project that was assigned to myself.
good,good management got along with staff & customer's well.Which made it a good environment to work for.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers, taking their drink order, cashiering, and making their beverage of choice. I also cleaned the kiosk when things were slow. "
good,"This company focused on Customer Service, if you didn't provide better customer service than you'd be out of luck"
good,"worked in the Bakery packaging bakery goods, cleaned stocked bakery for the following day. Assisted customers."
good,"1. Was very typical and simple"
good,"I was the closer, so i had all the late shifts with plenty of Over-time, but even with OT it didn't pay enough for the stress."
good,working at safeway was good way to gain costmer service and metting people great job to work while a student
good,Working at safeway and being happy with your job is all based on what store you work for and how managment treats their employees. Safeway is a good company to work if you get lucky and work with managment who cares about their employees more then how fast they can climb up the corprate ladder
good,"A company that is customer service based. Very busy all the time. Store management is great, most co-workers are like family. The hardest part of the job is handling rude people. The best part of the job is the friends I have made."
good,"Very demanding, but that depends on the individual store. They will push you on the local level to be everything the company wants, but not give you anything more to accomplish those goals with."
good,"Like any job, it has it's positive and negative aspects. What I enjoyed the most was working with a strong team on the night shift. It was also nice when we could serve customers in a timely manner which was not always the case since there had been cut-backs and we were short staffed most of the time."
good,"I have learned a lot at Safeway, they gave me the chamce to learn valuable skills that I can take anywhere I go."
good,"Everyone needs a grocery store. Best place to buy your fresh fruit, ground meat, frozen food, and various dry goods. Getting in and sticking with it, can lead to great benefits and pay rates, but of course you have to start in slow and at the bottom. Its quite rare to be able to get into a store setting without being a courtesy clerk. But after shopping at various Safeway's and other rival grocery stores, family values are key for success amongst co-workers, even more so than in other jobs. Yes the store may be large, but you will see a person multiple times a day, and having an issue with them won't make it easy. On the flip side, it could make your day happier and brighter."
good,"I have learned a lot at Safeway: Being responsible for specific duties and completing them in a timely manner, working with others to accomplish tasks at hand, and working with customers to supply whatever needs they might have at the time."
good,"nothing to write home about, you deal with good customers and bad customers, good coworkes and bad one, good managers and bad ones. you just have to take it one day at a time. good for students as willing to work around your schedule. not good (unless manager) if you are trying to make it your primary income as hours are hard to come by."
good,"Large retail company which leads to treating employees as replaceable. Do not recognize years of service, leads to most senior employees to leave the company."
good,"Everyday is different which makes it great, you'll learn something new everyday. Most of the management are fair and honest and work together as a team. The co-workers are great and friendly it's like one big family, the hardest part is all the paper work and the best part is working with others and interacting with the customers."
good,"dealing for angry customers looking to return purchased items took up a good majority of my day. i learned that no matter what condition a previously purchased item is in upon return, the easiest thing to do is issue a store credit."
good,"Safeway distribution is a great place to work. I average an annual picking percentage of 115%. I worked very hard and efficient picking orders and was noticed by management and for that reason requested that I would train new employees. This job was very repetitive which became less motivating as the job also became hard on your body moving at fast pace working on concrete. Not only that, the picking shift had changed from a day shift to graveyard. Due to the shift change I had put in my two week notice. Management was respectable and complimented you on a job well done."
good,I typically come to work and ge assigned two or three aisles to stock each night
good,Mostly routine stuff. some Ad hoc here and there. Company is strict on dress code. Cant wear jeans or t-shirts. even if you never deal with vendors.
good,"It was working over night,at your own pace for the most part, worked with nice fun people, was great job outside of working overnight."
good,"I started my job as a day stocker in Vons, compare it to Ralfs I can tell it has more itmes in stock and it has a better variety of products. The interface is friendly , the environment is great. The only problem i can tell is with checkers and time management. I am an engineer so I see alot of time wasted between duties and tasks."
good,A fair place to work. Not a lot of room for advancement. A friendly safe environment that is under great pressure to perform. People are stressed due to limited hours.
good,"Stocked products in the store and made the work place look tidy before opening hours. I learned where products were in the grocery store. Management rarely communicated with me on night staff, but communicated with my supervisor. The hardest part was adjusting to night time hours. Most enjoyable part was working with the crew who made the job an enjoyable experience."
good,"Deli department is the busiest department in the whole store.Sometimes it can be a little stressful but you always have to have a positive attitude. You will have your good days and your bad days just like other jobs,will have conflicts with your manager and/or co-workers. But if you look at it, it is a life lesson. Since this is my first job, i have learned a lot in the work field. Being in the deli department for four years I've learn about costumer service,how to be a team player, and how to deal with certain conflicts."
good,"A typical day usually consists of a slew of checking people out and cashing in refunds and lotto tickets. I learned how to keep on a smile even in trying and stressful periods of time. The management is a mixed bag, varying from incredible to not-so-much. The hardest part of the job varies, and the most enjoyable is meeting nice people."
good,I started in the floral dept. and moved to the produce dept. . Learned how a much detail goes into setting up a grocery store.
good,· Checked out customer’s grocery.
good,"A typical day at work was helping customers, preparing food, cleaning, stocking and organizing. I did learn how to have great customer service skills but it wasn't because someone was teaching me it was gaining practice through interacting with customers. My immediate manager of the deli never really seemed to be around much. I usually had to talk to the assistant manager of the deli about any problems I had but she was never welcoming to talk to. My coworkers were really great and helpful, many of them should have been managers because they were doing the work of the managers."
good,"My work consisted of either working at 4am-12pm or from 4pm-10pm. Making 200+ sandwiches to be put out the next day. Preparing all types of foods using friers, ovens and cleaning all dishes with an industrial dishwasher. All while helping customers and answering the deli phone. You work solo for both of those shifts."
good,Good company from what i remember. They have a really good management team that are willing to help you out.
good,"A typical day would be, providing excellent customer service, bagging groceries as needed, helping customers around the store when needed an helping out in different departments in the store. I learned how to provide customer service an how to not be shy I definetly overcame my fear of always making the first statement. I enjoyed my coworkers to the fullest they were fun to be around an were always helpful. The hardest part of the job, was on rainy days being outside collecting the store carts. The most enjoyable was coming to work everyday an learning new things."
good,"Safeway for me was no hardship, I enjoyed interacting with customers and being part of the team but I also couldn't help notice unfairness in certain places, and hypocrisy among the supervisors."
good,learn how to accommodate customers and serve food. cook new breakfast foods and learn skill
good,"My typical day at work is well, pretty typical. It's the same routine every night. Sometimes that's a little stressing. My co-workers are good people and fun to be around, but are also there to work at our efficient pace. The hardest part of the job would probably be the fact it's an overnight job. Since night is when you would obviously sleep, working through the night can sometimes have it's affect on you (yawning, etc.). The most enjoyable part of my job is that it's a job with guaranteed hours. Not too many companies can offer that. Part- timers are offered 24 a week, but you can work past that time and make it a 40 hour week if u need to stay behind and finish more work."
good,This was my first job and i absolutely loved the people here. I didn't mind the work and I loved interacting with all the customers. It was a relaxed environment . I didn't like my hours and though I mentioned it to management numerous times no compromise was ever made. We were a bit understaffed so the workload was heavy I worked a 3 to midnight shift and would be the only courtesy clerk from 7-12. Though I asked for assistance none was given.
good,This company overall is a good company to work for depending upon your position. It is definitely a job that wants you to work hard and your best.
good,most enjoyable part of the job was making someone who was feeling bad or had been sick laugh and know that I cared about how they were feeling that particular day.  Another was having people know who you were after only talking to them on the phone but making that kind of impression on them and having them come in to pick up their prescription smiling and going about you and the call they had earlier with you.
good,"Worked for this company for almost 10 years, best appreciation I received was a lepelle pin after 1 year, nothing else, paid into employee benefits program and never received so much as a card for being in the hospital"
good,"If you do not tell management what you are willing to do, hours you are willing to work, they will work you 6 days a week and 8 hours a day. If they could, I'm sure they would work you every day. They do not pay overtime unless you work over 8 hours per shift. Sundays are in a different ""classification"" and don't count as a regular work day. Still not sure what that means."
good,"After working there for some time the store was under staffed and was needed people in other departments. I was asked if i would want to move departments with added hours, instead of being moved I was split between two departments with less hours then what I had and an inconsistent schedule without a two week notice of my hours. This continued for some time till i quit. Prior to the above statement we in the bakery had orders to fry an extra 30 to 50 dozen donuts for a different local store, daily and be ready before the store open, without extra time or  staff. Eventually the store even cut back the time we had to prepare for the store opening."
good,Worked there for a short while. It was a decent job with excellent. The management was pretty decent. Very rewarding after a hard day of working decent hours.
good,"Love my job, should have advanced more than i did. Looking for something more i can enjoy, and would love to do something that i can move around. The 11yrs i was there, it was good. Time to do something more rewarding, with better benifets. Better pay."
good,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude people. Most of the staff was very welcoming, although management had was gender biased as the women would be treated better than the men"
good,"This was my first job. It was good when I was 15, but wouldn't go back. I had to clean a lot and do tasks that I no longer think are worth the pay. But for older people working there they did get god benefits."
good,Low pay for what you have to deal with.  Some management is great others are not.  Employees are great to work with just ignore the negative talk and focuse on the job.
good,As a bookkeeper there is a lot of work and in the middle of trying to do it all your being called to check for only 12.20 an hour.Its a big possision to fill alot to pack into a shift
good,Work day depends on what I am scheduled to do that day. I may be in the front end or I might be in the produce department. What department I work depends on what hours are available.
good,"perfect job for a college, high school student. or somebody who needs good cheap healthcare. not a job you want to stay at for 20+ years anymore. laid back atmosphere"
good,"If it's a quick job you need its perfect.  Tops out at 21.00 per hour for supervisor,  can't go any hire than that unless you get into assistant manager which is still difficult to obtain . Because of merge with Albertsons it's more stressful and demands more out of the employees."
good,Overall good place to work. Peasant environment nice employees. Most enjoyable part is seeing all the regular customers. Hardest part is walking in expecting to work as one thing but the getting pulled to do something else. Management is questionable.
good,"For the short period of time that I worked there, I made some good acquaintances, as the company provides an environment in which employees get to interact with each other."
good,"Decent entry level positions in a variety of areas of the store. At times you are able to be promoted faster than anual wage increases, but not often. Wage increases come quite slow early on and take years to be anything close to meaningful.  Once capped out there is little reason to advance to higher level positions."
good,"Everyone will be really friendly, but if it works for theyre schedule, you could be upgraded to manager. They tried having me be manager without the pay because i had the experience and was leaving soon. Good temporary job, dont make a career out of it."
good,It was a great job as they worked out schedules around my school. They taught me a lot and I met a lot of people working there. It payed fairly well and had good bonuses.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of working 8 hour shift in the produce department stocking shelves. Being in produce forced me to also learn cashier, I am called whenever up front needs help checking customers out. It is rather annoying how much times I hear my name being called for help. Being called up front also prevents me from what I am really supposed to do which is produce. On top of that my coworkers can be rather lazy sometimes, including the manager, and I am to pick up there slack, which isn't fair to me. Also I am closing in the department so I am do do all the closing stuff on top of what I have to get done already. The hours they give you here are set, you either have morning, or evening shifts, there is no middle unless the department has the hours they can give. 2 People working in the huge department daily is rather messed up, especially with being called up front a lot. I would only recommend this job to anyone who has good work ethic."
good,"Enjoyed the staff and managers, the environment was clean"
good,"the overall environment was very good. All the co workers were very co-operative and friendly. had enough bereaks for long hours shifts.However, as a reputed company they should increase the minimum wage ."
good,I like my job like and get along with most co workers and customer. It's not the easiest job but it didn't make working there undesirable. Hold your own and improvement can allow for advancement
good,Low hrs and bad pay. Union dues and no hrs to pay for it. You do get a small employee discount. If you get a lot of hrs it will be because they have a visit coming from head quarters and after the visit is done then so are your hrs.
good,It was a good place to work. Most of the people were great which made it a nice place to work. I worked there for a total of 12 years. I was able to advance quickly. The benefits we're good.  This plant is closed now
good,"Like all corporations, Safeway treat their employees as fair as they can. Budget cuts are happening which makes it hard to keep up with all work and less help."
good,"It was an alright place to work. A lot of people complained about not getting the training they needed. I felt that some of that was true. A lot of it was more of a learn as you go kind of thing."
good,"Good job security, low stress, and understanding managers are great for people new to working, however low wages and inability to become full-time makes job undesirable for staying long-term."
good,I liked working here but the pharmacist allowed a couple older techs to be really rude and ignorant to a few of us younger ladies. They were really crabby with our customers as well. Cooperate never listens to regular employees only management.
good,"Management for my department of when I got relocated to work under the floral department, my boss for that department was very good and provided enough help where needed. I had learned many and very fascinating tasks while in that department. "
good,"A regular day at work is facing up the department first thing you walk in setting up the service case filling up/refreshing what belongs in there."
good,"My main duties as an Assistant Store Manager include:"
good,I have been with safeway for 10 years and i do enjoy it but the management turnover is rough. some managers make you feel good about your work and others accuse you of things without proof. typical day at my store is super busy and usual not enough people on staff.  during my union lunch i'm still expected to answer phones and help people. i get called and texted on my days off without pay
good,I enjoyed my time working for Safeway but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any room to move up. Good people but the corporation should honor it's employee's time better. At the end of the day I felt the Union took more than I received.
good,A typical day at work would be me entering to the department and looking around and seeing what customer needs my help first. Then I would help in the back most of the time take out the trash or wash dishes will my usual time of work. Management wasn't bad its just the communication between the department manager and the manager of the store was terrible and everything was all over the place. Hardest part of the job would have to be carrying heavy loads of stuff . Enjoyable part was if you actually got respectable customers lol .
good,"Safeway is a great company when it comes to the benefits they offer employees, but the lack of leadership and respect for the workers makes the work environment unhappy."
good,"A typical day at work is checking for carts, cleaning trash, and bagging groceries.  I learned how to clean.  The managers are demanding but fair.  Excellent people to talk with and talk to.  The hardest part of the job is tackling the challenges of the day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the comraderie."
good,"Being a worker who takes pride in his work, found it difficult to go above and beyond when the hire up managers don't take their job seriously. The store I worked at could have been at a much higher standard but Safeway refuses to take notice."
good,"As a Helper Clerk, I get pulled into various positions throughout the store. Primarily, I am scheduled as a courtesy clerk. I am paid minimum wage, and get very few hours. Weekly paychecks are nice to see, but the hours employees are provided is poor, with our company earnings not making up for expenses, and cuts being made constantly."
good,Arrive early to work get the job done and leave within 8 hours. Deal with management as best as possible. Interact with customers and help them find what they need.
good,"You will learn how to do a lot of different tasks, but the primary one here is Customer Service. With the wide variety of customers that you interact with, you will learn how to properly meet these variable needs in addition to making them happy. "
good,you have to be a hard worker do things like 20 times like cleaning bathrooms sweep stock push carts back in have a good additude  no arguing and no slacking  off
good,"Safeway was my first actual job out of high school, it was a great job. I only wished i got paid more, or worked more hours. I also wished they had employee discounts, because making as little as i was and having to pay full price for food was hard. But overall its a great starting job just so you can gain and collect work ethic."
good,"If you have great coworkers or the atmosphere of Safeway then you'll enjoy it, otherwise, there's not many benefits that are applicable. For the work that you are required to do, the pay is very little. I worked at Safeway in Seattle for a year, was at the level four pay scale in the union and made $15 an hour. I tried getting a transfer, and was only offered $11.40 an hour at a level two because I was told other workers would feel bad if I came in at $15 when they weren't making that much yet. I left."
good,I've worked for safeway for almost a year now it first i liked the job but then after it's gets really bad once you start to work me working there i never got bumped up to anything and even though i want to but they never did. So my hardest part working there is if your going to school sometimes  he doesn't work with it.
good,Very fast-paced definitely need to  have a good customer service.  Willing to learn more than one thing to do in the store.  Be happy and outgoing and always willing to help the customers
good,"Fun place to work. Diverse group of people to interact with on a daily basis. Store is well maintained and the equipment required to do the assigned task, is readily available. Safeway is community oriented with respect to special events that take place throughout the year. A safe and clean place to work."
good,It was OK working there. But when I went to move out of state they said I couldn't transfer out of state witch was false. Most of the worker were nice. The store was kinda not clean all the time.
good,"I've been working for the company for almost 6 years and the store i work at just continues to get worse and worse when it comes to hours. I'd only recommend this job as a temporary job if you're planning on going to school as they do try their absolute best to see that you're treated fairly."
good,"My experience working for the Safeway company was, in itself, just fine. I did have some issues learning the skills at first but many of my co-workers were willing to assist me to get the order right and to make sure the customer was satisfied. However, I was not told of some complaints made about me; nor was I given a chance to rectify said complaints through my own actions."
good,"It is a regular day on the go. Starting with a beautiful open heart,  smile and GM , checking  the hygiene and the outlook of the team and the workplace then making a plan for each coworker after doing the inventory and checking the floor and outside tables. Ordering after checking the freezers and the cabinets, checking the emails and the schedule, going on conference calls, checking the sales and the distress and trying to make some improvements, always watch the quality and communicate with the team... Help each coworker to finish their goal.... And fill up the tables because our goal is the customer and we need to make it satisfied and happy. The hardest part of the job is that you have a lot to do and you do not have the help needed and your manager is never happy!!!!  Some managers can't manage their stress so they think if they take it out on you they will be fine because they know nothing about leadership skills. Working with a team is for a certain part of time, but it is an experience that you will keep  in your heart for a lifetime and each and every member of this team is like a family member that stay in your heart and memories till the end of time. And the workplace memories never fade with all the struggling it's like home. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the feedback and surveys that they spend time to do it for you and when they call and are thankful about the products and the team members ! So you are proud of your team and this is the best feeling ever !"
good,"I worked in the Customer Service Department at a Safeway in Newport, WA. I enjoyed those I worked with and management was amazing. However we were a bit short staffed so I ended up doing as much, if not more work at times-- I felt-- as my department manager. Although at the tome I hated it, I learned a lot. It is a good job, with decent benefits."
good,I think Safeway is a great starting point for someone trying to dip into the work force. In my experience they have great employees working for them as well as good health benefits. They are also very good about working with your schedule if say you are still in high school.
good,"The job itself was not bad, it was  very straight forward and easy. All that was required of you was cleaning, stocking, and bagging. The only issues I came across was that I was not getting many hours and I was required to join a union and pay dues which meant I was not making much money. Also the management refused to listen to my scheduling requests, I informed them that I could not work during certain hours of the day because of school and they continued to schedule me during said hours. So I was constantly in trouble for skipping work, but in reality I was just in school."
good,"Honestly, it's a good job to have if you're in school or in between looking for full-time. It's a relaxed environment and you get to meet a lot of people. The drawbacks are little to no benefits, you get awful hours if you don't have seniority, and the customer is always right even when they're blithering idiots. It's a simple way to make money."
good,"Brick and Mortar retail is a dying industry. There isn't anything that Safeway is doing differently than anyone else. That is the problem."
good,"Days consists of balancing customer service with making drinks and maintaining a clean work space. Management was somewhat disorganized at times due to a lack of consistent staff. There was a lot of time spent working alone, mainly during opening and closing shifts."
good,"Very business like, most don't leave their offices or cubicles. Communication could be better. This could be due to high expectations within a very competitive and changing market environment."
good,"Safeway is an alright place to work. The people are great, but the job itself is a little tedious. They give many closing shifts, and make you start early the next morning, which can get VERY exhausting. Also, you don't get a raise once you get promoted to customer service, and I don't think that is very fair since you have 10x the responsibility."
good,"typical day at work was constantly moving. helping customers with finding an item or giving them rain checks, cleaning aisles, bringing in carts, ringing up customers"
good,The job itself is a great environment . Normally slow during the week and busy around Fridays and Saturday nights . The management was ok. My department was understaffed.
good,I learnt a lot from working for safeway and being one of their manager in traing employees. I learned that you need to learn most things on your own because they wont teach you and your most likely going to get yelled at if its not right. Youll also get demoted if a friend of theirs needs a job.
good,"Over-all the company has good pay and benefits. Being retail based you sign up to work all holidays, all year. The environment is faced past and ever changing which I find enjoyable. Customer satisfaction is a high priority with emphasis on speed of check-out and competitive pricing. With desire and ambition you can move up through the ranks rapidly with daily commitment to do your best."
good,Safeway is job that gets better the longer you are there as long as you have a good work ethic. Also you need to very flexible as you go to get hours. If you cross train then you make yourself more valuable. Sometimes management can project unrealistic expectations but it's on you on how you react. If you prove that you know what you are doing they leave you alone. Yes it all depends on department  and head management but if you talk to them regularly it works.
good,"It was a good learning experience and overall I'm happy with  my time there, I ran into some communication issues with my manager but besides that everything was fair and the job was pretty much what you would expect."
good,Safeway was an ok place to work for the hours were Spit Shift and Safeway would Cut working Hours at anytime.The manager was kind of different with an attitude of if you dont like the hours then leave.
good,"first job in a grocery store, felt very welcome and overall good morale,but when new management takes over,things tend to change and newer management did not care if they got rid of long time workers just get new workers in to pay them low wages,was not impressed with the company after awhile."
good,"The job was okay it didn't stand out much. Co-workers weren't driven as much as others and it added onto my work load often. However, the job did help me become more detail-oriented."
good,You learn a lot of things in this company but it’s very hard trying to be promoted and grow within the company. Expectations are truly highly expected
good,it was a fun place to work until Sobey's took over and then everything kinda went down hill after that. I didn't feel like I was valued as an employee anymore. We used to have an employee discount. But they took that away as soon as they took away the loyalty program. that was just the first of many things that Sobey's changes. I ended up with really really bad anxiety about working and. the best part of the job was the people i met when i was there. the hardest part was also the people i met when i was there. the managment never seemed to care about employee moral. and when things were brought to their attention nothing was done with the complaints.
good,"A typical day of work primarily focused on helping customers by bagging their groceries. Every hour I would walk up and down each aisle of the store pushing a broom making sure their were no spills and help any customers who needed assistance. Afterwards, I would go through and clean the restrooms each hour then go outside to retrieve shopping carts. I would then if it were slow go put back items to the shelves that customers didn't want; put back broken items to the back of the store for processing."
good,Working with Sobey's was a good opportunity to work and learn future employment skills.The hours were good and my department manager was a good boss and team leader.
good,A regular work day at Safeway is fast paced and You're constantly busy. There is always something that needs to be done. It's a very clean environment and very friendly.
good,It was quite a learning experience in the areas of customer service and retail.
good,"I enjoy working, but did not enjoy working at safeway. You can work as hard as you want but the advancement is all based on seniority, even if you work harder than a person who was hired 2 days before you they would get the better position before you would be given the chance."
good,Safeway concentrated on customer service so it taught you how to talk to people and patients on how to deal with difficult people management was understanding for the most part. it also had very mixed ages of employees
good,I will start of by clocking in and quickly going to my department of the day. I would make sure that everything in the department was neatly and faced correctly.
good,"When you need to get some experience under your belt, its a great place to start. Management was mostly decent and helpful. The schedule was flexible. Co-workers generally had a positive attitude and made the job fun."
good,"I've worked at two different Safeway stores during my time there, and the pace, tone, management and everything were all different, the long and short of it is that Your experience can either be immensely pleasurable or just the absolute worse depending on the store."
good,Safeway is a very good starter job because you don't need experience. I went in person and gave my resume and about two weeks later i got a call for an interview. Got hired on the spot. I liked about 90% of staff that was my favourite thing about the job. I hated customers because they always claimed on how their groceries were packed. Breaks were usually on time and it was a friendly environment to work.
good,I enjoyed working at Safeway's pharmacies until my last pharmacy manager and it was purchased by Albertsons.  The benefits were good and very low to pay for from my salary.  I got to know my customers and co-workers.  I felt very team oriented working with the pharmacy.
good,"I thought that the job was very exhausting even though I was only a cashier.  Like when there wasn't enough cashiers they would hound you to stay longer. I never got off on time. "
good,"Had I been able to stay, I would have. I loved my coworkers and even on stressful days it was not that bad. I learned a lot about how to manage and train employees, how to place orders, how to improve my customer service skills, and honestly the hardest part of the job was making sure that no matter how busy we were that everything was done and done correctly and efficiently."
good,"Departments require much more foot work and labor than up front. Front of store (Cashiers, Baggers, office, etc.) requires dealing regularly with customers, sometime upset, which can be stressful."
good,Cool place to work and ok pay. A lot of work and room to advance. Everyone there is very helpful and willing to learn. The hardest part is to make sure everything gets done on time.
good,"my time at cons was spent dealing and interacting with customers in many different ways. in my time there i learned lots of tricks to the trade and how to prioritize my day efficiently. the culture at cons was cool its at the beach so folks are mellow. loved being able to get off and hit the waves, got lots of side jobs from the locals too"
good,"If you're looking for employment with great benefits Safeway is the place to work at.  Every position there requires standing your entire shift. some require lifting either mild or strenuous, not recommended if you have a bad back."
good,"Lived working at Safeway and meeting new customers all the time but also having regular returning customers, met some awesome co workers, and the managers were somewhat flexible"
good,"I've worked there for almost ten years and for the first five it was a really great place to work, really flexible with the hours(which it still can be, but perhaps too much), there was a great group of people I worked with throughout the whole store not just my(the deli) department. After year five it started slowly going downhill, probably due to lack of sales. Started cutting hours and too much shuffling around of full time staff with frequent manager swaps for poor reasons, poorly trained managers. My store especially seemed to have a lot of staff shuffled through and had hours drastically cut. You were consistently working short staffed and constantly rushing around. Nothing would ever get done due to business and no staff around but you would still be treated as if you weren't doing your job properly. Then after some time instead of that, more work would be forced on the more competent/capable employees thus giving us more work and higher expectations than other people. And this all got much worse after Sobeys bought out Safeway. So basically, five years ago, I would highly recommend a job at Safeway, but no longer."
good,"There is typically not much going on on your average day at work. The employees are generally friendly, the customers lodge complaints relatively often (argue about pricing, etc.), however the management is ready to help at the drop of a hat and are, in general, good at their jobs."
good,Hardest part of the job is the constant changing of leadership to be able to maintain profits in the grocery industry. Depending on area clientele is not always the friendliest.
good,The workplace all kind of people. It is a very diverse workplace mixed elderly and youth. It provides experience for the next workplace that anyone wants to work at. Very friendly staff and management.
good,My overall experience with safeway is okay. I've requested more hours and have not gotten any. My only income is covering for other employees shifts..
good,It was an easy place to work with but poorly managed. Most of my co-workers were nice but some were highly child-like. The management was well around the store but never listened to many suggestions and wouldn't pay you very well unless threatened to leave.
good,"Good place for a student to work, with adaptable hours and part time benefits provided by the union. Great environment to work on people skills and room to grow into different departments of Safeway."
good,"I love working there, but management was terrible. They treat you like a slave, they didn't show that they cared about the employees.I don't regret working there because I have a little experience now.\"
good,"I as a night stocker for a summer. We worked anytime 7pm to about 8pm. Working during the night time was tough. We were asked to be quick with our stocking. Once a person memorized the isles of where products went, this job wasn't hard. There was only four of us. I was the youngest one by far. My co workers were anywhere from 30 years old to almost 60 years old. I'm just in my 20s. Even though there was a age difference I was able to get along with all my coworkers."
good,"If you can work at Safeway you can work anywhere..this is what I was told when I first started working for Safeway. Every Safeway is different, while working in my hometown the job was really fun, great team, and customers I've known my whole life. Working at Safeway in Colorado was a 180 degree change."
good,"It is a decent place to start making money, when starting to work, or in desperate need of a job, but it isn't the best environment to stay long term."
good,"Working long hours"
good,The workplace culture was well organized.  Management did a good job making sure they accommodated every employee meeting their needs.  I learned a lot about establishing great customer service.
good,"Very fast paced & physically demanding. Some rude customers. Management is kind and cares about your schedule, and other staff is very kind. Start out working many later night shifts."
good,"Enjoyable coworkers to an extent, the many tasks helps the day go by fast though a special level of patience is needed if you plan to work here, pretty good hours."
good,Service huddles are held daily to motivate employees and brainstorm on how to continuously keep customers satisfied. It is a positive uplifting environment.
good,"Safeway is a great place to work if you want to have a consistent schedule. They are always in need of help, so the ability to work long hours is there."
good,Busy but well balanced days with good team work. I enjoyed the work structure and the good management of the company. Rewarding experiences with the good service we provided to our patients.
good,I really enjoy working with this company very nice people. I'm only a temp and hope I can get hired on permanent. Love my hours just hate the commute on raining days overall ive learned a lot of new things
good,"a typical day at Safeway, we would usually start out with helping up front with checking people out. by the end of the day i would usually be stocking shelves or checking inventory. i loved being able to help customers, but highly disliked when i would get that one rotten egg."
good,Working with public was a plus. Being able to help people with their choices and enjoying feed back from those choices. Hardest part of job was having to be at work by 4am but loved working with public.
good,"Its a good company, hired me fast and got to work fast. Good pay, and the management is really understanding and nice willing to work with your schedule and things you have going on."
good,at night your allowed your own space and you work at a moderate pace to ensure your work gets done. you are allowed to be yourself a lot more at night and its peaceful and quiet
good,Systematically help work product every day to either prepare for the next business day or that business day. Excellent managers but the hardest part is definitely the balance of figuring out what needs to get done and what you want to get done
good,"Working in the department can be very stressful. If you take pride of your work, you want to show them that you're doing a good job. But that becomes a big challenge because this company is all about cutting hours and adding more labor. As your department is getting less hours, your employees will end up looking for a another job. Safeway is always short on staff and customers will always complain about not getting help. As an assistant produce manager, I take pride what I do, but the Safeway corporate don't care how hard you work. They only care what is not done. Working here is place where they will never appreciate what you have done for them. No matter how positive your sales and rating are, they will find something just to say You Suck in professional way."
good,"I definitely learned a lot and grew from all the situations I've had to handle at this work place. Majority of the time you would be doing more than one job including cashiering, running customer service or working as a courtesy clerk. It was a hard place to work but i enjoyed the difficult situations as it helped me to grow and learn how to quickly solve any problems. I worked very hard and tried to over achieve my goal. I got along with mostly all my co-workers so we could have communication which is key."
good,There are very few consistencies with this work. Management are great people but expect a lot out of their best workers. Those who are on the other end of the spectrum are in a safety net.
good,"was opener at safe-way, fun and easy going job. Would recommend for anyone looking for a side job. Management was good. Fast pace environment."
good,"Great Leadership"
good,"I love getting groceries from Safeway, as far as working for them was a complete mess. Way to much favoritism, and unorganized as far as what duties is assigned or how long our breaks were and there was no training, just went in head first. Didn't really like the job."
good,"A fast paced work environment, the regular customers and fellow employees make this job worth while. Schedules are variable and are posted on Thursday for the following Sunday."
good,"I proved myself and moved up pretty well while working there. My manager was really cool and I do have to give him credit. He tried to get another new supervisor and I the pay we deserved, but corporate wouldn't budge. It also consumed all free time I had because they had a seniority system and the people that worked there longer got what they wanted. The assistant manager did not like hiring students for this reason."
good,"awesome place to work, need to get better on doing the check up the trucks, but other than that, its all good."
good,"I have learned that the job is not only about your team, but to keep the customer coming back and saying ""I shop from here""."
good,"Work hours are flexible, little to no opportunity for growth at this company unless you're favored by management. Overall its a good company to work for."
good,very busy job for checkers. Not enough checkers at times which can may a typical day very frustrating. Management was very nice.
good,"I feel my job was very skilled. I was a florist, I made bouquets and arrangements but  I was also expected to drop everything and provide customer service at all times. We were worked like dogs and our time restraints weren't respected at all. If a manager made a mistake blame was placed on me. Like being a slave..."
good,"this is a good place to work if you get into a store that's not on low end of sales,customer service ect. you can expect to work hard no matter what but the store and dept. managers  make or break your experience working for this company"
good,"Great company to work for work life balance is less than desirable often working weekends nights. Often times required to work a double shift due to people calling off making it hard to plan for a life outside of work. Managers are not team players, very seldom willing to come in and roll there sleeves up to solve problems, and delegate to the lead and supervisory staff."
good,"At Safeway, a deli clerk was responsible of keeping up proper food safety standards in a kitchen environment. I also did routinely cleaning, food prep, operated a manual register, and practiced customer service. My coworkers and I got along well, because we all did our work. The hardest part of the job was the cleaning duties and keeping on schedule with them. Safeway was my first job so I learned tons about team work and time management. The most enjoyable part of employment with Safeway was the familial staff and crew."
good,"servicable servicable servicable"
good,Overall a good company to work for. There is great room for advancement and they expect a lot from employees.  Compensation and benefits can make up for it however. Schedules are flexible and majority of coworkers are friendly and hard working.  Wonderful place to meet and interact with a wide variety of customers from all walks of life.
good,"helpful management sometimes, co-worker provide helpful tips, customers are happy with my service. Now working at safeway very stressful. We cannot help customers as soon as possible. Because there are not enough employees to help them."
good,Typical work day started early and generally went well. I enjoyed the friendliness of most of my co-workers.  Though the day started extremely early hours worked well with my schedule.
good,"Safeway, Inc. is an American supermarket chain that was acquired by private equity investors led by Cerberus Capital Management in January 2015. The new merged company which includes the Albertsons supermarket chain has more than 2,200 stores and over 250,000 employees[2] which makes it the second largest supermarket chain in North America, after The Kroger Company, which has 2,625 stores.[3] Safeway's primary base of operations is in the western and central United States,[4] with some stores located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Eastern Seaboard. The company is headquartered in Pleasanton, California."
good,"bagging groceries"
good,"I specialize in customer service and have a great relationship with my customers.  I have been put in charge of the front in at least once a week and ensure other cashiers get lunches and breaks in a timely manner.  I am professional in my actions and interactions and assure my tills balance every shift I work."
good,"Working at the Safeway Deli, wasn't necessarily the Deli its self that was bad. We had some really good customers and the work wasn't bad for the pay i got. But some customers were a pain, and the coworkers would never listen or make logical decisions."
good,A fast pace working environment that focuses on the customers. The job is hard only when a customer is in a bad mood and decides to take it out on you.
good,"Since started working during my high school years, I'd learn a lot of experience. From being independent with handling money, to helping customers in need of any assistance, there was so much to enjoy working with employees. There may be some harsh times in which I did make mistakes, but I've made the right choice to work at an entry level to gain experience, while working with different people and their attributes to the company."
good,"Long hours, personal satisfaction of enhanced sales and customer satisfaction, nice benefits, helpful key staff, opportunities for advancement"
good,"Fun place to work with lots of team spirit making working along side colleagues very satisfying and enjoyable.Some politics and perhaps excessive or redundant rules,but bearable.I miss many friends that i had such a good time with."
good,"Customers were amazing and friendly, which made it easy to do my many jobs. However team members had very low work moral do to feeling unappreciated by management, which made it a drag to come to work half the time."
good,"Safeway has a friendly environment. Employees and customers get's along. Safeway would go an extra mile just to give a customer a satisfaction shopping experience. I've learned that the employees attitude and customer service reflects the number of sales and people who shops In the store. The co-workers are friendly they try their best to keep the environment friendly as it can be. Management always recognized when you are doing something good. They also keep you updated on what needs to be done. Hardest part of the job would have to be  the change of view of other shoppers who likes other establishments more, or feels like Safeway don't have nothing to offer. We usually sell them products that are similar. What I enjoy about Safeway is that you connect to the community, the costumers soon become regulars who loves to come for great talk and great sales. I've learned how to sell items, also how to have great costumer service. I learned how to prioritized my time and work faster and harder."
good,"The day mostly consisted of finding the right products for customers to help them relax and enjoy their night. However, some customers did not want to pay for their items and tried to steal, this happened at least once a week."
good,It's my beginning in Safeway. My new co-workers are willing to help me start my new work. But the schedule was not quite well at the beginning. And it's a little disappointed me that there's no employee discount in the store.
good,"My typical day was very hectic, I worked in 4-5 different departments every week. My main duty was customer service."
good,"Working here is great if you consider the customers and friendly coworkers. I really enjoy helping others with questions and concerns, and I've established bonds with many people there. I've always went the extra mile for my co-workers and the customers. It is a noble part of me which I am proud to sincerely admit I possess. But the store itself is understaffed. Management in most departments require one person to do so much in such a small time frame. It is difficult juggling customers demands, along with the core job duties. Management treats their employees as if they're just tools, inconsiderate to their well-being. More times than often they'd have one person working in more than 2 departments in 1 shift, and don't offer the workers extra pay, or even assistance in the actual department they initially signed up for. So that leaves the worker compiled with a list of things to do but so little time. Then the management has the audacity to sham and disrespect the worker for not getting their work done. This type of inconsideration is frustrating. Due to the store being understaffed the work was tough. You'll come across lazy coworkers who want to do nothing but complain and flirt with the customers, I enjoyed putting fresh product out for the customers, and I enjoyed communicating with them. What I learned was definitely patience, and how unreasonable management can be. I learned that they'll overwork you if you let them, and won't show any type of appreciation. They'll just continue to use you, and use you without any regard for you. They'll sugarcoat everything when in fact"
good,"The night crew was a closely knit group of people. Everyone mostly enjoyed the company of the others. Everyone enjoyed wry humor and were generally lighthearted. They were encouraging to work with. However, the night crew was not managed as well as it could have. The chain of command was unclear and indecisive at times."
good,great pay  and benefits including union protection after 3 month probationary period.  dont expect weekends off and forget your social life as you are always getting madnatoried to work on your days off. management is mean and treat you like a machine and talk down to you.
good,They didnt play their part on anything and the managers were very difficult to work for always harassing you for the hard work that you do.
good,"I have been working for Safeway Inc. for almost eight years. I have had some great experiences and skills from working for this company and I have had some bad ones too. I am looking for a job that is related to my degree which is in science, so working at Safeway is not my life and career goal.The store which I work at is not a very big store so a lot of the employees do extra work and don't have enough helping hands. I have seen fellow employees fired over minor things which happened because they were being too nice to the customers such as ringing up Safeway card for customers out of state. I have seen a lot of employees come and go and some have better jobs or have moved on in their job experiences. I am a very patient person and have patiently waited for my time to leave the store and company to pursue my goals in the field of science.I really would not fill accomplished if I worked there for the rest of my life, but I do appreciate all the skills, knowledge and great memory from working at this Safeway store."
good,Always had the feeling that I was irreplaceable no matter the circumstances. that is never a great feeling when you bust your butt so hard for a company. Typical work was 2:30pm to 11pm Tuesday thru Saturday. I worked for 4 years before I got 2 days off together. hardest part of the job was dealing with grown man drama like it was high school. I loved my job because I worked out while getting paid.
good,"Working at starbucks is a great experience it has taught me the meaning of good customer service. It has helped learn the meaning of team work. Working at starbucks can be stressful when you are alone and have a rush but it has also taught me how to handle difficult situations, for example; when i first started working at starbucks when more then two people would get in line I would have a small panic attack now the line has to be more then 10 - 15 people I know how to handle things by myself."
good,"The coworkers we're the best part about working at Safeway. More often than not, you will be on first name basis with upper management; even if you are a first time courtesy clerk. Usually the worst part about it, if ever, was cleaning messes and bad customers."
good,"help customers find what they are looking for or suggest other alternatives. Order product for the store, put away product, organize back stock, ring customers up as they are ready to leave the store"
good,"Safeway Wine & Spirits is an enjoyable place to work, the staff is fun to work with. The atmosphere is a learning experience with a variety of customers. From customer service to working stock, there was always a job to be done. A typical day involves, cleaning, rotating stock from the backroom to the front, building displays, and ensuring the customers always leave satisfied."
good,"Arrive very early and inventory remaining milk and write a milk order for the next day. Then you will start working through the daily perishable load. Write the remaining orders for the next day. As hours were slowly reduced over the last few years I was there the amount of checking done  increased dramatically making it difficult and frustrating to get your work done."
good,"Actually this is a great opportunity for teens and retires, back when I started it was a great start, fun, I was trained in every department, got to meet a lot of new people . I actually enjoyed working there, after a while the pay was good to, my only complaint was there wasn't enough hours to make a living. See, they go by seniority, so if you're just coming in then you may want to have a 2nd job to make ends meet. Other then that, great place to work at."
good,"A good driving job to work on your driving skills. the customers are overall most friendly. The co- workers are friendly, easy to get along with and very helpful."
good,"good company to work for pays good money, 15 min brakes and full hour lunch. be attentive to all customer needs and maintain flow of check out service.. nice management helped me move up and good insight on company goals"
good,"- work/life balance depends on your department"
good,"Worked with some wonderful co workers, loved working with the public. Days flew by so quickly because it was an extremely busy store."
good,"A typical day at Safeway you hit the ground running and do not stop until either the clock tells you to go home or the clock says it is time to close, for me it was the latter.  There was never a day at Safeway that I did not learn something about pharmacy.  My co-workers are really cool, on a bad day they can make you smile and on a good day you smile even wider.  The hardest part of the job, ironically, is also the most enjoyable part of the job....the customers."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of making sure the store was ready for opening. Entailing following up with all the sub departments. Make sure all the opening day SOP where up to par. Communicating with departments making sure all items are stocked and available. "
good,"day at work:"
good,"Produce department manager at two Vons (Safeway) locations in Southern California.  The job consisted of overseeing the produce department: Displays, Stocking, Customer service and Ordering."
good,Safeway is a good company. They just are hard to work with when it comes to working with family matters.
good,"A night at work involved easy lifting, placing stock of shelves. easy problem solving."
good,"How to deal with cash"
good,Supportive but depends on workers to work hard and together as a team effort at all times.
good,If you enjoy moving around in a company this is the place for you.
good,"It made me feel safe to know that Safeway was a union job, so if anything happened such as injury, they would help me out as much as possible. The best part of the job was being able to interact with different customers every day. You get to meet a lot of new people, and get to know a lot of regular customers. The hard part was being on call, and not having very regular shifts. Most of the time I wouldnt have any shifts scheduled, but would get a call every morning being asked to come in to work."
good,"same as vons. "
good,"Fair management. "
good,cool place to work at but the old people there always ruin it when you have too much fun.
good,pay is ok depending one the department you work in. most staff is nice to work with. depending on the manager the job is not always pleaset to be at.
good,"In my time with Safeway, "
good,this work was alright. I moved for something bigger and better then being a cashier at safeway.
good,"Very busy, aot to do in certain time frames."
good,"Typical retail job. Has its ups and downs. But like most retail jobs if you like the people you work with then its not too bad. Safeway used to be a good place for a career, but that has changed in the last 10-15 years. Two things that could improve are the low hours and minimum wage. If you're struggling or living check to check, then you might want to try elsewhere. The hours are mostly 30 a week or so (often less) and it can take years to make a few dollars an hour more than when you start out. Unless you are looking to manage a store, this probably isn't the best career path."
good,"Working in the deli was always busy.  I learned to make different kinds of recipes.  And developed my social skills, like dealing with new and regular customers.  I had the best co-workers at that place.  Even the management was very considerate about my pregnancy while i was working there.  Hardest part of the job is when you get swarmed by customers and there wasn't enough people working to help you."
good,"Each day I would do chores and maintenance so the store would look good and run efficiently.  This included reshelfing products, cleaning, bagging, helping customers, pushing carts and taking care of trash.  Near the end of a long shift it could be exhausting.  Management was very accommodating with hours due to most employees being in school, but often there were not enough hours to pass around so paychecks looked bleak at times.  Since it was my first job over the summer I mostly learned how to carry myself professionally and how to manage my social time and work hours."
good,most enjoyable part of the job was speaking to the customers
good,"Hard work, you learned alot,good work co-workers,do not be late,the christmas partry"
good,Typical day at work would be busy since the moment you start people already asking you for help when your not even clocked in. I learned alot of cash handling. Hardest part of the job was handling the front end because it can get hectic. Most enjoyable was having my own office.
good,"Start the morning at 5am, prepped and cooked breakfast for the employees in the Safeway HQ in Bellevue. Once 10am rolls around I would prep and cook for lunch service. I enjoyed every moment of it but the drive from Auburn to Bellevue was the hardest part. But other then that it was a great place to work at."
good,I meet everyday with new challenges.  I really love the interaction with customers. I learned many things and was given the opportunity to move up the ladder at a fast pace.  I have done many things at Randalls from cake decorating to upper management and loved every new challenge. 
good,"While working at Safeway my daily duties including bagging groceries, replacing items, providing great customer service at all times, and helping customers when needed."
good,"My day at Safeway depending on the shift that I'm working. I usually work the morning shift witch consisted of colleting carts, stocking and cleaning bathroom's, bagging grocery's, and sweeping/mopping the store. These task give you the opportunity to take time out to get to know the customer  better and better meet there needs. I learned a lot of good things at safe way i picked up customer service skills and custodial skills. At Safeway the management where understandable and always very friendly with the customer. they where what brought the winning team of Safeway together. My co workers where hard working and a great team to work with. The hardest part about working at Safeway is around the holiday time it is a very fast past environment but,I always managed to  stay above the stress of thanks giving. I feel the most enjoyable part about Safeway was just all the great people I was given the privileged of meeting"
good,"Ringing up customers items, bagging items. Doing some basic math, a little bit of sales."
good,I was a book keeper at safeway temporary and i was never fully trained on my position for me to be able to complete my job correctly. 
good,This was my job during high school and for a few years in college. I work with a lot of interesting people. We were a pretty tight crew in the Starbucks and I am still good friends with many of the people I worked with. Working in the coffee shop I learned a lot about coffee and how to make a good cappuccino and late.
good,Enjoyed the fast pace environment. Meeting new people everyday and the regulars that came everyday. The benifits are good when you have worked with the company for a certain amount of months and paying into the union. Other than that it was definitly a great experience and another step into the direction of furthering myself.
good,"Good place to work if you have been there for years and have open availability, otherwise its a good place for high school students who want a limited schedule"
good,Stocking and providing superior customer service. Always satisfying customer needs. Working hard and as a team is the only way to make it through the busy days.
good,The customers are the best part of the day.
good,"Great co-workers, good customers, it can be hard at times. The deli is a busy fast pace work enviroment."
good,"working through the day, includes working with customers, and customer service. Bright atmosphere, usually filled with sunny dispositions. Customers dont often give much respect to grocery workers."
good,"Safeway was a fun place to work,but no advancement,insurance was no good.I love helping customers"
good,I was a Starbucks barista at Safeway and I was there for 3 years. Management was not great.
good,"Worked on Message broker 8.0 , Weblogic 10g."
good,"Safeway is a pretty good place to work, if you enjoy grocery stores"
good,• Provided excellent customer service in person
good,"It is always busy, no matter the time of day; even the day of the week. It takes a lot of patience and work to get throught the day. The co-workers and most customers, make it fun!"
good,"fast pace 40 below zero hard work.long hours,6 days a week ,12 hour days."
good,"Working at Safeway has been a good experience so far, getting to know my coworks and regular customers as well. The mangers even work with me because I am a college student."
good,"This company was more challenging, not being able to directly manage your associates. Due to Union involvement."
good,"Safeway as a company is a great starting point when you enter the world of work. It teaches you the basic skills of customer service and allows you to apply your knowledge of problem solving skills, and teaches you how a business should run. I have invested a lot of time with the company and enjoyed it thoroughly. However, I can not live and raise a family off of its income or benefits. Safeway is a fantastic stepping stone to gain the experience, knowledge and preparation to succeed in a life long career"
good,"It is hard to say, because I worked for several different managers. But for the most part, it was a secure union job. I did get paid quite well. The security was not good at all"
good,"I worked there almost 6 yrs before I found something else that I enjoyed. The place was very family friendly the management was great they were always helpful, and handled ALL of my concerns the first time around I would recommend them and I still do."
good,I’d recommend working here as a part time job full time is hard to achieve anymore. Very stressful a lot of the times but manageable for the most part.
good,"I had a great time at work picking up the responsibilities of cleaning that no one else has gotten the time to do, it gave me great pride to be able to help my store provide a cleaner,more sanitary dining and buying experience. Unfortunately since I worked at night past closing hours, there  had been a constant miscommunication with my start time. I was in college at the time so I took the opportunity to resign from safeway and pursue the full time student responsibilities."
good,"I enjoyed the experience, workers,  and customer relations. I was able to learn more about this industry and how it operates.  I advise against taking my opinion. Seek your own."
good,"I took this while I was in collage. There were fairly flexible with hours. It was lots of throwing load and stocking, but that was expected. I do suggest always dressing warm with this job."
good,"i highly recommend the floral department, great customer service expirience and co-workers are lovely. it gets pretty busy during the holidays and events which make your day go by quicker & you get to play with flowers!!"
good,I wouldn't recommend that anyone to apply for a job at the Clearlake Safeway. Do to the lack of respect for the employees. Hours fluctuate to where it was never the same weekly.
good,"Safeway should do a better job in hiring people especially in their Dawson Creek pharmacy department. It's not the staff's fault that they don't have experience but I think they should not be working there if they are not familiar with the job or if the company is not willing to give them a good training because it can be a threat to public safety. They deal with medications, after all. Some of them also lack work ethics and sad to say, it's mostly the people who have been there the longest. How can they tolerate someone who's always late coming in to work and don't have customer service and who's always at the back not helping her co-workers? No wonder all of the good workers left. Don't they realize the public can see them?"
good,Start of day insuring shelves are fully stocked and if product missing tracking down as to why. Insuring all product ordered is accounted for and properly billed. Insuring all displays are fully stocked and properly priced. Having gone through six managers and various management styles made for difficult transitions. Dealing with a store manager vision and district manager vision was sometimes difficult as sometimes the visions were opposite. Most rewarding when I was able to find a compromise for both visions. Most rewarding for me was when customers complimented me on displays.
good,"Most coworkers are very nice and easy going. This job is hard on your feet since you're standing in one spot all day, at least there are mats though. Closing sucks because you have to refill front end fridges even though it isn't technically your job to and you have to find time to do it even when it's super busy. Very repetitive gets boring quick. there's an employee discount but you're not really saving anything because everything is so overpriced. discount is 10% Safeway bands and 5% on the rest but it is combined so you save like 50 cents."
good,"Regular days consist of stocking shelves, directing customers and organizing the backroom. I Learned many communication skills as well as how to be effective with my time. The workload was overwhelming at times but never exceeded my ability. The people working at Safeway are supportive, respectful and helpful to new employees."
good,"My coworkers are one of the only reasons why I still work here. Getting paid weekly is a nice incentive but when you can’t get raises and you’ve been there for years, it gets frustrating to still be making the same as someone who just started a week ago."
good,"I enjoyed working with fun, hard working people. we worked as a team to accomplish our goals. I also worked alone with limited supervision when needed. I became known as a very dependable worker. I was very accurate and fast at my job and had great customer service skills."
good,all in all this is a fine place to work if you don't mind monotony. But the job offers benefits and the hours are flexible. coworkers weren't to bad either
good,"On a typical day, I would bag groceries for the customers, clean up the store by sanitizing the bathrooms, taking out the trash, etc, pull in carts, and other miscellaneous responsibilities. The workplace was chaotic and stressful, and the hardest part of the job was dealing with the people I worked with. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits I received."
good,I enjoyed working for them it was a comfortable speed and the people where great to work for ivejoyrd the costomer service. And the hours we flexible..
good,"A typical work day at Safeway would consist of numerous tasks in the floral department, both labor intensive and creative. I really enjoyed the nature of my job yet working with the public was challenging. I really loved the store manager where I was at. She really cared and she worked hard with a smile on her face or a funny laugh she would often have. I learned that working for a large store like that wasn't the right place for me to be. The hardest part of my job was the overwhelming nature of peoples energy seeing that I am a highly sensitive person. It wasn't a good fit for the long run."
good,"Working at Safeway was my first real job. It wasn't terrible, it wasn't the best place ever, but my coworkers and a few of my supervisors made it fun."
good,"I was at a non union, I was promoted to manager 4 months into starting and had to run a department off of 3 people, being manager I was there 7 days a week for weeks on end. Turn over rate was very high."
good,"I believe safeway was good for a starting job, not a lifetime job unless you want a simple job. I feel that you can sustain this job and go to school."
good,"Learned patience,Management some are ok, workplace is great. Hardest is difficult Customers, most enjoyable is conversing with the regular Customers and co-workers"
good,I would not suggest working there to a friend as it takes years to get good insurance and the pay is very low to start and the rate of increase is long
good,"With any job, there are pros and cons."
good,"working for Safeway is not challenging, It can be stressful at times when corporate come into the store. but overall very easy. I managed the  frozen department, high expectations."
good,"Working at Safeway was a pretty standard experience for me personally, I expected what I had to do at my job, probably the hardest part was collecting carts from the parking lot, pushing 20+ carts in a row is harder than it looks. The easiest for me was bagging customers groceries, there's a guideline to follow which makes it easy. I learned how to catch somebody attempting to rob products and learned to pick up heavy objects using my legs, not my arms and back. My coworkers were friendly and the work environment is great."
good,"I do enjoy my job at Safeway. I love to thoroughly be able to get my work done, but when my department manager isn’t present, I feel too pressured by the store manager."
good,"As a personal shopper I started at 4 am to start picking. The store was mostly empty so that was nice. However, this department prioritized profit so they'd cut hours in order to profit from the service. We were always extremely understaffed and we'd either have to skip out breaks in order to get the orders out on time or let them be late and get asked by management why that was happening. You have to be fast, and rely on your coworkers to be fast. If you have a great squad then you're job will be easy, if you don't you'll hate it."
good,"Managed between 25-30 employees daily, wrote schedules for cashiers and courtesy clerks, hired and trained new employees. the most enjoyable part are the customers"
good,"greet and engage customers, follow instructions. Learned customer service is key to your survival the more competent you are with your work the more comfortable you feel handling customers."
good,"Typical an average day working at Safeway is pretty repetitive with exceptions.  when upper management comes in everybody gets stressed for no reason. they are always going to say something negative, but sometimes they do say something positive"
good,My first job while in high school. It paid well enough and my hours were just enough so that I had time for school. I liked my coworkers well enough but there was some internal issues with management.
good,"It was a nice experience working there. I recommended to everyone who wants's to have a job in the city. We can bid on shifts but then again so are several other employees. They always have jobs, paid on time weekly, always had my hours correct, friendly, and tries to help look for something i am interested in, make sure that the employer is treating us right"
good,"I worked for Safeway for four years and it helped me improve skills such as problem solving, customer service, as I had to work in stressful situations. The staff helped me grow as an individual and it was fun working in a positive environment with great management. The company itself is outstanding, the hardest part about the job was being able to satisfy every customer. Regardless, it taught me how to be more empathetic towards other people and genuinely provide good service."
good,"Many different job titles and typical day varied depending on position. Learned much about the grocery business, especially about inventory. Management was varied depending on the store and the type of manager you had. Working as a checker was the most difficult  because of the long hours standing and till accountability. Made some great friend with fellow coworkers."
good,I remember when I called in because my cousin got hit by a car riding her bicycle. The manager at the time was very unhappy with me because I was not able to show up. I would not recommend working for a place where they don't believe family comes first.
good,"the company has dress code, code of conduct, fast paced, flexible work schedules, management is inconsistent, employees are by and large friendly. The customers can be hard to handle at times but management is very supportive in this area."
good,Safeway is a great place for work. Opportunities exist for person from all walks with any level of skill. With plenty of room to learn the business and gain additional responsibility.
good,"Safeway has become increasingly disappointing as an employer due to cutbacks in payroll that result in reduced hours. Quality of service and sales have declined. As a result, employee morale seems to consistently decline and it becomes more difficult to recruit new hard-working, qualified employees."
good,"I always worked my hardest when employed here. It is fast paced, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes very easy to preform job duties. Only complaint would be lack of hours near end of quarter."
good,I have been working for Safeway a total of 5 years. After albertsons bought out safeway everything went down hill. Tons of work to do but no hours to do it. Been working in the pharmacy for almost 2 years with a skeloton crew. I am a very good worker. Very fast but efficant. But even I cannot do all the work they expect of me in a day
good,Management cuts your help and expects you to do the work of 4 men in 8 hours. Pay is good if your on the old contract. Benefits are good as well. Dont get caught up in this company.
good,"While working at Safeway, I had a few different managers. The employee's ranged from good to lazy. Things were often dealt with poorly. Lack of employee's and a lot of struggles."
good,was good used to get lot of customers before they had the supercenter so shifts flied by quick pending on location great customers never have to think about work once your shift ends
good,At Safeway you learn customer service so much. I was a courtesy clerk and I had very good customer service I was always nice to the customers and especially to the elderly
good,"10 years I worked for safeway and I don't have much to say about it. Wasn't the best job, I stayed because I was comfortable. Very stressful and demanding. Manegment only cares about less employees but same work load. Cutting hours to increase their bonuses."
good,"A very good workplace, overall. Just very under-appreciated, under-funded, and under-employed. Corporate regulations are nonsensical. they award hours to departments based on how well they're doing. If a department does not pass muster, they get less hours for their employees, leading to an even worse state. Even more worse, the manager is blamed by corporate for this new mess."
good,Come in with the mindset that it's super busy and a lot of people come in and out but just take a deep breath and smile and be positive. And just do what ever the person in charge tells u that way u don't get in trouble
good,"Hard work, fast paced, stressful my good team in my deli, my Mngr appreciates her team and treats us well.   It takes a while to work up the ladder and get hours, expect to work harder, better, and faster than others around you if you want good shifts etc.  Stronger workers will carry the load for lesser dedicated workers.  You will not be paid more based on your performance but you may get better shifts and your Manager will hopefully appreciate your dedication.  As in all jobs, you will find some favoritism, do not expect a completely equal playing field, you are dealing with human beings and people tend to do what works best for them, some Managers balance this better than others, your mileage may vary."
good,"This is a very good place to apply to when you're looking for a job, they're always hiring. They gave great hours and are willing to be open minded. They lack a lot of recognition but are spot on with telling you what you're lacking and how you can help."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company, I worked a lot of hours. Made good money everything was well organized. We all worked as a team jobs went smoothly."
good,I have become a better working at Safeway for the past couple of months.the managers are understanding when it comes to hours and personal issues and they will happily change hours if needed.
good,good company to work for the manager was great and was always there for you and the people where great as well good team happy customers as i worked in the gas bar
good,Company was very structured and provided wonderful health benefits for little required hours. They wouldn't always spend as much time training as should have been.
good,"My immediate supervisor (at Starbucks, Yakima) lacked many ""management"" skills which usually made for a difficult work environment for myself and my coworkers."
good,My first job after high school and I enjoyed the opportunities for advancement. The cons were obvious as it is a retail job and hours were less than optimal.
good,"Working at a grocery store is one of those jobs you do to gain retail experience. The typical work day isn't difficult. For most, it's either bagging groceries or standing at a checkstand for 8 hours. You learn about the ins and outs of the business. Made me a better shopper for one thing. Helped me look for sales and get info from other parts of the price tag you'd normally never look at. Management depends on the store. Sometimes you get good managers who are willing to work with you and help you. Other times, you get managers that don't care and just want to get paid and go home. I've been somewhat fortunate to have good managers of the most part. They like to promote from within. A promotion typically means a department change or to Front End Supervisor. No significant pay raise to go from Checker to Supervisor. Raises are given by how many hours you work. For example, working 1,000 hours is roughly a .20-.30 cent raise. Front End typically tops out at $5 more than an outside department. Again, it's your typical ""get into the working world"" or ""get work experience"" job."
good,The job payed well for a starter. I gave it the rating i gave simply because it was an ok job. It's a good starter job for anyone. I recommend it for primarily high school.
good,"Good environment, fast paced and never a dull moment.Really enjoyed meeting new customers each day. Staff and Managers are always respectful and willing to work with you on problems."
good,"Proper training was provided, there is an opportunity for advancement. Working at the correct store would offered further advancement and compensation for work provided."
good,Dealt with customers from when I clock in until I clock out. Learned how to keep a positive attitude and a great deal of patience. Didn't really get raises from the time I was there. Work schedule was great. Got the hours I wanted. Overall meet some great people and decent full time job.
good,everu one is respectable i enjioyed it a lot. I learnt time management very diverse people of various cultures. Lifting and late night. The coupons for emploess.
good,"Some stores are worse than others but in my experience, this company doesn't really value their employees. Their management staff doesn't lead their employees properly leading to a dysfunctional team. This job taught me that not every employer work alongside their employees and that you can spend all your time working your butt off but they will still only see the fact that you showed up 1 minute late that one time."
good,"Working here is fun because of the people around you. Most of the people in the workplace, whether they directly work with you or indirectly, want to see you be happy and succeed. Everyone works together as a unit and if one slips up, everyone usually bands together to pick up the slack. Sometimes, customer interactions can bring out bad emotions in you such as becoming mad, sad etc. The work, although easy, it is very tedious. Good place to work if you are just getting into the job market and don't have prior experience, but the people that have been there for many years take it to a different level altogether."
good,"It's pretty much what you might expect of working any register job. There's room for advancement with the individuals who are charismatic and run the extra mile to please their boss. There's also room for job training in the other departments for individuals who are bold enough to ask the other managers for a chance at training. "
good,"I was closing PIC for many years. I learned many customer service skills, also learned ordering ,cash handling. I had good managers and bad. Over all the work place was good in the smaller stores. When I transferred to the Las Vegas store it was much different. The employees there were not friendly nor helpful. The most enjoyable part of Safeway was leaving"
good,"Highly active environment. You can learn a lot of useful skills such as setting goals, productive thinking, and assertive communication. Management promotes a lot from within."
good,I enjoyed learning management skills and my mutli- tasking. It was a great learning experience and I refer this job to people who want to build their resume
good,Employers who are understanding and are willing to work around schools schedule.  I learned how to have good customer service and that patience is key in retail.
good,"Job was fast paced and a high turnover of staff throughout the day. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of me serving customers 90% of the time that I am on the clock. I slice meat and cheese, make production, prep for the next. If I'm lucky I get to work on the register sometimes which helps my customer service skills. Learning how to deal with different people and their personalities, with a smile on your face is an important skill to have. I also work in other departments of Safeway not only the deli. I choose to expand my knowledge to benefit Safeway because an employee may call out or not show, then I will be available to work or help customers. I've learned to manage my time because customers want to be in and out so I try to work a fast pace. The workplace culture is pretty friendly and very homey since the Safeway I work at is small. There is no hard part about my job because after a year you're pretty used to working. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers."
good,It takes a lot for Safeway to look so good all the time and that is thanks to the hardworking employees. It is very easy to move up if you show effort and determination it pays off.
good,"Better than a lot of retail outlets.  The corporate culture is still there, but advancements and promotions are available.  They also give adequate raises and tend to reward you with more hours and such."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of checking emails, greeting staff members, checking inventory, writing and submitting orders, stocking shelves, organizing back rooms, breaking down freight and setting up the night crew for success. At the end of the day, I would check e-mails again, make sure the shelves were fully stocked for the evening and check in with all staff present. I learned a lot about the grocery retail business. I learned how to run a perishable department and,  run it well. I learned to work quickly and deal with last minute problems. I learned how to lead a team of 20 people. The management was at times very good, and at times bad. The hardest part of my job was learning to run a department, that I had never worked in before, with only 5 days of training. The best part of my job was seeing morale improve and turn over rate decrease, in what is considered to be the most difficult department in the store."
good,"Working at the deli in safeway, is alot of work. It's good because u stay busy and time flys.Management isn't the best, but you get full time hours and can even transfer to another dept in the store."
good,over all an Okay place to work work schedule difficult at times the company is very family oriented and hard working coworkers were very friendly and helpful there were always holiday parties for employees
good,I have worked for Safeway for 6 years and it's time to find something. Something that I can be happy doing. Its not a stable job to keep and everything is that same at times.
good,Met a lot of nice people and made descent wages at the time I was there. Full benefits and flexible schedules. Helped me to get experience running a cash register and customer service.
good,"Your schedule is ready for about 3 weeks ahead so that was a good point. "
good,"work was alright and the co-workers were nice, but management was sub-par. it's a great place to work if you like being yelled at by customers for stuff that you had no control over."
good,Very flexible scheduling with great friendly people. Very strange management with weird company policies to boot. Overall it is a very good first job.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to clock in, and first thing I do is make sure everything has been done for the current shift I am working. I learned that being quick and effective is one of the best ways to get your job done and continue to help customers in a timely fashion. I love management and definitely thought that I had some of the best managers the company has had since I first started working at Safeway. My co workers were great, they helped me achieve a lot of goals that I set for myself within the company such as: being recognized as a great up seller, they pushed me to quicker and the job that needed to get done, and also had time to learn a little bit about them and their lives as well. I cant really think of a time where the job was hard but theres times when it can be time consuming and you get wrapped up in something that needs to get done while you have customers waiting on you to be serviced. The most enjoyable part of the job to me is being able to talk with the customers. I love being able to make someones day, and treating them like they are part of our family is what I like to do."
good,"Working at Safeway Distribution Center."
good,"I worked by myself in the floral department, and was able to create a lot of my own arrangements, as well as follow instructions per stores guidelines. Management wasn't great.  Didn't follow through my my concerns to them.  Hours were okay."
good,"Bought by a competitor many changes happening in the company,  More sales oriented then customer employee focus.  Will see many changes over the next year."
good,This company has been nothing but hard to adjust to. They had us hire all these people then fired them a month or two opening. Theres no room for advancement right now.
good,The work hours tend to vary from each week. i gained a lot of experience with customers and customer service. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with your questions.
good,"A typical day as a Vons  employee consisted of standing in the cash register checking out customers. Vons was a very busy produce store therefore I spent a lot of hours at the cash register which is were i learned most of my cash handling skills. When I wasn't on the cash register I was making sure the store was organized and products  were they should be. I managed to memorized where everything was in the store and guide customers to what they were looking for. Management was short on staff so they would always be busy and my co-workers were great. Everyone seem to get along in every different department. The hardest part of the job was having to switch different positions during the job when it was busy. I would go from working in the cash register to being a clerk and working in the bakery, it was very hectic and my work was not really appreciated. The most enjoyable time was helping our customers and recommending them products that they might like."
good,"A typical day for a courtesy clerk looks like:"
good,"Working at Safeway Corp has always been challenging but pleasant.  I start my day by going through my emails and prioritizing my daily agenda. "
good,"I stocked shelves but the customer always came first. If they needed anything, yes was the required answer. You cant control who else gets hired or is moved into your store so you have to take the good and the bad."
good,"What I've learned from working under Safeway(Vons) was about working as a team, working as a Courtesy Clerk taught me the importance of efficiency and quality of service that is required of the brand they want to have. "
good,"Many opportunities for advancement in this company. Schedule and hours vary in most positions influencing each weeks paycheck. Hardest part of working for the company is the unpredictable weekley schedule. Big learning experience. A hard working dedicated person will gain a lot of experience and is a great stepping stone for career growth. This company has taught me orginizational, accounting, and customer service skills that will help in most career paths."
good,"Great management , Helpful, Friendly,good balance of work and home life . Some diffuculty dealing with rude customers."
good,"My typical work day at Safeway consists of breaking down pallets of fresh and frozen products, maintaining  item tracking codes in order to track the bills of the day for Sales and Purchases (S&P), and displaying highly valued cases of the freshest products in order to meet the customers everyday needs. I have been trained in all departments of Safeway and know the products and/or items that will bring in profits to the store. My management team at the Fairwood Bowie Safeway location taught me great leadership and team work skills. I've developed great customer service and team player skills along with the means of running a business while working with the management and co-workers of Safeway. The hardest part of the job was learning new skills. I add more work in order of achieving the goal of becoming more proficient with a skill. The most enjoyable part while working for Safeway is the team work it gave the employees a great and warm environment each day we came to work."
good,I am thankful to be part of a team that is passionate about our department goals. I have learned many things in my career at Safeway that helped me grow into the professional employee I am today. We have a successful and amazing team who's creativity has set new trends year over year.
good,"As a book keeper my job was to balance tills, help customers with their issues or questions, I would answer calls that were being made, and finally be there for the management.  The management would rely greatly on the book keeper for support in running the store."
good,"If your a hard worker that shows up to work on time and ready to do your days of work and go a little up and above you will be able to promote into a variety of departments. Management is okay. Customers can be either nice or mean depending on how you approach each customer. ""Superior Customer Service"" is a very controversal guideline where it makes you sound repetive and lack of care towards customer since you repeat the same phrases to each customer that you come into contact and some customers might mistake your friendlyness."
good,Working at Safeway taught the importance of customer service no matter how small a matter it seemed to be. The management here was excellent. The hardest part of the job was the random scheduling. The most enjoyable part of this position was interacting with the customers.
good,"Always different, sometimes understaffed causing customers to become angry. Good place to advance."
good,"A typical day at work in the bakery started quite early, I learned a lot more about professional baking; especially in how to use the equipment. This was very informative and pretty fun. My department manager was excellent! My co-workers were enjoyable to work with as they kept up a lively and funny banter. We were all able to join in or listen as we work; this is one of the best parts of life and jobs; is the people you meet. The hardest part of the job for me was to start so early in the morning. This meant your day actually started at least a minimum of an hour before you actually start work."
good,"As a manger you are expected to work 10-12 hour day. the job is based off meeting goals, if goal are not meet you can be terminated or reduce to a lower position."
good,"This job gave me a great sense of accomplishment as I was able to experience so many different job duties through out the time that I put in with this company. I was able to learn how to manage a small business as I worked as a dept. head in their deli. I was required to take a state exam and passed as a Certified Food Handler. I learned to maintain my dept at a 50% gross level, which was simply keeping my cost at half of my sales. I became extremely product knowledgeable and was able fill customer needs with suggestive sales. As a Journeyman checker, I learned how to stalk and fill shelves according to schematic and to build displays with eye appeal which would promote spontaneous sales. I learned the importance of being a team player and to always keep a positive and friendly attitude no matter what I might be personally feeling. When you are working with the public it is like you are on stage, the company is counting on your performance to give their customers an understanding that your goal is to please. This was probably the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor, being on your knees to stalk, breaking down pallets trying to locate the product from your order and then hearing them call your name to run and go help check. I did have an opportunity to work with many different managers and was able to learn something different from each one."
good,"This position could be challenging at times because it was always extremely busy. Ironically, the locals seemed  to patronize this establishment more frequently then the tourists. This was a beneficial learning experience however."
good,stable job they will never fire you unless you do something really bad. Managment sucks and are rude sometimes. Always make you do extra work and the pay was very low.
good,"Safeway has a good work environment, energetic, active job that teaches you many skills. Skills such as time management, critical thinking, customer service experience, team work, and invoice reading. A day at  work consists of moving freight, stocking shelves, assisting customers, communicating with management about product and day to day operations. Co-workers will help assist you with freight or merchandise, make friendly conversation with you and customers. The hardest part of the job would be trying to meet the demands of the store, management, and customers in a shift"
good,"dealing with customers and their requests, co workers were a good team and they were friendly"
good,New experience to be part of a 28 Buyer department. Purchasing at Canada Safeway in Calgary buys all groceries and general merchandise for more than 250 Canada Safeway supermarkets canada-wide
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed this job. I went from cashier to bookkeeper to person in charge in a ten month period. I had all kinds of responsibilities ranging from greeting customers to customer complaints to money management of entire store to being ""the boss"" when being the only PIC on duty. Everyone was friendly whom I worked with and all seemed to appreciate their job and my management skills. The hardest part of this job was lifting more than my body weight at times and needing help. The most enjoyable was meeting new people and learning a wide range of skills."
good,"A typical day at work is usually anywhere from 10-12 hours/day. In the two years I have been at this job, I have been able to sharpen and hone my managerial and interpersonal communication skills in order to complete multiple tasks at once while still finding time to maintain a personal life. "
good,"typically i would get there and check the washrooms and do a sweep log (i look though all the isles and make sure all clean) then go about checking the carts and baskets, seeing if people need a hand and just repeat that."
good,"A typical day at work is in the produce department. Mainly my task are to maintain the tables while attending to costumers. All the while keeping the backroom clean and clear for the new load. Another one of my duties is to help keep the lines down when check-out lines are overflowing. "
good,it was always a very social like environment. everyday your learning something new
good,"Shift started at 10pm to 7am in the morning "
good,Great benefits. Poor staffing. Uncomfortable environment to work in.
good,"Working for Safeway is a joy because of the friendly staff and customers.  The over-all climax of working at Safeway was experiencing the care from everyday customers out-side of Safeway, when I was off-duty."
good,"A typical day at work started with our team getting right to work. "
good,"very busy in the Deli Dept,"
good,"Off load pallets, stock my department.sign all merchandise,customer service,make floral arrangements for occasions and every day use.Co-workers were helpful and nice.I most enjoyed working with the flowers.The hardest part was off loading the pallets."
good,"I was a bakery clerk so my day consisted of baking cookies and other food items, stocking shelves, stocking bread, ordering bread and scanning any expired item. I also worked as a file maintenance clerk and my duties were to print out the price tags and when prices changed change the tags."
good,Part time job helping people with whatever they needed. ie. finding certain items in-store and processing product refunds and recycled bottle returns.
good,"A good Company to work for with good benefits, however it's employee requirements on extreme customer service seemed to cause a lot of tension through out the store at the time when I was working there. It seems to have lightened up a bit and is my favorite place to buy my groceries. I would work for them again if given the chance."
good,very busy place to work and strong customer skills necessary all time .
good,Worked with really great people at each facility I have had a chance to work at. Hardest part of the job is the amount of change that takes place on a daily basis.
good,"working as a courtesy clerk you had to be quick on your feet, able to help customers if they had too many groceries or help the elderly in and out the store, clean up any spills that you see"
good,"Personally, I love Safeway. i have worked there for 14 years and overall the management has treated me well. Sometimes however, a person can get trapped in a particular place because they are very good at what they do. Co-workers seem to come and go fairly easy with a low end start up pay. Veterans are few but hold the ship in place. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fresh smell of food and the new and old customers I see each day. The customers make me feel like family and visa versa. If I had to label one aspect of the job hardest or taxing it would be the crazy amount of paperwork on seemingly wasteful time consuming stuff. The customer must always be our number #1 objective and if paperwork gets in the way of that, the paperwork needs to be slimmed down."
good,It was my first job. I don't really remember much after all these years.
good,It was a fast pace clean environment help to build customer service skills as well as time management skills. easiest part was making coffee the hardest walking in the freezer.
good,"The company is not receptive to ""out of the box"" thinking. Safeway does not offer enough training programs to help employees get promoted. It's not what you know at the company it's who you know, or who are you related to."
good,Fun job though the union is mandatory and union dues are mandatory as well.
good,At Safeway their is a lot to do from bagging grocers to night stocking. their are always people to help. During toe Holiday season it get crazy but don't worry .
good,Safeway was my income for a long time and it helped take care of my family. Many friends were made with this company who I still communicate with in some way.
good,I loved my job at Safeway regular customers and awesome coworkers I'm still friends with to this day. It's a fun fast paced work environment with great people.
good,"Worked typically 10+ hrs. a day. Loved my job until new managenent. I felt i was head hunted until they let me go.i would set all weekly displays on tuesday. I would process payroll, time and attendance."
good,"a typical day at safe way sucks boring and a terrible job,i learned how to stock and cashier and do dairy ,management was not to bad the boss is a cool guy , the employees were not the friendliest  people."
good,"I do not agree on the new wage scale, but a great company for benefits if you qualify. Health and safety is a priority. Company often offers first aid courses."
good,"Friendly coworkers and management. Opportunity to cross-train to other departments and lots of opportunity for advancement."
good,I worked briefly at a Safeway in Ft. Collins starting off as a courtesy clerk.  My manager was wonderful and was working with me to get into the bakery department but I had to move back to Colorado.  I did not work for Safeway again because of other employment.
good,"This was a safety-first work place while being able to satisfy customer needs quickly and efficiently. The inconsistent work schedule can be a challenge at times, but the weekly pay and union benefits make up for any inconveniences. The overa;; health/retirement benefits are an added security."
good,"getting to the store, checking to make sure the drivers are ready to start their routes. New management for the area not up to par with the operation of the .com area. getting the stores to have the orders ready for the drivers. meeting new people."
good,"Was one place I worked but really didn't mind for it. Work days were eventful and long."
good,In this type of job team work is important. If you don't have a good team you will not succeed and the store will suffer. This a very labor intensive job you need to be strong and healthy and able to lift and carry heavy loads. be ready to work hard and over your scheduled hours if needed until the job is done. Be prepaired for extra hours hours during the holidays due to extreme amount of business.
good,Upon starting there was a great place to work but our store manager left and a new one was hired. at this point is when the moral of the store started to fail
good,The company overall is great to work for... individuals are a different story. As long as your story does not get sold... all is good. And transferring from one store to another should be easier.
good,"Good place to work, work schedule was extremely flexible and allowed me the time to be at home with family when needed or be their transportation and when wife was ill."
good,"I enjoyed working at Safeway and we were all blindsided by the sale of the company to Publix. The benefits were great with full medical and dental coverage, life insure, short term disability insurance and 401 K."
good,I been working with retail since I was 16 and I have a great experience working with people and helping them as well and putting a smile on their faces with great customer service and been getting alone with everyone I work with in the pass years I have work with this company and with management as well and the workplace culture is great working with good employees and treating me with respect
good,"the floral department is not valued enough to pay its employees more than the average produce clerk. If you'd like to sell your soul to the check stands or carnage department to earn a livable wage, than you can. I've fallen in love with floral and I refuse to leave the department and not the company."
good,"I work in the Starbucks kiosk, I love my coworkers, my manager, and my customers. However, I feel underpaid for my position, I get less then one of my regular baristas who started working after me. Other than that, its an easy job, a little fast paced and sometimes stressful, but easy."
good,"My coworkers were cooperative yet serious about their job, it was a comfortable setting. My work area was very spacious. My team that I worked with kept a tight ship at all times."
good,Staff are some of the best I have worked with. Days go by very quickly as the pharmacy is always really busy. Some difficult customers as in any pharmacy.
good,"The job became extremely stressful as a lead or manager. You are not given the help you need to accomplish the tasks that need to be done. For many managers it was a bit defeating. I worked with great people, and my team was awesome."
good,I made really good money working for Safeway.The job was very stressful and very demanding.Lots of overtime and lots of paid vacations.It is a union job and all jobs go by seinority.
good,"It was good but it wasnt a good place for full time. The co-workers are great but the manager are really not there. They expect you to do things without telling you and the training is very poor, if you even get any."
good,"My time at Safeway was pretty awesome. I leaned skills then, that I can still apply anywhere else. Many of these lessons and info I can pass on to anyone who doesn't know. Information is so powerful. I learned how a bakery works, how to stock shelves: make them look pretty, how to use a trash compactor, how to organize flower displays. Also another skill I want to add is how to use public transit. I would have to walk about a mile and half to the bus stop, I learned the bus schedule and to plan according when to leave my house and arrive to work on time. often showed up early."
good,I got burned after 2 days on the job. No one acknowledged it. I was only there for 2 weeks. It just wasn't a good fit for me at all.  I was in the deli and I don't like it
good,"It was nice working at safeway , everyone was very friendly and positive. At the deli was good experiencing all the people you get to meet and get to make new friendships."
good,"The management there could be way better.  They don't care about their employees, they don't pay fairly, and they are rude to customers.  I would not recommend this job to anybody."
good,"the job is a pretty good job especially for students, the pay is on the low side though.  Working in the meat department there is a fairly high degree of autonomy. There can sometimes be an overwhelming amount of work to do but topically only on the holidays.The typical work day is not very difficult."
good,I wish to decline my opinion on this company it tens to have a hostel type work environment work place on the top seems to run smooth then you look in the departments
good,This company was excellent to work for when I had small children and worked part time. There was flexibility in changing schedules as long as you were still accomplishing the your job in  the required time frame. The system changes in time requirements for distress and orders did not compute the direct customer service that may have been involved at any given time. In later years it was a challenge to achieve the job goals that were required. For many years prior to this I felt my job was an excellent example of part-time employment.
good,"Curetsy Clerk position is a base position that requires a lot of standing and basically waiting at all the time. I had learned how to bad, and pack groceries. Management was really nice, and was willing to understand your needs. It is small group of people that work side by side. The hardest part of the job is that you have to be patient, when it is super slow. The most enjoyable part of the job is a pay check lol."
good,"I have learned a lot from working  here . i have learned how to deal with more people at once, became a very social person. The hard part about being there was the management was not at its best. We were very low on staff and our front end managers would no call no show. It was good that it fit around my school schedule and was a weekly pay."
good,"The overall work requirements are easy to learn. The drinks are easy to learn, the customers more often than not a pretty chill and relaxed with exceptions of course. Being trained in the routines and recipes is never an issue considering that Starbucks outlines and has a standard for nearly every little thing that goes on in all store operations. Unfotunately, due to the fact that the location is a licensed store you often have to defer to store managers who are not familiar with starbucks store operations, schedules are unpredictable, you are often pressured to work on your own during busy store hours, understaffing has always been an ongoing issue and hour cuts are frequent. It's a good place to work if your looking for benefits as it is linked to the union and the work environment with other people besides management is overall good."
good,"I have been employed with Safeway for 13 year's, it is a good company to work for the expectation's of the company are not out of reach as far as daily tasks."
good,"If you've learned all you need to learn and are ready for the mundane, this is your place. If you're looking to learn new methods, technologies, etc, this is NOT your stopping point, but a bump in your road."
good,"This is a job with so much culture within the neighborhood. I am very pleased with my environment, but I am in need of better pay due to not being full time."
good,I loved working there.  I love people and getting to know all of them.  Managers were very unfair and biass at times. It is very fast pace and you must be ready for anything.
good,"As a deli clerk there is a lot of responsibilities you have, and it's not an easy job. It's quite demanding in the sense of you feel the need that you need to be there a lot, for long periods of time. On the plus side, the management is great, friendly staff, amazing work environment in genera.l"
good,"In my experience always short staffed so everyone is always really tired and busy!"
good,"greast company likeDental Assistant x-ray Certification"
good,The job has been great to me for the last 10 years. The security is what is flaky right now and no advancement options available.
good,"Customer Service is priority number one, ordering for current and upcoming ads on a daily basis, making sure the departments have their products. Enter acting with vendors on a daily basis to ensure they have there areas stocked for sales.Maintaining low inventory levels in the backroom. Making sure that the store is well stock for that days sales.Building displays on the sales floor to ensure that we don't run out of an item that is on sale for that week. Stock shelves thru out the store.  I enjoy enter acting with the employees and the customers on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is going home filling like you didn't get everything accomplished that day."
good,I enjoyed serving the customers and working with the great staff.I enjoyed preparing the food.This was a very high paced environment where we had to multitask.The hardest part was finding reliable staff.
good,"Management was Horrible"
good,"I enjoyed working at safeway, i didnt mind retreiving carts and baskets, i would have liked to do more though. I would definitely work there again"
good,"learend to read iso and blueprints"
good,"Fun place to work, always learning something new. A lot of knowledge gained in the years I worked there. Flexibility was a plus. I realised I wanted more for my life then just a retail career."
good,"I usually arrive at work about 15 minutes early to prepare for my shift which includes using the restroom putting on apron getting a drink from Starbucks and checking daily schedule. Usually I will have to re-leave someone for a break or lunch. As soon as I clock in I immediately jump into working. Helping customers, organizing my check stand from previous checker, clean work area, stocking, straightening up merchandise, counting drawer to see if I need large bills broken or extra small bills or change. Depending on what my shift I will have a break after my first 2 hours of shift per the shift schedule. I enjoy working with my co-workers and direct supervisors everyone gets along, we work hard and enjoy each other company while doing it. The hardest part of the job is standing in one stop for long periods of time. I've learned a lot while working for this company and they have taught me a lot about sales and customer service."
good,"This position was very intense but, kept me focused on my job while ensuring to keep a safe working environment, I enjoy working as a team player and making sure that the job was done right.  I also enjoyed working warehouse equipment which I was very good at doing."
good,"Love assistant managers!, but we were always short staffed which put a heavier load on the people that were working. It's a nice place to for young people to work after school but not really paying enough for me anymore. Amazing people work here, I can always have fun with my co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work is doing my job by making sure customers are finding what they are looking for and seeing whether they need help looking for a certain brand or product. I learned that this would be a good first job for a beginner who is looking for a job. This job is giving the skill to communicate with other people (strangers). This is giving them the chance to not be shy to earn the respect and trustworthy relationship for the customers, to satisfy them with a ""how is your day?"" ""Thank you for coming, Have a good day!"" etc., The Management is different than expected, I would be motivated and ready to greet customers and help co-workers out. My co-workers are polite and courteous, the have a happy talk, always smiling and greeting the customers with a kind response. The hardest part about my job is trying to make a customer feel good about shopping at Safeway. The most enjoyable part is being able to meet new people."
good,Safeway is a great place if you want to progress your career as a meatcutter. However progression is slow. The work is intense and very stressful. expect to be pushed to your limits
good,"My typical day would be greeting my employees, customers and vendors. I would then start on payroll and get my schedule organized for the day ahead. I enjoyed most was my employees and customers. It was fun to get to know my regular shoppers too."
good,"I enjoyed working there and working with my co-workers, I learned a lot while there.  But this is an experience I prefer not to repeat."
good,"A typical work day, would start with clocking in then talking to you manager and hearing about any new promotions going on at work, contest..etc. Then you would go to you're till and start working most favourite part was when I was in the till and got to interact with all the different costumers that came through. Break you get to interact with you're co-workers which was nice, asking about their day knowing more about them. Everyone was friendly. Hardest part of the job would be when it is around thanksgiving and they is a lot of turkeys to lift and bag, but it wasn't so bad."
good,"Typical day at work involves walking the store in the morning talking with employees to see how their day is going and see if there are any areas that need immediate attention.  Then I do payroll, look through emails and get back on the floor to do a thorough walk.  During this walk I will address any issues that need to be taken care of, make a list of jobs to be done and talk with all of my department managers and we discuss numbers and sales strategies for the day.  I then have a game plan for the day and I will distribute the list to the proper people and then go back around to departments and work with them on merchandising and displaying product for better profit and sales.  I love this part of my day because it gives me a time to work with the employees and I'm on the floor to talk with customers."
good,"the most enjoyable job is the moment when your job is done nicely and perfectly ."
good,"As a Front-End Manager I have to"
good,"A Typical day at work consisted of making & preparing sandwiches , hot foods, deli meats & cheeses for customers. The hardest part of my job was preparing very specific sandwiches for customers if you didn't make theirs exactly how they want it a conflict would reoccur , so simply we would just ask if they would like there sandwich to be made all over again or would they prefer another employee to make it for them. The most enjoyable part of the job was again being able to communicate & interact with the customers."
good,"I loved my job at safeway but, with my husband being in the military i had to leave my job. only down fall was i hated the fact we had to pay union dues."
good,"Typical day at work when I clocked in was basically going straight to the cash register and ringing customers up. Aside from being in the register, I would occasionally get the freedom to go out and put groceries away and direct people with where they needed to go to find things. All my co-workers were always good to me because I was very friendly and easy going. The same can be said for the majority of my customers as well, but every now and then I would always get that one customer who just completely lost it with me. The hardest part of the job is definitely keeping your composure and being professional when situations like that go down. Other than that, I loved meeting new people and conversing with them about their day."
good,"Not a good fit for me, I simply did not like it and can not fairly judge."
good,There are a lot of shifts to pick up for this company.  Benefits have been decent for me.  They are tight on labor hours.
good,customers and employees are good to work with. always resonable when it comes to scheduling and hours
good,"It took too long get a raise. I would help the costumers with deli meat. I learned how to work with a team, do inventory, and be dependable. The deli manger is great, but store manager are disrespectful. Co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is getting all the production done, especially when it was busy.The most enjoyable part with the people there."
good,"this was my first job out of pharmacy school. Good people, great local pharmacy."
good,"preparing baked goods for merchandising and sale."
good,This is a job that after a while I dreaded coming to work. Management expected a lot out of you. they didn't give you much recognition for stuff you did right and always picked you apart for everything you did wrong.
good,everything was perfect until management was changed..hardest part was waking up in the morning but it gets used too..enjoyable part was making bread and baking them.
good,"I really liked working at the safeway store i was employeed at. It was super easy to get along with all the others employees, and the management team was very friendly."
good,"I currently live in concord,ca but i am able to relocate if a job in the floral dept comes up.You may contact me via phone or email.I will be in the washington area between sept 7-21st.I could schedule an interview while I am there,if need be,thanks for your time in this matter.I am un-employed at the time and i am looking for work at this time."
good,I would ring orders in at the till. I would also do file maintance once a week.
good,Friendly and relaxed at times yet it can be the opposite. Managers are either really friendly or are unbareable.
good,Generally a good place to work.  The job opportunities in the company and even in each store are so diverse.  The best thing about the job were the benefits.
good,"makes you feel like you work at home. learned how to control irate customers. co-workers like family, fun job."
good,"typical:log in, put things back, clean, bring in carts, help customers"
good,"I have learned lots at working at Safeway. When i first started at Safeway i had no experience in the bakery, im currently frying donuts and doing all of the preparation."
good,"Depending on the shift you are given, most of the time it's the same routine. As soon as you clock in you provide customer service to any customer that may need assistance. When you are in the kiosk you are listening to the customer and their needs. I also serve handcrafted beverages. I have learned to listen and anticipate the customers needs at a professional level. I learned the proper attributes to be a salesman and a barista. My coworkers were fun to be around, energetic, friendly yet professional. The hardest part of the job was maintaining leadership because everything has to be on point all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the drinks and seeing the customers satisfied with the beverage I provided them."
good,"Great place to work for the benefits, paid vacation, Medical insurance."
good,"A typical day at work involves giving customers as much service as you are capable. Lots of face time with all sorts of people. The management is so-so. The manager is consistant and is concerned with making the customers completely satisfied. The supervisors have their own interpretation of the rules and are far less professional. Many of my coworkers share the same likes and dislikes about the company, they are good with customers, and good to each other. The hardest part of the job is trying to balance customer's needs and the micromanagement by coworkers who can be very demanding of attention as well. The most enjoyable part of the job is the security, hours, and benefits."
good,Safeway you really had a lot to do but it wasn't hard work. I learned a lot of customer service and project solving skills. My co-workers were either easy to cope and get along with. Hardest part of my job was dealing with lazy co-workers and manager not knowing how to run the store. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with different customers.
good,"Working for Safeway was a line of work were you had to be able to have good time managment, knowing exactlly what to do an to have done what was expected of you to have done.What i learned while i worked for Safeway was a greater increace in my customer service an how to manage my time that much better. Most of my co-workers where very nice an helpful. Hardest thing about my job at Safeway was dealing with angry customers an trying to help them beome happier with the company. The managment at Safeway was ok, they are always dealing with unsatified customers or in confrence calls very busy people.The most enjoyable paut of my job was being able to see alot of people threw out the day."
good,management was very helpful. they are have been there in every difficulties times.
good,"Working for this company/job could lead to a career, personal growth if you take advantage of the whole entire experience. Store Managers/directors Do make a Huge difference on how the business is works."
good,"I felt like I learned the daily routine at the bakery pretty quickly, At least that's what I thought. I constantly asked them how I was doing and they never had any complaints just some everyday tips, such as smile more. When I got my first paycheck my co-workers were as confused as I was to see i was not on the schedule. I called every day for 2 or 3 days waiting to see when I should come in but the manager for my section always had an excuse. I started to get frustrated and decided to call the store manager and she told me a whole different story. She said the Bakery Manager decided my ""trial period was unsatisfactory"". I've worked at a handfull of different places for the past 5 years and not once have I heard that, let alone just been removed from the schedule without an explanation. I was never told why the manager made that decision after telling me I was doing great. The hardest part of the job was honestly stacking the bagged bread because you had to read the dates as well as put the older ones on the top which sounds easy but is genuinely hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is hard to choose because there were many. I enjoyed my co-workers, including the manager regardless of what happened. By far the very best part was honestly the smell. The kitchen always smelled of pastries and it was the best. In conclusion, I loved the experience I just wish I knew what I did wrong."
good,In my management position I had a hard time as Albertsons had just bought out Safeway.Had to comform to Albertsons way of doing things which was on a different spectrum all together.I was running the Seafood dept by myself as all clerks quit and ended up working split shifts.My dept suffered and new management wasnt willing to help or give me advice or support.
good,I learned a lot about different departments. Had some great co-workers. Wanted to stay but with stores closing there was not guaranteed job security. The customers were great and it was say to build relationships with them. Especially enjoyed being a cashier over other departments
good,Morning started by getting product out for sale. Made sure to pull all expired items off tables and cases. Log in daily temperature of all cases and freezers. Most of days were a great day at safeway.  Enjoyed customers who shopped on daily basis.
good,"good place to work with benifits package. Lots of room to advance, and tons of different positions you can work into. Schedule is posted 3 weeks in advance with is nice and they always try to give you the time off you ask for."

good,It was my first job and I was there for around a year and I loved the work. Great people and a fast paced environment. Over time there wasn't enough new things to learn.
good,It was my firs job and it was after school I really loved it it was fun and exciting to learn new stuff also love talking with other it was a pleasure working there
good,"I really did like working at Safeway. Yeah sure on occasion when the ""big-wigs"" would come through for a store walk everyone was on edge but would collaborate together and make the store look fantastic. The customers are typically regulars so you gain a great rapport with them. Not to mention the deals they had in the meat department on ribeye steaks!!"
good,"It was tiring, i only learned boxing baked things, making vases,taking care of flowers, making bouquets, the manager was bad, the culture was good, heavy lifting, too big stores and had to mop by hands, discounts on things,"
good,"I found my coworkers  encouraging, and  I enjoyed the time that they took out of there day to teach me the tricks of the trade.  I take pride in anything I do, and a worm smile can go a long way."
good,"Advancement opportunities are wonderful. However, there isn't a set schedule so your hours and scheduled days may lack consistancy. Paid vacations and wonderful benefits."
good,Working here to get through it you just have to keep to your self and don't listen to what other workers have to say . Supervisors are ok to work with union is good
good,Bakery was being able to get everything packaged and presented for customers.  Deli was making sure the food was hot and customers were helped in a timely manner.
good,"A typical day at work is driving truck in the state of Arizona delivering Safeway product to Safeway stores. I get to work with different people. Safeway's equipment is in top shape, making my job easier. Management is very easy to work for as long as you come to work, and do your job. The hardest part of my job at Safeway is driving in northern Arizona in the winter."
good,"Co-workers are great, benefits are decent and they will work around a school schedule.. But the management team is garbage."
good,"I've only experienced their bakery department; however, I did get to interract with the other people in different departments during breaks."
good,"I loved working for Safeway, a lot of good people,good friends, great memories.It was great for 16 years than Safeway merged with another company,things changed drastically."
good,Safeway division at one point was an amazing place to work.  Once Albertsons took over everyone was replace and the quality of work was not there any longer.   Hoping the stores are not affected by it.
good,"It was my first official day to day job, So I went in confident and thought I knew it all. As the days went by my flaws started to out weigh my strong work habits, I used to be late 3 times out the week and i'm really not a socialist so my boss was getting on me about that and there were few butt holes inside the bakery so it was an eerie feeling sometimes. But there were good and bad days on the job but "
good,Was my first job and it kept me very busy. That job taught me how to deal with all types of people . I got to work with some very nice people.
good,"Customer service first, Making sure all orders are correctly made and dates are correct, run donations to charity. The hardest part of my job would have to be closing when its time to close and you still have people coming in and your not allowed to work overtime"
good,"Fun place to work, Learned how to work the til and cash out, My co-workers were always helpful and very easy going to work with. The hardest part about working this job was dealing with rude customers that were inpatient. The best part about this job would be seeing happy smiling people come in and make my day the best.having lunch in the lunch room was always a fun moment everyone made everyone feel welcome."
good,"A typical day at Safeway is very busy dealing with customers, money handling, and other tasks assigned. Co-workers was very diverse and easy to get along with. Management needs to be more open to employees to get more production from employees. I learned how to process Western Union transactions. The hard part of the job was balancing cash in the vault. The mos enjoyable part of the job is meeting a lot of customers and serving them to the best of my ability that I find very rewarding."
good,"Bagging groceries for customers, helping customers find what they needed, collecting carts from outside, dumping garbages and cleaning up any spills that created an unsafe enviorment. I learned how to interact with people who I don't really know by creating a light conversation with them. I also learned what it was like to work in general with this postition being my very first job. Working with my co-workers in my department for the most part was enjoyable and the managment I felt was overall good but, needed some work as anything and everyone does. The hardest part of my job was having to pick up the slack of others because, no matter what the person did before me I was still obligated to do my job even if I had to work 10x harder in order to cover them. The most enjoyable part about the job was being able to help the people who came into the store and make their expericence the best i could so they would want to return."
good,"I have the courage to handle customers and get the job done. I have learned customer service is a big part in my job accurate inventory, schedule writing, paperwork, knowing how much sales I bring in and know how much I can spend and still make money for the company, team player with other departments when they need help. I get on  Conference calls great communication skills with store manager and my boss (merchandiser) keep him informed on everything and any problems I may run into. Communication is a big part in my job I text, call or email my corporate boss.The hardest part of the job it getting everything done and giving outstanding customer service all at the same time and the best part going home knowing I got the job done and enjoy life, my work will always be there the next day."
good,"The work is usually simple in any department, the pay scale is slow so be aware and the job stays at work when you leave"
good,"I have learned how to tend to customers needs as well as cope with issues from customers such as not making a cake order or adjusting a decoration. In the bakery after a certain time I am completely by myself until closing. The hardest part is being able to take phone orders, tend to customers, package and distribute product as well as baking evening product."
good,"Taking orders for special orders, Decorating cakes, baking cookies, cakes, and bread. Cleaning service deli, cooking food and cutting meat. Working directly with customers and customer service desk"
good,A good environment to begin working. It was my first job in high school and it taught me much about the working world.
good,"Checking was fun but when I became a Supervisor the oprions were great. I had so many more options to do things than just stand at the register, even though it was fun dealing with all the customers."
good,most of the ttime i was cleaning unfortunately. management is somewhat ok. co-workers are nice.
good,Fun loving co-worker at this location. You get a since of family once you get to know some of them. I have made great friends here. Hard working store. Busy so the time goes by fast.
good,"There is one coworker in the deli, she makes me feel bad about everything I do. Other than that everyone is nice, the hours are good and I learn a lot"
good,"Safeway offers room for growth, whether it be a promotion from a Courtesy Clerk to a Cashier and/or Management! Safeway is all about above and beyond customer service."
good,"Safeway is a pretty decent job.  It offers good benefits such as vacation, paid holidays and good insurance.  They do promote from within so there is opportunity to work your way up."
good,Assisting customers as well as guiding employees to perform tasks to better assist the front end. I learned how to write a schedule. The job is relaxing and easy going as long as you do the work that is assigned.
good,really good environment good teammenship the management is really helpful and give good advice the other people who work there are very nice and when you first start they are there to help
good,"A typical day I had at work was when we had a big rush at the store and it was less workers. I learned at safeway you have to have patience , but through it all I enjoyed working there ."
good,"typical cashier job and had a lot of things that could go wrong from customers an dthe management. have to keep an eye out for the scammers who try pulling a fast one on ya,"
good,"Some days were slow, sometimes it was busy. To start, getting carts was the first thing on my list. And bagging groceries. I learned how to work as a team with my other co-workers. The culture was friendly, nurturing, customers were easy to get along with. The hardest part was gathering carts, I loved the people that I worked with. That is what I enjoyed the most."
good,I loved working at Safeway the people were great they are warm and very understanding. I was the key holder for ten registers and six departments. I also  handled payroll check cashing as well as western union sending and recaving  money. The manager however was the bad seed in the bunch and it made very hard to be there. I had to put my two weeks in due to the fact that he was the only one that treated me unfair.
good,Safeway is a great company for pay and benefits. However the management there isn't to great. They tend to not help get you to where you need to be in order to be a productive member of the team and if you end up failing they'll fire you at the drop of a dime.

good,"I enjoyed this job because it taught me a lot of self discipline, and although it was extremely demanding physically it was always enjoyable. I had a great manager and the community over all was more like a little family. It was not just a job with strangers but more like a family working together. I did have a bit of a hard routine because my day typically started at 1 am, and I would get off of work at about 9:30 in which time i typically had to go to class at the university I attended. Needless to say full time as both employee and student did at times seem as though it would be a never ending power struggle between pushing through and giving up but I pushed through and it made me a very disciplined and strong individual."
good,I learned a lot working at Safeway. Over the years I met a lot of good people. I was trained by some of the best out there.

good,I liked working at Safeway but the advancement was non existent.
good,"safeway is a great place to work, but in my place in deli department was kind of stressful, because of my coworker that almost all of them is not helping each other to get the work done, but the management is pretty good. have a higher salary and every sunday I get an extra a dollar per hour."

good,Everything was fine with working with Safeway .  There where some nice co works there that I meet while working in safeway. I enjoyed working there...
good,A typical day at Safeway was ringing up items all day. I learned about many food products. My manager there was really flexible and understanding. The hardest part of the job was learning all the codes for the produce. The easiest was scanning the items. The environment was really easy-going.
good,"I like this place, just wish they would crack down on the theft, poor management, only because there is a lack of hours due to the theft....someone needs to come in there and set these people straight, but you can't do that because this is a liberal state and you wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelings...its ridiculous if you ask me. I work hard and pay upwards of 30% in taxes...my work ethic is unparalleled.  Time to move to a red state."
good,"This is by far the best job I have ever had. I love all of my customers, its nice having familiar faces every time I work. I love coffee and being a barista with a passion."
good,Get along well with the public.  All the cleaning supplies that were needed were always available.  Management always willing to enplane job and policy.
good,"a typical day at work was running shift doing orders, banking, rosters, serving customers, cleaning every day stuff. i enjoyed working with my staff and are still friends with some today. the hardest part of my job was leaving as i really enjoyed working at woolsworth"
good,"Safeway is a great job for high school kids who are seeking a part time job. It is easy to climb the career ladder, although difficult to make any money at Safeway... unless you're upper management making salary. I was personally there for 3 years only making $12.75 as a supervisor and my store's ISR. I had the opportunity to join the RLD (ASM training program) for my district. Due to my spouse relocating, I had decline this opportunity."
good,As a cashier at Safeway my typical work day was an 8 hour shift with two -15 minute breaks and 1 -30 minute lunch break. I learned how to talk respectively to customers and how to sucessfully manage  the cash register. I also learned the responsibility of money transactions. My co-workers were all pleasant and helped me throughout my training. The hardest part of my job was memorizing the produce codes in Safeway. The most enjoyable part of my job was doing my best to make the customers experience enjoyable and stress free.
good,i have worked here for 8 years learned how to work and manage different departments great co workers we always work as a team unloading the pallets full of product heavy lifting working with customers

good,I am currently a Produce Clerk and a typical day at work includes starting at 5am in the morning and working my department.  I work on setting up the front table with fruits and vegetables.  That is pretty much all I do besides of course helping customers and making them feel welcome while shopping at Safeway.  
good,i would tell people about safeway they work with your hours and they are flexible also the staff that work at safeway is like a family and they included everybody when they do things outside of work
good,"Courtery Clerk Sweep and clean bathrooms,desks,and trash out, Also Put food into stocks, dispatcher groceries and sort groceries and push carts into store"
good,"Worked during only day shift but rotated around the different warehouses (grocery, produce, dairy, etc...)"
good,Safeway was kind of a stressful job for me I’m not going to put it all the way down but it just wasn’t right for me. Others might enjoy working there and you can move up too if your 18 up it might be a little better for you.
good,"My days while working for Safeway were overall incredibly busy. I immediately upon hire began learning managerial skills as well as customer service skills. I learned how to lead as well as learn at the same time. The hardest part of the job was at times the pressure and responsibility of the job itself as well as having to adapt to such a fast paced working environment while being trained. Because of this oppurtunity however, i developed self worth like never before and was able to begin career building skills and opportunities for the future."
good,Sanitation and maintenance Forklift operator Damage product is collect Collect Pilot Cutting a plastic Collects cardboard Mopping floor Wishing by a machine in the floor
good,"safeway was my first job out of pharmacy school. i had worked for safeway part time while going to pharmacy school, so was great they started opening pharmacies when i was finishing up. but they weren't progressive when needing to be. they were very late to the table getting computers, so i left."
good,excellent work place loving place easy to make friends. good hours
good,Management was very supportive and caring. Willing to help with anything. Flexible schedules.
good,I was working at safeway for 2 years and I had to    re -locate for personal reasons. If I could stay at safeway I would go back as part time. I loved my job.
good,"I'm very angry having started at a well established corporation assuming I finally got it made to only find out that I have to pay union dues to keep a job that can't or won't even give me enough to live on. "
good,I was usually running around with my head cut off cause they didn't ever have enough people to do all the things that needed to be done.
good,"good starting job for a person going into the workforce, not an area that you want to make as a career. This is a fun place to work at but the management made it a difficult place to work at."
good,"they are a great company but i will not work there again. The store i worked at; the management was horrible and did not communicate with their staff, there was so many miscommunications that could have been avoided if they would have just sat down and listened to what people had to say."
good,"Learned to look over Produce and restock Produce. Easy job all the way around. Pretty quiet place to work really didn't not need a manager to restock. Help customers to find what they were looking for and then moved on with job,"
good,"Work here is good you slack but when there’s work you need to work! Heavy material!! You worked a lot of hrs, the only bad thing it’s you don’t get paid holidays,vacation!"
good,Safeway is an alright place to work if you enjoy the freedom of choosing when your breaks are and they offer a decent work life balance as long as you provide adequate notice.
good,"Safeway is a good company to work for. They do employee young adults who haven't learned how to treat their fellow workers. There was an air of favoritism, and how some employees were treated by management."
good,It was a very educational job. I learnt a lot at this job. Very friendly staff. Management was good. Busy work place. Got to be able to work under pessure
good,"I worked as a courtesy clerk. There was very little room for growth, while expected to work in other departments and cover shifts and getting minimum wage. Management was poor. Lack of communication between upper and lower management."
good,"Not much to say here. This job was basic, underpaid and dangerous. Customer service desk was always interesting! But the lack of pay and the job requirements did not match."
good,I would stock shelves at night and operate a cash register as well checking out customers with their purchase that they have made get rid of cardboard and face the store so it would look nice when we reopen the store at 6am
good,"I learnt to serve customers, fallow orders, work a till and be efficient under pressure."
good,"At first they offer you areas where you can move up but it never goes anywhere. If you ask any questions you will be manage and told ""we will get back to you."" Don't get me wrong if you are young and in school this is a great job. It will teach the points of life and what goes on. But if you are an adult trying to make a living don't work at Safeway."
good,"I have seen that in grocery stores, the people who are usually happy with their jobs are the cashiers, customer service and Starbucks.  There are other departments to work in too, but beware the deli! Once you're in you'll never get out!"
good,"The management was unfair and not clear on guidelines and rules. Also, many were unfairly favored in their hours they received. No benefits until over a year of working."
good,"Overall it's a great company that loves their customers and does their best to constantly improve. Individual locations need work though. I worked at two different states, one store was fantastic, the other had horrible management and did not treat employees well."
good,"A typical day for me was coming in and getting started on making drinks and/or taking orders at the register. If there was cleaning tasks to get done we would get started on them as it became less busy between rushes. i think the hardest part of the job is just keeping up with drinks during a rush. you need to be able to multitask with making at least two drinks at a time and if you mess one up, it can throw you off and you can behind. the management was alright. sometimes a couple of people wouldn't get the required amount of hours for their week scheduled. personally the most enjoyable part of the job was making drinks during rushes. it seems hard but it was my favorite part."
good,"Typical work day was different everyday. I loved working on something new in every department. I learned a lot about departments, closing opening them. The culture of the workplace was fun and exciting. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with each department, but it was always fun to meet new people."
good,"not a good job..pay stinks,advancement stinks,union is no good..only take this job if you have another"
good,"just helping out customers, making coffee getting and getting pastries for my customer."
good,some of the employes wear grate to work with management was not all that grate promised 40 hours a week get cut to 35-27 hours a week seen a lot of favortisem
good,"Unfortunately Safeway is closed. "
good,The pay isn't worth the irregular schedule but it is unionized! You end up finishing the last shift work because they are trying to do the previous shift its all behind.
good,"As a checker/cashier, if you do your work correctly and follow policies, nobody bothers you. In other words if you get the job done in accurate manner you are good to go."
good,"At my time at Safeway, I learned a few things. I learned how to talk and interact and work with customers to have a successful outcome. I learned to work hard and work with coworkers efficiently. I learned how to be punctual and accurate and honest in all situations. If ser me up well for future companies."
good,Your average grocery store job pretty fun place to work and decent staff the managers are a bit strict but that is to be expected. The pay was really low though
good,it is a good place to work. just lacking hours depending on area you work in.
good,i learned how to work in a fast pace environment and it was a good place to work while i was in high school. It was a bit under staff so we had to work fast and worked a lot of overtime.
good,My job was just not something I was suited for. It was gross and back breaking. The manager of the deli was ok Mostly but the store manager was not a nice guy.
good,"typical day at work is like any other supermarket it has its moments where its slow and some days where its busy. i didnt learn much at the job it was pretty standard like retail. Management was not that good, always looked out for them selves and never really knew what was going on at the store."
good,Price reducing stack Shelves ensure my work area is clean tidy & presentable for customers. Time management Pulling in loads off lorry. working with good people
good,This company  use to be a good place to work. Over the year the contract for new employees has taken a nose dive.  You now get less benefits and pay raises
good,"tills "
good,"I have learned to do inventory checks, computer accuracy projections, and stock control.Although management does not care as to the work load or how employees are doing with their respective duties."
good,nice work environment. managers can sometimes be rude. If you lose your transportation that becomes a problem. schedule wise they try to work with you. MAJORITY of the time
good,safeway can work to becoming a better company and that sometimes this company not organized and mangers are not nice the benefits could be way higher
good,unloading trucks putting product on shelf and cleaning up afterwards it was part of the union and there was good people to work with
good,"Enthusiastic self-starter with excellent customer service skills. I am passionate about sales and merchandising. Eager at the opportunity to join a dynamic team that rewards initiative and high quality service. Reliable Department Manager with 5 years in retail sales. Coaches and encourages staff toward advancement using an enthusiastic and supportive attitude."
good,the only thing I liked about safe way was that I worked in the bakery department /
good,I loved working for Safeway. I loved the all most everything about that job. I was on my feet a lot  but I met a lot of people. some managers were good and some were not so good.
good,People and staff are nice some not all. I'm there to do a job a leave. Not really interested in job talk so I stay out of it. I'm here to work not run a social experiment do your work and then chit chat but not before
good,The night shift management was pretty inconsistent and arrogant. The work was easy and most co-workers were easy to talk with. I learned how to handle shipments from this job.
good,"I do not get enough hours as a checker and remain part time. "
good,"It was an ok job. we were forced to scrub walls in 120 degree weather. Its hot during summers and you have to get carts. However, the customers make it worth it."
good,"I really liked this job, I liked working with the people but I thought it was time for spending new. Nothing wrong with this job teaches you good costumer service and"
good,a typical day is 8 hrs of standing lift and brewing all manner of coffees. it's not hard just a lot of memorization. expect to clean all day and things get messy that's just how it goes
good,Always stressful; glad to leave at the end of shift. Management does not consider employees needs. Vacation requests are never approved on first submission; always have to re-submit a couple of times before management approves.
good,"The pharmacy at Safeway is unique, as people do not come to Safeway just for their medications as they do at CVS or Walgreen's.  The pharmacy is a convenience, as customers are their mainly to get groceries.  So the work pace is slower than conventional pharmacies.  The only difference with being a technician at Safeway and at CVS is that a tech at Safeway is part of a union, with security of being a union member."
good,there is way to much pressure put onto the store managers to perform and create results and profit it places unreasonable expectations on the employees to achieve objectives that are beyond the means given.
good,Wake up the same time everyday just to find out if you're working or not. always on-call never guaranteed hours. Guys you work with are awesome management can't really help with days working.
good,"Safeway is a great first job. Its a great start to work on customer service skills as well as maintain schooling and a career. theres room for advancement to the right employee. The new management has kinda brought alot of people down. it has become more focused on competing with other store locations- If there is a shortcut, the management teams finds it and takes advantage of it."
good,"A typical day at work is almost like any retail store. You have your good days, you have your bad days. You have to be independent and carry out your tasks, like any worker, diligently. but with a smile!"
good,I worked at Safeway for the bakery department and enjoyed every moment. I especially enjoyed all of the fresh items we made daily. I would recommend Safeway to anyone who loves being around customers and working in a rewarding environment.
good,Great place to be. the people were great.Vary busy place around the end of the year. Management was not that great. I enjoyed come to work everyday. Getting involved with customers
good,"Not a bad place to work at. Lot of standing, stocking and helping customers. Got to know some customers. Not sure what else to put. My coworkers were nice and polite."
good,"Hard on your body, I learned their technology quickly and easily and how to deal with conflict or difficult situations with customers. "
good,my usual day consist of making drinks for customers and cleaning dishes. Some days i close the kiosk so i need to prep for the next day for example pulling out the pastries and making fresh mochas for the next day. My boss and other co-workers think im a very friendly and outgoing person. I love meeting new customer on top of the regular ones
good,I worked for the company for 10 yrs. Worked in pretty much every department in the store when they needed the help. The company was there for me when my husband past. But after the strike they made the lives of everyone that had been there for over 5 yrs miserable. When I asked for a raise or promotion I was told no
good,I gained a lot of my experience here and was taught a lot by some amazing pharmacist. Management played favorites. Pay was low and health benefits were poor.
good,"cashier serving customer and dealing with cash,salary wasn't good, Management t wasn't very supportive. This was not the job for me and it brought an income until i change career"
good,"workplace was  ok good management learn alot of new skills mixed bag of co workers students, mature aged people, hardest part setting up in morning best was dealing with customers"
good,"Each day comes and go like a vapour,just that you get to meet different people with different temperament. there is like one big happy family as the management laid a very good foundation in making everyone get along just fine. the hardest part is seeing people been carried to the morgue,what i like most s seeing a bundle of joy being giving birth to and sick people going back home healthy"
good,Overall Safeway was an enjoyable work experience due to co-workers.
good,as a courtesy clerk i bagged and helped customers to there car.
good,Almost all my co-workers were friendly and made me feel welcome. I enjoyed helping customers and talking to those who wanted to talk to me without being forced into it. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the uninterested customers to talk with me.
good,I enjoyed the regular customers. They would walk in and i would know they drinks to get started on.
good,Asking customer do the need any assist with anything in store.Keep a smile on your face at all times.Management was very strict you had to ask customer in store so they need any help even if they dont need something from your department.Co-worker was great showed me how to get the work done.Dealing with a disrespectful customer and not saying anything back but smiling.Making people day
good,"Loved my coworkers, but management was often disrespectful and/or mean. Management had conflicts of interest with hiring their own kids and hiring their kids’ significant others. Little flexibility given for work scheduling."
good,"I started with minimum wage, after 4 years have same minimum wage. For a full time employee it's so unfair. When asked for transfer to another department even part time,they ignored me. After I wrote my request 2 years ago,they hired a lot of people."
good,"The work day at safeway or any store goes by really slow, but the work is good and the people are nice, very respectful and they take pride in helping others"
good,Working at Safeway is interesting because of the various type of customers that you may have every day. Having amazing coworkers and managers makes the job worthwhile.
good,"Safeway is a busy day-to-day lifestyle.  Its day-to-day business caters to the inner-city public. During my tenure, I learned about the various ways to handle cuts of meats; I learned how to prepare various salads; The workplace culture caters to the inner-city public; The hardest part of the job is, you have to be able to move in a fast pace in order to service each customer in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is, that you get to meet a variety of clientele."
good,They were a good employers for getting your foot in the door and good for learning good work ethic. The were rather accommodating to any help with scheduling.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced throughout the whole day (unless night shift). I learned how to work with various equipment and different types of foods. My first job with Safeway; the management was great! However, when I transferred, the management lacked a lot of things required to run a successful store. I never really paid attention to the work place culture, but it seemed balanced. The hardest part of my job was trying to keep up with all the closing tasks while trying to please the customers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of this job is pleasing the customers and having the feeling of happy satisfaction."
good,"I would start my shift by rounding up all the carts and bringing them back into the store, then I would bag groceries, help customers to their car, open the liquor case, or walk the customers to a certain item in the store. I would then do the sweep log, where I walk around the store and clean up any messes that I come across and then log it on a paper every 30 minutes. When I closed I would have to collect all the garbage, help restock and, tidy up any isles that look messy."
good,"It is a good place to work in the summer or on holidays."
good,Safeway is a decent company to work for. They tend to hire bad managers but the job itself is good. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah b
good,"wouldn't say it was the worst job, but could use a lot of improvement. typical day i would retieve carts, bag groceries and do rest rooms. management can be a pain and don't listen to your concerns"
good,Safeway allowed me to get a taste of working a job. They hired me when I was 16 years old and it was my first ever job. I learned a lot about providing good customer service as well as being part of a team/reliablilty. As a high school student the part time hours were perfect.
good,"It was great workplace until Sobey's took over and several stores had to close down. I had a 40 hours or more before, but after that, part timer lost seniority because of other store's FT moved into my workplace, I had a only 4-12 hours a week.  I couldn't live in Vancouver with such a short hours."
good,I really enjoyed working here. It made me feel part of a family with lots of fun and pride in the job I did. Though pay was low and the hours few it was one of the best work experiences I had.
good,This is a good first time job to get. The management was flexible with my college schedule. The job is simple but it can be stressful at times. The pay and benefits are pretty much nothing and there is virtually no opportunity for advancement. Expect hours to range for morning to night time with some of these shifts frequently back to back.
good,It was alright was a clean environment not everyone was friendly or easy to get a long with but over all it was that bad to work at just don't rely on anyone really
good,"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
good,worked as a part time associate pushing shopping carts for keeping a better health. It is a place to serve customers with excellent job of helping services.
good,This was the best place to work at one time. Most check stands were open and everybody smiled. College kids worked in the evening and the older people worked during the day.
good,Working within DOT.COM they had a really bad scheduling issue. Often worked 14 hour days with no lunch or breaks. Often found myself living there instead of home.
good,"A fast paced work environment with friendly employees, competent management, and great hours until a change in management that saw my hours cut and many undeserved punishments."
good,"It was a pretty okay place to work. There really isn't much to say, i'm literally just filling this out because the site requires it. So I hope you enjoyed wasting your time reading this."
good,"There was no typical routine, schedule, or order in which things had to be done.  It all depended on what had to be done first, you had to prioritize things.  Duties included changing garbages and bottle returns, keeping flyers stocked, bringing the baskets to the front of the store, bringing buggies in from the parking lot, keeping the washrooms clean, assisting customers, doing price checks, product replacements, bagging groceries, and perishable returns for cashiers.  There are also many other duties that may be required of you.  It is a physically demanding job."
good,"The job its self is very easy, I wish that it was easer to move up in the work place but its all about seniority which means that there is very little possibility of raises, and better hours unless your willing to commit to working there your entire life"
good,I learned to package and store meat items. cut and do minor butchering cleaning and sanitizing of meat saws tables slicing machines.
good,"Only a selected few that to sum it all up are most excellent, kind and amazing people along with positive vibes a majority of the time and both professional and personal relationships with co-workers."
good,the only thing I did not like was the fact that I couldn't plan ahead for my life I never knew what I was working until the day before the work week started.
good,"Being a cashier was the first grocery store I ever worked at. There is not much to the job scanning items and processing payment for the items the customer. I worked with a lot of older people so being 18 wasn't that great of a job for me. There is not any room for growth there, my managers said they would transfer me to produce week after week, but it never happened. The management was full of empty promises for being able to improve my job experience but did nothing to back it up."
good,Safeway was an interesting place to work. Due to the union partnership it had security and due to the set wage raises it provided employees with a sense of advancement just by continuing to be long term employees however the benefits werent suited for anyone with a family what so ever.
good,Safeway is a great job for young adults whoa re enrolled in high school or college and have demanding schedules. Not a lot of room for advancement due to seniority issues and union politics.
good,"Setup and teardown deli cases.  Stocking and replenishing hot and cold cases.  Providing Customer Service was main priority and cooking food, slicing meats.  Cashiering and smiling."
good,"Organized daily operations. Safeway is an extremely busy warehouse, with high traffic, with employees from 80-200 on a daily basis."
good,"Working at safeway is a good place to learn more about customer service and that is because the company is mostly built around it. I've learned a lot about how this company runs its stores and what the responsibilites are for the employee's to keep everything running smoothly. Co-workers at safeway are mostly nice and will help you if you run into any problems. There isn't anything hard about working at safeway, as long as you manage your time on what you are doing. The most enjoyable part about working at this company is the great employees and managers."
good,"Did not get much hours, friendly customers, nice place to work"
good,"I always had something to do. The first few weeks my feet hurt incredibly bad after each shift. I worked hard and a lot. I made pretty good money for a 16 year old. Management was okay. I loved almost all of my coworkers and became pretty close to them while I worked there. The hardest part of my job was simply being the only female courtesy clerk because the guys gave me a really hard time and bossed me around. The most enjoyable part was talking to people while i was bagging, getting to know regulars, and just being proud after being able to help someone do/ find things."
good,I really enjoy working at Safeway. It is a fun place to work. I would love to stay at Safeway but can not get enough hours to support myself. I cannot live on 5 hours a week.
good,Typical days are tedious and low paying. Management is often overworked.
good,I tried to help every customer I came in contact with but the results did not ever seem to satisfy my superiors.
good,The people I work with are great.  Micro management in all areas of the company.
good,"It is a good starting job but not one to keep for an extended period of time due to low wages, lack of career advancement and low level of enthusiasm in the workplace."
good,"This position covers positions at the leader level of the Operations Support function. Leaders are knowledgeable in all aspects of project management and will possess an enriched knowledge and fundamentals for the following system software (TSO, ISPF, ESP, JCL, and UNIX). They typically act as project leader, often managing a number of projects that vary in scope."
good,"Enjoyed the customers and working with a variety of people. Employer was great working around my school schedule and other activities. Co-workers are friendly and have great team spirit. The hardest part of the job would have to be ""standing"" for an 8 hour shift."
good,I mostly enjoyed working for Starbucks more than the Safeway deli.
good,"cut meats and cheese when customers ordered, how to use a meat and cheese cutting machine, management always wanted stuff done her way. co-workers were always busy but friendly and helpful, no hard part to the job, enjoyable was to help satisfy and serve customers"
good,The hours at Safeway were confusing. You would go to tell them your availability and they wouldn't always be able to honour it. They would call you unexpectedly on your days off trying to get you to work and would be mad if you couldn't come in for a shift.
good,"Work depends on volume of store, store level management, and the stress level of district management."
good,"There is a lot expected of you for a little to equal compensation. They strive to improve moral but the overall company benefits, pay, and incentives are none existant."
good,The customers and knowing that I could solve any problem and make sure customer leave happy .. enjoyed working with fellow coworkers and helping them solve issues..
good,"working at Safeway the typical workday is clocking in, checking on the carts, looking at the bathrooms, keeping up on cleaning, and making sure that you are able to help others."
good,"My particular store didn’t pay very much mind to my school schedule so I was working 40 hours a week as a high school student. "
good,"In this type of industry you need to be a self starter, motivated, be coach able, need to take direction well. "
good,"Loved the job but wish I worked like wise hours and not scheduled late night, mid shift and days all in the same week.  Benefits would have been nice and pay practice need to be equal for all staff, especially working holidays and weekends"
good,"Made a ton of new friends it was very inviting!  Work life balance is key not working on weekends or off the clock is critical.  Hardest part is the technology changing and adapting,  I appreciate the people at my job most."
good,I enjoy working at Safeway it’s a work place where i can focus and continue to work on my customer service skills. I really enjoy helping all types of races with any problems they might have to keep them warm and happy so they can feel free to come and shop again and always keep and friendly attitude and a positive vibe with everyone.
good,"Working in the bakery was really fun - as it was just a few girls working back there. I got to help decorate cakes, bake cookies and make bread, and package everything, keep the bakery section looking organized and full."
good,Safeway created a lot of opportunity for me by allowing me to train in multiple departments and really helped me be able to work under a lot of pressure. i think people are under appreciated and are not paid what deserved.
good,"I learned new things daily at Safeway, management was fair, coworkers we're nice and also enjoyed their jobs. The hardest part would be having to stand for 8 hours a day."
good,"If you get the hang of your job task fast, that’s all you’ll need. The management when I worked there was bad, they worked off emotion and if you made them mad they would take all of your hours away. Higher up also like to take advantage of newer employees and make them do their job"
good,"Store always has Active , that don't seem like a good sign to me , like my previous job at burger king , so many quit cause of poor work environment , but Safeway isn't really poor , needs a quite bit of work"
good,I learned a lot about management while there and what it was like both as a manager to listen and not to be listened to. I wish they had done more to listen and work with me as it would have been a lot more of a enjoyable experience.
good,If youve ever workes for a corporate grocery store chain they are relatively the same. It's a quick paced and exciting environment. Its a great place to have to job security and benefits.
good,"fast paced work environment, stressful , no overtime, co-workers are friendly, medical benefits, retirement, union, no opportunity for advancement and need better management ."
good,"Safeway is a great company that cares about their employee's, however, the scheduling makes it a bit difficult to make plans in your normal life. Although, Safeway does work with your school schedule, which is nice."
good,A typical work day was long and hard both mentally and phiscaly. i learned that you work hard for what you want and treat others how you wanna be treated. management was horrible at cummunication. the hardest part of the job was magment and costumers. i loved meeting new people and buliding relationships with costumers along with stocking self.
good,"Flexible work hours, co-workers are amazing, management is funky,. Discounts are great, its a union job, love the work environment. The commute was great."
good,it was fun when i was working there but unless i was kissing my managers feet then there was no way i was getting a career advancement. i did learn alot about costumer service.
good,"I started as a courtesy clerk and was promoted several times as a GM - dot com and Starbucks. I then became a checker and later found out that they only promoted me to reset my hours so I would not get a larger raise, pretty shabby Safeway... I then became a department manager because they again did not want me to get a larger raise. However, the experience I got as a manager, to me is priceless. They told me they wanted me to finish schooling but did not want to give me time off to go to school or refund any of my business classes. I ended up quitting to further my education. Now Safeway won't hire me as an intern... Real nice of them."
good,This job paid fairly well depending on the department you work in.  they really stress your breaks and lunches.  If you work part time there are not many benefits.
good,Through out the years at safeway there have been an abundance of job oppertunities that have been of valuable importance to growth and experience. Really great experience overall.
good,Store is okay. They got some good stuff that people needs. But I guess the team/management or some individuals who work there get so wrapped up in our own responsibilities and our own job that we don't see what other people do. Then you have people that do nothing at all. Lack of team work
good,"Apparently the only people who get a break are those in the smoke shop. Nobody else matters as they are the laziest ones in the stores."
good,"Working this job was fairly interesting, learning the culture between all the co-workers, and also with the customers, and learning other areas through co-workers I got to know in the bakery, sandwich, dairy, produce, and meat departments was really fun and interesting."
good,Often too few hours. They we're always fluctuating. But the job was ok. Had too many managers. Could be frustrating at times. Most customers were nice.
good,"Hardest part of job was not giving proper instructions on time, Management was great when working with them, Proper training would help. Most enjoyable part of working there is that you get to meet new people and learn about all the different meats and product they have,"
good,"I used to work in cut fruit in the produce department. I had a lot of fun with the people I worked with. However the work was tedious and the store manager was incredibly controlling and a little crazy. I got paid minimum wage, as did everyone else in produce who wasnt a PIC or Manager. Plus, union dues SUCK. When you're making minimum wage, having even more money taken out is a real buzzkill."
good,"I loved this job with the exception of the culture of Safeway is more important than anything in your life. I am a very dedicated worker so that didn’t get to me too much. However when they took the Deli managers out the union and took away their benefits, I had no choice but to leave."
good,"The work environment was healthy, coworkers were very helpful and friendly, management was lenient, and the overall job experience was blissful, to say the least."
good,"This would be a great place to work if they had full time positions benefits, and a set work schedule. This store location is never fully staffed they cut the hours, only 2 check stands open with long lines of customers. Management wants everything done, but you get reprimanded if you work any overtime."
good,"I was a courtesy clerk, pushed carts bagged groceries helped customers with their baskets of groceries to their car. Had make sure all tasks were done such as cleaning the around the cash registers plus throwing trash, restrooms etc. I always completed all tasks and more."
good,"Able to work independently"
good,"etre rapide et prudent,  accueilir les clients avec respect."
good,Safeway was a nice first place to work but after a while it was annoying. They don't stop hiring so when we don't bring in enough money the hours get cut to like 4 hrs a week. Most of the managers are nice besides the new store manager.
good,"Safeway can be a fun place to work. Front end/cashiers or cashier assistants can be great for part-timers, especially students. Different departments (i.e. Bakery, Deli)  can be a great job for full timers."
good,"If you worked a week at Safeway, it seemed like you worked there forever. Very repititious. Was not geared for advancement if you thought for yourself."
good,The Albertson merger was a nightmare.  The company no longer cared about their employees and there was no loyalty.  The stores were not given enough hours to meet the company's expectations..
good,"Safeway did not give employees 40hrs to avoid from giving them medical insurance which was a downer. At times i would only get 11hours per week , and if i got anything more than 30 hrs it required arriving for a 3am shift."
good,"A typical day at work will consist of cart-pushing, grocery-bagging, garbage-tossing, and helping customers. I learned that work can be rewarding not based on how hard you work, but who you know, management can be your best friend, or a nightmare."
good,busy and sometimes slow..  work load can be a lot in the little time need to complete.  no opnion. If you don't like it or to much do not keep going.  once you are in it really starts to suck
good,Anyone can do it so don't expect more than minimum wage. A need job for a summer. You can move up and get promoted but the pay doesn't get much better until management.
good,"a typical day at safeway was honesty very stressful, we were under a lot of pressure and it was really difficult to keep up w all of managements requests and requirements w the hours we were given. we were not treated equally w other departments, but we always did our best to get our product out, and make everything look decently presented."
good,Managers show favoritism. Work place is messy as far as the people . They act more like friends than managers . Talk about employees amongst eachother.
good,"when there is absent department crew worker and most of the day duties is perform by me "
good,"Clean the meat case while doing markdowns. Put the service meat case in. Run racks of back stock then work out back stock in shelves. Help other departments break down the daily load. Work my portion or the daily load all while helping costumers. "
good,"Great place to find out how to work hard. Was pushed everyday, and will take that with me my whole life. Learned valuable skills in terms of customer relations"
good,"I would make sure everything in cold cases were up to date and replaced. Made sure the product on shelves were dated correctly , In correct order.Stock when needed to."
good,I loved this job.  I started from the bottom and made my way to where I wanted to be.  The reason I left is because I had no more of a challenge for myself.
good,"A typical day is going to the store, loading up your delivery truck with orders which are ready for you to load in plastic totes when you arrive and delivering them to your customers."
good,"worked for them while doing a levels a great job for a small part-time job. co-workers where fun, some upper management could do with training in how to address staff"
good,the lower you are on the todem pole the harder you work. it is cool to have paid sick days and vacation days because you'll need to use them when they cut your hours. Overall Safeway has been a great experience. I love what I do even though its a tough job dealing with angry customers who think its my fault they're having a bad day.
good,"it was okay , just making a lot of sandwhiches giving a smile in every sandwich I make . I was washing a lot of pots it was hard washing the big ones but I managed. preparing meat was the best part, I liked weighing it"
good,"Good HR Dept"
good,"I enjoyed my employment with Safeway. "
good,"Provided me with a job while I went to school. Up until the last couple months, I was given enough hours to pay my bills, but then school got in the way and I had to quit."
good,"Competitive wages, zero benefits. Hard work, tight schedules, good management. You drive trucks, move orders around to fit an aggressive time-frame, and deliver groceries."
good,"Normal shifts would be between four hours and eight hours of customer service and cleaning of the store. Responsibilities included bagging groceries for customers as well as taking care of trash and helping other departments that needed help. "
good,I mostly enjoyed working at Safeway it wasn't horrible. it was nice to get acquainted with the community of anaconda. some of the customers were god awful but then some were very amazing.
good,"We were always busy working on stocking the shelves or dealing with costumers. We were regularly short handed and always had more than enough work to do but we always managed to finish on time. We never got to see management because they came in after we left as we worked all night long, this made it increasingly difficult to communicate."
good,"Good place to work, very busy during seasonal periods throughout the year. Management was okay, team work was okay. There was a lot to do in the beginning of the day, but not enough to keep me busy after lunch time. I found things to do even if it wasn't my designated job title. I tried to help other coworkers out as much as needed when I could."
good,I had some of the best co-workers ever. I learned how to be the best at what I set my mind to. I am a people person and love working with the public. Management could of been more hands on but they do the best that they could. Cleaning up after someone else all the time is what I considered the hardest part of my job. Best part was the friends that I made.
good,"A typical day consists of making sure parking lot is clean and trash has bee taken out. Go to your station and clean it, making sure you have the right amount of money before you open. If its slow, you help out by stocking the shelves."
good,"limited opportunities for advancement."
good,"review almost 1000 items for inventory control, check on code dates and necessary distress if needed.  Check on logistics and late trucks."
good,Its ok place to work. Not really a life with this job. I am looking to transfer closer to home. I work hour and half away.
good,i loved this job and the opportunity that i had to get to know all of the different people. The best part of the job had to be learning everyone. Helping people and seeing that they left happy. The worst part of it was having to clean the gas pumps outside in the ice cold and snow.
good,You were expected to do what you werent trained for on low income.
good,"I was employed as a barista at the starbucks kiosk. I had a weird first few months as my manager was on medical leave and returned about 2 months into my employment. After she came back things turned around and I really blossomed. They take great pride in their customer service and depending on the area that you serve the customers will be interesting. Always be friendly, even if you aren't feeling it, you never know if someone is a secret shopper. Being nice can get rewarded by customers and managers alike. The union is nice but the majority of your check goes to it. Part time is not liveable by any standard so try to get a full time spot. "
good,My typical day at work helping out customers with their orders and making sales on the sales floor. I've learned how to multitask very well and my customer service skills have increased dynamically. The management here is very strict but also very flexible. Just do your job and you will be fine. My co-workers are really nice people and they work hard to work as a team. The hardest part of my job is never getting my raise. I worked here for three years and I remain at minimum wage. Its hard. The most enjoyable part of my job is that employees act like a family and so do the regular customers that walk in.
good,short hours did not make enough money to stay. the people was ok. wasnt a bad place to work.
good,Safeway has been a great place to work while attending college. There is valuable knowledge to be gained from learning the many ways a business functions and how to lead a diverse team of people.
good,I learn through Communication with others
good,"Always had many functions to perform during a typical day. Management was only concerned with the bottom line. As long as you met goals, management was happy. We only had a few full time workers & scheduling for them to be present at peak times was a challenge in an outlying location. Most enjoyable were the patients. Lots of positive encouragement from the patient population."
good,I have learned a lot working at Safeway how to help manage a company to make floral arrangements. Management can be over baring at time and not very helpful. Did not receive as much training as you would think working fir a big corporation.
good,learned how to provide superior customer service.
good,"This was my first ob and here I learned how to be a caswhier, courtgesy clerk, stock, do janitorial work. It was always busier during holiday which made me learn how to control the balance othe ups and doesn of speed required to complete the job."
good,"Need to be able to lift upwards of 80lbs."
good,All in all Safeway was a great first company to work for but over the years I was admired and needed so much in my department that there wasn't any room for growth in the store for me. I never got the full store experience I wanted in the workplace.
good,"Stocking at Safeway is a good job, the functions of the job are easy enough to get done in a timely matter,  but when the shift hours change allot and the store switches the management you lose the foundation an everything becomes Unorganized."
good,"Fun working with co-workers and learning new things for the job, Having help when needed. Nice, fun, and exciting people to work with. Always trying to get the job done when we can and helping as much customers when needed. "
good,Its an ok job for the money. Some overtime. The scheduling sucks they schedule is only a week out hard to request time off. Store is constantly cutting hours.
good,"It was an alright job, can't complain much since it was easy and didn't require too much effort. Working as a courtesy clerk is an easy job and a good starting job."
good,"This was my first job and it taught me a lot. The management, however, was constantly changing so there were times when I would do a job or task and it would be overlooked. There was bias or unfair advantages for certain coworkers while others were never given a chance to advance or grow."
good,"Again it was not a place I enjoyed working at, very hard to be there. The management was not great, they could be very very pushy and mean, I would prefer to have nice calm and more relaxed management. Along with that it was not the cleanest place."
good,Can be alot of work. So.etimes it's a team effort most times individual. I've worked at 3 stores and only 2 I would recommend. Managment and staff play a big part on weither the store is a fun and safe place to work.
good,"The job has okay hours/weekly pay but,its not organized on how they run their company as far as hours or overtime hours.it is a great job fulll-time/part-time if you just need money in your pocket and not picky on your amount of pay for the need of your living situttion."
good,Working for safeway over the years i had gone from a grocery bagger to a department manager within 5 years. if your looking for advancement you have to be ready and looking constantly as new opportunities are always coming up
good,"It is a good starting job for any teenagers looking for part time money. For my years of working there, it took almost 6 months for me to be moved to a different department after constantly asking management."
good,"I worked at this store twice. Once years ago before their remodel and now again for some extra money. I never expect much from a grocery store, but this is ridiculous. Other workers aren't interested in helping new ones, and are borderline almost hostile when asked. There was no training and lots of laughing and looking down at you if you screwed up. And forget about confidentiality here, one person knows something and EVERYONE knows. No accountability for anyone. Managers all seem to be new (or something). No one even wants to be bothered with customers! Customer service should ALWAYS be number one. I've seen night stockers on the ground stocking not move and get mad at customers for bugging them, front end managers be downright rude to customers for being expected to do their jobs....I wouldnt recommend this store in MD to anyone. Dont do it, I'm regretting it."
good,check emails make sure gas prices didn't change then check the notebook management would write in then check in to the register help customers. IF it wasn't to busy we would clean outside go up to the store restock. then take out trash at the end of your shift. while doing all the duties you are assigned throughout the day.
good,"Safeway is super fast pace which is nice cause your day goes by really fast. for the most part everybody in the departments are really nice and fun to work with its just the managers who are so rude and don't show appreciation nor do they just smile and say hi how is everything??? for the work we do at Safeway, the employees should get wat more respect."
good,I enjoyed my time at Safeway. The people I worked with in the meat dept and other areas of the store were great for the most part. Most of the managers I met were friendly and helpful.
good,great company .  They treat you very well . And they are very understanding when you call out sometimes. Be on time and do your job correctly you will love it there
good,A typical work at Safeway will have its up's and downs you will never know what your day is going to be like until you clock in and work a whole shift.
good,"A typical day at at work at Safeway on graveyard shift would be either stressful and exhausting one night, or easy and effortless one night. However, I would recommend the job."
good,"The hours are very inconsistent, and the management isn't all that fantastic either. If you felt sick or try to call in sick, they ,make you feel guilty for something out of your control."
good,"worked as a courtesy clerk/cashier. "
good,"I have worked at the Phoenix PCS location for about 7 Months, It has been a great experience, The company is going through a lot of changes, so they are laying off most of the contractors I have no been let go yet, nor do I know if I will."
good,"Working at Safeway is a fun and relaxing place to be, friends can be made easily and everyone will always be there for each other. Teamwork is one of the most important rule that we follow."
good,"We we're always under staffed. Turn over"
good,"it was a ok place to work but the room for advancements does not happen. Management will work with you on scheduling problems. The pay scale is not high enough, they expect a lot for little pay to the people."
good,"I work in a rather small department (30 people or so). Family type setting. I was able to transfer to this department from another which was a great move for me. "
good,"Safeway is a great comany to work for and an actual career you can grow in. I just got stuck at a bad safeway. As a CC you do carts, bagging help, sweeps, and go backs. As a checker, you interact with customers while you check them out of the store."
good,Overall I love working here. I love my coworkers. But I don't get enough hours. The atmosphere is good. Typcically it's not a stressful job. However my manager lacks good leadership.
good,Customer service was key and I enjoyed that aspect of the job. The schedule fluctuated each week so the work life balance was at times difficult due to the lack of consistency. The answers provided in the 'rate this company' are based on the time period for which I was employed by Safeway and not by todays standards.
good,The deli was really hard to keep up the speed but once you take your time you understand and come up with other away to help you better yourself. I would say the cleaning was the the part for me. Cleaning the deli had to be done a different away everything the steps on how to clean.
good,"I had quite a bit of success with the company but it can be difficult, sometimes you are just a number to management. You have to self motivate in order to succeed."
good,I enjoyed multi tasking and learning the different areas in the Deli dept. I didn't like is that I was promised a better pay rate and never got it after 2 yrs.. where people hired after me did..
good,"as a part-time job it was good, I enjoyed preparing flowers for sale, had great work environment with customers, enjoyable part of the job was when worked longer hours."
good,"Great co workers, questions answered when needed. Fast paced environment. Great customers that came in for medications. Most enjoyable part of job was working with co workers and the customers. Loved learning the different parts of the pharmacy. All and All a great place to work."
good,"They have hard working staff that try to accomplish a multitude of tasks in a very short time allotted. Can be a very difficult job on the body. Management do not care about the employees, they are more concerned on the bottom line."
good,"You can be easily undervalued by management but it is good to meet lots of good people and hard workers, you can be the hardest worker and not well recognized at the same time which gets annoying if you're trying to get something out of working hard. Hardly appreciate your hard work."
good,"If you're a student looking for a part time job, they provide flexible hours within the store. The bakery atmosphere has a lot more work, but you don't have to deal with as many people."
good,It is a great place to work as a student or for your first job. Typical minimum wage experience with a few added perks. Not perfect by any means but they do their best.
good,Fulfill my pharmacist graduate intern duties along with technician and clerk duties daily. Administered CDC recommended vaccines to 5 years and older.
good,other than the manager that ran this store i would have stayed if i could but my body had other plans for me and so i had to leave but my co workers and i are still friends and i still visit just for the heck of it
good,I enjoyed working here but my manager was hard to deal with and constantly in my face. I would have enjoyed working there better if i had gotten proper training
good,"handling and doing prep work every morning, as well as helping out the meat dept. if needed. learn a lot about how to handle the supervisor role. management in the store was a little lacking, never a clear direction where to go how to improve as a dept. the most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers."
good,"Very fast-paced and if you're not ready for the job or think you can't do it, you probably got hired for the wrong position. You can either do this job in the deli or you cannot. Lots of heavy lifting and pressure constantly. Double shifts are sometimes a requirement. This job is like a marriage but I would recommend it to anyone."
good,"lots of walking and lifting, learned to manage time and pace, motivating leaders, friendly atmosphere, decent breaks and lunch, safety is top priority."
good,Can get away with doing nothing as long as u look like your working . If you are a backup checker expect to be in a checked and your whole shift. Expect to get nothing done with poor manager who don't like to check
good,"Typically day of work was routine and never had an extreme variable change. Overnight hours make it hard to have both the work life and outside life of enjoyment as well as productivity harder then an average. The co-workers and Management were skilled and showed an understanding of there position equally, yet the companies wages were not competitive."
good,"- hardest part of job - low on staff"
good,"Busy days every day which is good, management where staff orientated which made the work place much better. I learnt alot about supermarket culture . ."
good,"I was a temporary person worked on entering invoices into their system and SAP.  Was a new area of work for me and I enjoyed it"
good,Didnt't really dislike it I actually had fun when i worked there. There is on and off days to any job but i still kind of felt like a team player and a friend to my fellow coworkers and managers.
good,"Working Courtesy Clerk was a decent job, I enjoyed working with the manager who hired me, however the new manager made the job a nightmare. During this job I learned self control and what good customer service. This job was challenging enough to learn something, but easy enough to enjoy it.  The hardest part was the new manager; she had high expectations but did not know how to speak to her staff appropriately and accused without facts.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and talking with the children."
good,"Although I was only employed for a short time, Safeway was a good place to work and the hours were flexible.  Working at the gas station was interesting."
good,"What I did most of the day was bag groceries, retrieve shopping carts, restock shelves, clean areas that got dirty such as spills, build up, and spot cleaning. I learned the ins and outs of grocery retail. Management has a strong presence, mainly because the workers were young, and inexperienced. Management worked just as hard as the employees. My co-workers were just as busy as me most of the time. The hardest part of my job would be walking across the huge store to do something urgent, so I did a lot of power walking. My favorite part of the job was the dairy freezer. In Arizona it was hot, so the cold isles, and freezer were always refreshing."
good,"Co workers are great people, very helpful and great role models, but the management is very iffy. Not enough people to staff the place and the hours everyone almost doesn't cover all of the hours to keep open."
good,"My first experience with retail work was at Safeway; employees are friendly, the managers worked with my schedule around my current college classes, and I got to learn customer service skills. However, pay is minimum wage for a job that is long hours and hard on your feet with short breaks."
good,"The typical day at work goes slowly, I've learned a lot about customer service, a lot about cleaning messes, and about how many carts I can bring into the store in one go. The management could be slightly better. The hardest parts of the job are cleaning bigger messes, bringing all of the carts in before a certain hour, and dealing with the ruder customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is going on lunch and getting great deli food."
good,I had no work life balance as a direct result of working in the night crew meaning that in order to maintain my sleep schedule for adequate performance I needed to sleep during everyone else's waking hours meaning I couldn't really socialize.
good,Pay is of course very low and raises are infrequent and negligible. My personal experience has been positive because my schedule has been very easy to move around for school.
good,"Safeway is a decent company to work for as a first job while in your teens.  I was trained in all aspects of the company, but I was never given a full time position."
good,"The job was really easy since it was just a grocery store. The staff was not that great, They let the employees do what they want, They would hold people responsible for their actions. people working there didn't really care, some lazy and laid back. The paid was ok and for part time the hours I got were pretty good."
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with, they were very understanding, If i needed to switch schedules we always worked something out. They are a very ""Customers first"" kind of company."
good,I learned so much here and had a great experience. Most of my managers were caring and understanding and made work life easier. I highly recommend for first time job seekers.
good,"Come in early to work dressed in a clean uniform and walk out onto the floor with a smile on your face."
good,"Work with grocery procurement specialists purchasing grocery all across the United States.  Working with internal and external teams ive gained and expert level of knowledge of the grocery business as a whole.  Covering not all procurement, but demand planning and the business impacts of sale and merchandising.  Hard working company with good communication and cooperation across teams to achieve results and minimize conflicts in business operations."
good,"Enjoyed all aspects of this job including management and coworkers.  Unfortunately, there was little room for growth or training even when I continually asked to learn and move forward."
good,"Work could either be very busy or very slow. The people are very nice and will help in anyway possible. The pay is low, but the job is not that bad. From time to time there would be some challenging things to achieve, but it's OK."
good,"i was a courtesy clerk and they had me running around doing every other job but my own, it seemed like every day i was doing someone elses job"
good,"A regular business day at Safeway usually begins with making sure everything is stocked ,trash taken out , and entrances and bathrooms cleaned before customers come in. Having worked at vons prior to this job I new what to expect but I never thought this store location would be so different . Management is unfortunately very poor which has caused a decline in morale throughout the entire staff . The hardest part of the job for me is when I am contactly having to clean up either after the employees the worked before me or after other departments but I'd have to say the most enjoyable part of the job is being the last face the customer see before the leave , I always like to make sure they leave with a smile on their face."
good,"Pros: Good Pay, Great Benefits, room for advancement."
good,"We had a great team at work, So it was always been fun working at Safeway. Flexible Hours & Great family time made my job easier & happy family."
good,Grocery store clerk who assisted with scanning bagging and carting of items managment could have been more helpful and many of the costumers were unneededly rude
good,"A typical day working as a produce clerk is stacking fruits and vegetables on tables, and throwing out the bad ones. My co-workers were great, and really fun to work with."
good,"I worked as a Deli- Clerk, my job was to prepare lunch meats, make sandwiches or cook food for hot case. We had to feel the case by 9:30 AM and it was more stressful by lunch because we had a large amount of people waiting for food"
good,Safeway was a great company to work for but the benefits were non existent. The shifts were short and the days were slow. Some of the management was great but same had no idea how to run a store.
good,A typical day while i was employed at vons was 14hrs and was just ridiculous. Sometimes had to work 6 days a week but a salary position as it was at the time was unexpectedly difficult.
good,I worked for safeway after its conversion from albertsons. I never missed a day of work and sacrificed much of my life to that job. They treat the best workers horribly and the people who don't show up and are not very good workers good. I don't like to talk really bad about places but that's my review.
good,Great place to work when you want to move up quick and are hard working and willing to work. Flexible with your schedule. management could use some help though.
good,"A co-worker made me do all the work while she was cutting up her fruits, while i was doing my part of the job. She made me clean her dishes and whatever she used after her shift. Then after her shift I told her off, that i was stressed out, so she did it again later on. SUCKED!"
good,"Vons was a solid grocery retail company before the divestment."
good,"As a new employee at Safeway, for the interim, working there is hard work. One must have patience. The customers are fine, the workload is common and manageable for someone with a good work ethic, but the management for the Deli appears less than experience for the position. "
good,Not a very good place to work. Was a great learning experience. Horrible working environment. A very toxic work environment.
good,Great company but needs to pay their employees better. They give employees great opportunities to save money inside and outside the store.
good,a typical day at work would be helping people around the stores with locating items taking go backs to their right shelves getting the shopping carts out of the parking lots. i worked self checkout for a a few months as well so that was cool managing what goes on in the self sufficient aisle. Had pretty cool coworkers for the most part some i really didn't care for. The most enjoyable part was being able to help customers with exactly what they needed to be helped with.
good,"I feel like the expectation for excellent service was near impossible with the lack of employees.the turn over was atrocious.My manager for the first 7 years was amazing.He taught me that to be a good manager,your employees must know all that you know.They are there to make your job easier.Just like me being manager of my department made his job as a store manager,easier.Being the diversity champion for our store was intresting.I was able to meet higher ups and really see the teams that safeway has for each and every promo and employee related camp[aigns."
good,"My shift started at 10pm and ended at 6am the next morning.  It was difficult at first but I started to get in a routine.  The downside about working there during my shifts were I slept most of the days away.  I didn't really have a life.  I slept during the days and worked all night.  The upside was the other employees that I worked with were amazing.  They turned slow, quiet nights into talkative and upbeat nights."
good,"I enjoyed working in the produce department because it offered me something to do throughout the entire work day, and I absolutely love produce. I had to have knowledge of all the fruits and vegetables, as well as help all customers with any needs they might have had."
good,"I would cook all the foods slice all the meats and cheeses, and setup the hot case. Lots of customer service all day long.  Make and wrap sandwiches.  I would set-up the salads."
good,It wasn't a work place I would have enjoyed staying in for any length of time! It was completely unorganized and unstructured.
good,"Working at Safeway was quite the experience for me. the store i worked in was the busiest in our district. managements focus seemed to be solely on our competitors and not so much on managing. it seemed as though i was back in high school, instead of constructive criticism generally used by managers you would hear what you had done wrong after it had traveled down the grape vine. Some coworkers worked hard, others who had adapted to the union, not so much. Though it was a good experience the store itself needed better management. instead of always doing the job, and doing it right the first time, the store managers insisted on their ways until their managers decided to walk through. then it was a frantic shuffle for the managers to pick up the slack, and as soon as the higher ups would leave it was back to normal. i always told the heads that they should surprise visit, if they really wanted to see the state of the store. whenever they did they were not pleased. i was a backup cashier, but i say that loosely, basically i was more of a back up stocker. they never would have enough actually cashiers, even though all that were hired were lucky to make 25 hours a week. instead they insisted on taking me from the dairy and putting me in the check stand for hours at a time, needless to say the dairy didn't always get done. besides the management it is a good place to work, the union never really helped with anything, but the atmosphere was generally positive as long as management wasn't brought up. it was a good job that i would have enjoyed and probably kept if not for the management,"
good,"I loved my co-workers and customers, I usually make the workers laugh and my customers. My typical day at work would consist of making orders and taking payment for it while interacting with my customers . I had to work fast because I operated the Starbucks alone but I had to still be polite and have fun with the customers. I learned how to multitask and work at a fast pace while still being diligent at my job. The hardest part about the job would have to be getting the closing duties done before my shift was over because I still had to serve the customers until my shift ended and close. The thing I enjoyed the most would have to be the customers because I made a lot of connections with my customers. I also did not like the management."
good,"It was a great place to work, I didn't work there for very long, but it was a good start for experience, and they're pretty relaxed as long as you do what you're supposed to."
good,"They did not post a job I wanted. By the time I knew it was up, they'd closed applications. All started well. I made a few friends. I had to go through a medical treatment. They were fairly nice about it. Fired me before the second treatment started. I feel that I shouldn't have told them about it. I thought a head's up was only polite."
good,"They didn't pay you what they told you  would start at. They paid less. They had you work 7 or more days in a row at 8 hours a day. Never any consistency in the scheduling."
good,"Open shift Prepare cook food for the hot case "
good,I was a cashier for Safeway for the most part of a year. Most days I would spend prepping the store before customers came in as well as provide customer service tasks from time to time. I would say mot of the people that worked there were easy going and I everyone was easy to get along with
good,"Safeway is going through transition having been bought out by Cerebus. You can make a career at Safeway into anything you want, plenty of room to advance."
good,"I worked at safeway for almost 3 years. I had some good managers."
good,"A typical day working for the safeway, fun and easy ive learned how to help the customers with their purchases,co workers are really fun to be around they actually help the day go by faster. the hardest part about the job was getting more hours, the most enjoyable was management."
good,"I really enjoyed helping those who came into the store. I have always been a people person so it was really easy to have a good conversation with people I had just met. I always had a genuine smile on my face when I got to make costumers days easier and or happier by giving my service and full attention to them."
good,"I handle multiple calls from customer, employees, store management, and truck drivers. I assist over the phone and through email. I respond to letters, code productivity, comment cards, store support, online support, and additional duties depending on the night."
good,Supply chain support for computer generated ordering project for retail stores.  Support and customer service for retail stores through SQL management and on line support.  I supervise one direct report and have one supportive supervisor.  Good working environmnet.
good,"A typical day would include making quality drinks for customers, occasionally checking out items from the grocery store, cleaning equipment, restocking supplies, throwing out food past its safe period, and closing or opening the kiosk. Through working at the Safeway Starbuck's Kiosk I learned how to make a variety of drinks, how to operate a cash register, how to work in a fast paced environment, and how to multitask. My co-workers were energetic and hard working. They gave excellent customer service everyday. The hardest part of the job was the fast pace and efficiency. You had to take orders while making drinks, often working on several drinks at once in addition to cleaning up after yourself as you went. As you are alone at times you are under a lot of pressure to work quickly without flaws. This could be challenging at times, but at the end of the day it paid off. The most enjoyable part of my job was the smiles you would get from people when you made the perfect latte or the little conversations you might exchange."
good,"A typical day at work included providing great customer service skills along with cleaning the store and bagging groceries. I learned to provide great customer service, no matter the customer's actions and diffuse any arguments amongst people. my coworkers were all team players and provided a fun work enviornment. the hardest part of this job is making sure to multitask to the best of your ability. the most enjoyable is working with the customers."
good,Safeway does not appreciate their employees. It seems like their belief is run them into the mud then replace them. I liked my supervisors and coworkers but the general business ethics are horrible. My coworkers used to say we worked for Slaveway.
good,nice people to work with until merger - lots of long term employees until then
good,I find out what table or section is mine and wait for guest to be seated. I offer beverages while the patrons decide what to order. I also up sell on items by offering larger items. After patrons leave i clean my table for the next guest to be seated.
good,"Safeway dist center was a great place to work ,but long hours and 2nd shift wasn't good for me."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty basic, serve customers, cut meat, make bulk salads, work on production, face shelves, etc.."
good,"safeway over all is a pretty good place to work, however they are not the best for pay. but if you work hard you can easily advance in the company and they have lots of oppertunities for better schooling in the areas you want to advance in."
good,"great experience,learning the different cut in the meat the butchers were great to work with."
good,"It was a cool job to work beside's being cold inside there, I ran the register cleaned And use great customer service skills."
good,"Always on your feet there is always something to do. For me there was not enough employees in my department, and found myself doing a lot of work but paid very little."
good,I enjoy working here I just don't see it as a life career for me. I really do love the people I work with they are great and good team players. I do my grocery shopping there they have great product and prices very family friendly.
good,"Typical work day started by seeing the schedule for carts and cleaning then getting to work bagging until my scheduled time to gather carts or clean. Managers were kind and respectable along with co-workers. Always did the job and had friendly conversations. Hardest part of the job  was staying friendly with rude customers, but do able. Most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers. We would have fun appropriate conversations."
good,"A typical day at work for Safeway consists of ensuring customers needs are taken care of quickly and efficiently as well as communicating with managers on what is needed. "
good,"i would gather carts, bag groceries, and price check merchandise for customers."
good,"Management was very micro managing... "
good,"Safeway is a grocery store that is consistently busy. I would come in, greet customers, bag their groceries, answer any questions and i kept the store clean"
good,I enjoy the customer and the job.  I wanted a full time job. So i took the ohsu job. I thought it would be better. 
good,"-packing merchandise for customers"
good,"Safeway was, by far and large, an excellent company to work for.  Had it not been for a huge commuting distance and some personal issues, I would probably still be working for them gladly.  The only drawbacks are that, like most large corporations, they have very unrealistic expectations for shrink and payroll expenses, and their customer service program is a little over-weaning, often at the expense of being more convenient or providing better prices.  "
good,"This job was great, sadly I had to quit because of medical issues I was going through at the time."
good,"i wish that i would be allowed to get on the computer and learn the hands on aspect of the job,."
good,"i work from 6am to 2:30pm and get to work with customer and co work on the service. i learned that everyone don't know a lots when it come down to foods and the different tape of food there is out there in the world, also the different tape of meat that come from a animal. The hardest part of the job is working with co-work that don't do anything but walk around all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you help a customer out with there need and make them feel good about coming into the store again."
good,Loved working here for my first job. Customers were amazing and co workers were great. However I have been there almost 5 years and have never had a raise and the company has lost my hours in order to give me one. The only way to move up is if you go into management which there is rarley any openings for that. And when management does something shady there is no one to talk to or nothing will be done about it.
good,High standards Customer Service
good,I was let go because I have a mental disability in which they knew about upon hire. I do believe that's discrimination and would never consider working there again and would not recommend it to anybody
good,"I enjoyed working at Safeway, it was a part time job while at school."
good,"Responsible for shift scheduling, Personal Mangement, Inventory Control. Completed management Training Program. Planned weekly special menu, made changes where necessary. Primary responsibility to serve the highest quality food at lowest possible cost."
good,Safeway is a good company. They provide benefits and an enjoyable work experience and valuable product.
good,"always busy, taking care of customers, making sure store always looks presentable, checking and answering emails, delegating duties, taking care of employee lunches and breaks, and printing store reports. In this job position i have learned to multi task, how the store is ran, and how to relate to customers. Management has always been wonderful. My co workers have become my good friends. The hardest part of the job is i had to sacrafice alot of family time, i never had a set schedule. pulling off finishing all the duties and projects assigned to me. sometimes the day doesnt go as planned and so much can go wrong. The most enjoyable part of my job was everday was different and some days were a bigger challenge. I've made many friends with customers and employees."
good,"Was team friendly, nice place to work. "
good,"Overall, it was the supervisor's within the company that made this workplace a positive place to go to everyday. I was quickly trained in my department and given many opportunities to improve myself as an individual worker and a team member."
good,"You will be given plentiful opportunities to seek guidance and understanding about what your job is and how you can do it to the fullest of your ability. There isn't an answer that you cannot find from the supportive management team. Unfortunately, that also regards personal information. Be cautious with what information you share. By the end of the night, everyone will know about it."
good,"Safeway is a great company to work for, all other aspects of the departments are great except the bakery. The employees that had been there forever were extremely rude, the manager wasn't cooperating. Outside of the bakery, Safeway is a excellent place to work."
good,"Food production driven.  Time management is key, you have to move pretty steadily to accomplish all tasks.  Learning to be flexible and help co-workers when needed is important.  The most challenging part of my job, is to accomplish all of my tasks everyday.  This becomes difficult because in addition to completing my daily list of items to make, I have to assist customer at the counter with their deli orders.  I really like the customers and providing great customer service."
good,Enjoyable work place and good people to work with. Unfortunately relocated living location and could no longer work with the company. Would recommend for good valet position
good,"The benefits that come with the job are great, and if you like getting paid weekly it might be the place for you. You don’t get much training so that’s a downfall!"
good,"We were brought in to make all the needed changes in their databases, because Albertsons bought out Safeway. Work was repetitive and quite simple.  I made all necessary changes in their PeopleSoft database for employees salaries, and pay raises; as well as job titles.  At times there would be benefit changes for certain employees."
good,"I work the Night Crew, and it's a hit or miss with hours. They say they'll give you more, but never do. So I just take what I can and look for other and better opportunities within the store."
good,"This was a long time ago, the company has since been bought out by another company, so my review would not be accurate in any way at this frame of time"
good,I felt Safeway was a great place to work everyone has been there for many years so they were a great team. Everybody helped everybody out. Very clean and loyal customers
good,"Produce departments at Safeways in Canada can be excellent places to work: relative autonomy due to its location in the store, light work loads (50 lbs and under), and collaborative atmosphere.  Products are on the pricier side so you rarely deal with drunks and vagrants; mostly only middle-class customers from suburban areas.  Opportunities to advance are plenty as turnover for supervisors and managers can be pretty high.  Beware of corporate culture: if they fast-track you for management, most likely they are grooming you to work at a small store across the country.  Don't make too many plans with your ever-increasing pay, since you will be stopped dead in your tracks if you turn down a position out-of-province.  For students though, this is a good job with relatively little demand."
good,"The typical day was busy.  I learned to use deli, meat cutting machinery, and how to work in the food service business.  The management was fair.  The hardest part that I found about the job was that, everything that you were expected to do was on a time clock."
good,"the work is easy, just laborious, lots of lifting, stocking, and time management. slightly repetitive and rarely fulfilling, but the work environment, people and coworkers, make it all worth it"
good,Enjoyed the people. Helpful and friendly and well organized. Hard workers and fast paced. The job just got too repetitive for me. Lots of benefits and the best team environment that I have worked in.
good,Safeway has benefits to offer. Management is great and the people is great. A great place to get work experience and advancement. Lots of work areas to apply within the company. Safeway works with its personnel to provide a better work environment and opportunities
good,"it was a great experience for me to work in that industry. there were great people who I work with. Learn many things such as communicating with customers, answering phone calls"
good,Everything was good working at Safeway but they had really poor management and coworkers was horrible but customers was good I have a fun time with cust
good,"fast paced and stressful environment"
good,i like working at safeway i just need more money than im being paid right now and i also feel singled out because i can not do as much as my co workers.
good,"Management kind of has their own way of doing things. I believe I don’t get paid enough for all of the duties I perform. Days are busy, but there are some times where it’s slow."
good,I had a lot of friendly co workers loved working there and I'd work there again if I could the customers are really great as well made me smile everyday
good,"It can be a tough job. There is always a lot to do and the hours can be difficult, but the compensation is worth it. Plus there is always room to grow within the company."
good,I started in Starbucks when I was hired.  I was cross trained in several departments within a year. I appreciated learning and promoting. I felt like an asset to the company. But over worked and under paid.
good,"This job is a great opportunity for anyone looking for their first job, to get their foot in the door, and gain some work experience under their belt. There are multiple departments from which you can choose to work in and expand your work skills. Working here is about creating a connection with customers and providing an enjoyable shopping experience. There is one ongoing issue with being understaffed due to there not being enough hours -- this becomes frustrating for customers because of extended wait times in line. Workers feel the pressure as well, as they attempt to speed up the process to keep their customers happy. Although there are stressful moments throughout the day, it is helpful to have a supportive work team that guides each other to better serve our customers and remind each other to remain calm and smile."
good,Everyone one there did there jobs efficiently. I usually worked 7am-3pm or work evenings from 2pm-10pm. I stocked shelves worked dairy orders and was trained on the till.
good,This was my first work experience. I attended school half a day and worked as well throughout my 12th grade year. I learned how to save my money while getting paid weekely.
good,"Fast paced throughout store"
good,"clock in  and find out where you are needed. Run a cash machine with debit, check, ebt. make sure registers are fully stocked with supplies needed through out shift. Communicate with others working in your department. Communicate with management as needed. take care of Customer's first. stock items if needed. clean. make it a work friendly and customer friendly environment for all."
good,"As I manager there I can say that they were lacking in many ways, and I would've done things differently. for example, I would take customer recommendations seriously. I would also value the employee's we have and make sure they're comfortable with they're jobs."
good,"Safeway/Albertsons is a major grocery store chain.  They have been around for a long time and are a secure place to work.  You become part of a union, adding to the security."
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and with the public. Customer service is key to a successful day! Staying busy is easy here as there is always something that needs to be done!
good,I am proud that Safeway was my first job it taught me how to have a good work ethic and what it is like to have a job. it will give you an opportunity to see what type of people that live in your community. It will give you the opportunity to see how good your patience is. Working at Safeway has shown me just slight of a hint of what life is going to be like.
good,I enjoyed working at Safeway. My job was stressful and dangerous at times but I felt like I was making a difference in the Stores by preventing those who steal from leaving the store. The pay was decent compared to other Asset Protection positions in the Denver/Aurora area. This job proved to me how patient I am. Dealing with combative shoplifters can take a toll and you need to have the ability to remain professional even when the people you are contacting are not.
good,It was a decent overall medium wage job only problem was some of the regular customers and poor equipment to work with. My Co workers and superiors were very professional and understanding
good,Family member was sick and they didn’t let me take off I told them the person can pass away they didn’t care so I had to leave this job when it’s was time for me to come back they didn’t let me because I so called didn’t have doctors paperwork:
good,"The people I worked with were wonderful.  I just didn't have an interest in working in grocery retail for the rest of my life, but I enjoyed it while I was there."
good,i really enjoyed working for safeway they taught me many things that will help me future wise and career wise. definitely would recommend anyone to work for safeway
good,"I liked working at Safeway, they have great perks and fun employee events. Fast passed call center. I worked in several departments and enjoyed each one."
good,They do value their employees but they over work them especially in IT.  They could do a lot of restructuring to allow for those not to have to work 12 hour days.
good,i enjoyed working there and i was glad they gave me the opportunity it was fast paced at times but also quite slow the co workers and managers were nice it was a very clean store
good,"Well first I do my distressed with tellzon gun. Then I work my back stock of bread and then my new stuff. Then I do my ordering for the bread and frozen. Then I work the hostess on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Then after lunch around like 9:00am I am up front bagging doing carts, sweeps, and go backs if there are any to do. There are like five mangers in the store throughout the day. One general manger and four assistant manger helping out throughout the day stocking shelf. In the workplace culture it is very fast moving, taskorengied. Just waking up at the crack of dawn to get the work day before the day starts. Get to work with my co workers that are very nice."
good,I have been with this company for 9 years I have learned and had growth personally and professionally I had met many wonderful individuals on my journey.
good,"Managers ranged from decent to terrible. The job was tedious, boring and forgettable. The coworkers were great, but it didn't make up for the immense cons of the job."
good,it was okay. it was fun with my coworkers. pretty busy during the day. a lot to do and kept working so much. i was constantly tired with little to no breaks.
good,"My husband is a Manager in Alberta and the benefit plan is the most dysfunctional, terrible plan I have ever seen. No one provides any help if you have questions - even getting a copy of the booklet was a nightmare. It's difficult to get answers from Sunlife and the coverage itself is terrible. You can't even get a massage or go to the chiropractor. We were without dental coverage (but still paying) for months because no one told us that you have to contact the union to sign up for dental. "
good,"Just like anywhere most of the customers and other employees are great but there is always a few that are not so great. Its retail so it working late nights, holidays, and weekends."
good,"I had a good time here, the staff is friendly, and everyone got along fairly well I think. The environment was relatively fast-paced. In the starbucks kiosk it was irritating when working alone; no one could leave to retrieve something from the back unless another starbucks clerk was there. This was an issue when it was busy and something ran out of stock."
good,Enjoyed working with the customers at Safeway enjoy working with my co-workers at Safeway and with management enjoy stocking the product it was a nice place to work for
good,"I enjoyed working at safeway a typical day would involve many different tasks, I learned alot about customer service and gained a broad knowledge of many different products, I would say the hardest part about the job was dealing with rude customers and customers that were intoxicated. the most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction i got from helping others, i also enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers."
good,"Safeway is a great shopping center, but as an employee it's a lot of things in a work place that should not be held as a conversation."
good,"great for a first job, very nice staff, not much opportunity for contracts or chance of fulltime employment,great place for school kids wanting to experience their first job,"
good,Full management expectations were not always provided.  I learned to not always proceed without ensuring management was on board.  I learned management was to be provided with a problem along with my suggested solutions.
good,I started at ten in the morning. Go to the store room and got the cages of food to stock the shelves.finished at two in the afternoon.allot of  staff. To many managers for one department.
good,"Working there was a fun experience, I got to meet new people and it was also my first job experience. It made me realize that I had to get my B.Asc because working a minimum wage job is terrible."
good,"Safeway/Albertson is a good place to work. The people are great, and that's probably the best part of working here after almost 6 years. I've developed from working here from a CSR1 to a CSR3."
good,"very calm workplace, had a good time helping costumers and have little chat with them. very good and comfortable environment to work. coworkers are friendly and respectful."
good,There were good and bad things about working for Safeway. It was a union job so a lot of the problems we had were mainly the union and not Safeway itself. It was a great first time job for anyone. Management wasn't very helpful in situations about disagreements. There was a lot of favoritism. The workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was the fact that we were always so busy and under staffed that we never got our full breaks or breaks at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly staff and great customers.
good,Work hard and you will prevail. Work slow and uneducated then stay exactly where you are for years. Find the environment you like in the store and thrive at that portion.
good,"Worked on the night crew of the store (so almost no public interaction at all.)  They were all a bunch of good people"
good,This was an environment that was great with customers and employees were friendly. I would recommend people there to do their daily shopping there everyday.
good,It’s a good place to go and start you work life to get the feelcor a place to go for momentary work while you figure out what you want to do or where you wanna go for work.
good,"Bagged up groceries for customers. Brought carts in from the parking lot, making sure the outside looked clean and clear. Swept the floors so they would be free of spillage."
good,work in safeway give me new opportunities in my life beacuse i just move here from different country and it give me opportunity to deal with different kind of persons and how to deal with persons in a friendly manner give me chance to express my views in front of people
good,Working at Safeway had provided me with great experiences but as my tenor had grow I learned that some of the managers just care about making money and how the business of the store affects their paycheck.
good,"Safeway is a good place to work.  They have helped me work in several different departments and taught me a great deal."
good,"A typical day as a courtesy clerk was pretty fast paced, depending on the day of the week. Doing carts, bagging, helping customers, keeping restrooms cleaned and go backs done. Most everything was common sense, this was my first job, so I didn't really need much training. Management differs store to store, some more strict than others. Hardest part of the job would be doing carts outside in the elements (i.e. rain, snow, wind etc;). Having a workplace family is what made this job nice. Co-workers were incredible."
good,Safeway is an amazing place to work. You must have a business like mindset and be willing to dedicate time to this company to be successful and move up.
good,"Deliver groceries to customer homes and offices"
good,You need to be work fast and be accurate. There is a lot of data entry and can be tedious at times. It takes a little while to understand the process if you never worked in this industry.
good,This was my first job. I enjoyed my time at Safeway. If you are out of high school going into college or in high school right now and need a job this is a good place.
good,A typical grocery store floral department. Friendly employees and customers. Always busy and new products coming in all the time. They are much more interested in numbers on a page than the actual people working in the store.
good,"Other than the 60 days notice of the store closing, one of the best jobs I have ever had. The customers were great and the workers were even better. I will truly miss this job,"
good,One of the places that will take a high school student. I didn't learn much besides cash handling. It wasn't that great of a job. I worked a lot of different departments so that I could pick up hours and the bakery was the best.
good,It’s a good place to work have 401k make good money by order selecting have to be standing lifting always running had to be quick on your feet and fast with your hands
good,I had not once had a set schedule to follow and was worked shifts I said I was not able to resulting in me missing days or having to cancel plans outside of work.
good,"Depending on the area covered by the tech, it can be quite stressful. on call 2 weeks every 3 months covering the Eastern division was complicated at times and took away from family life."
good,"Nice place to work. Early hours. Paid every week. Typical day would be breaking down the load in the order you will work it. Then stock all product on shelves, then order for the next days load. Finally you face the department so everything looks good."
good,"Its a great company to work for, You have the opportunity to move up quickly. The people that work there are amazing to work with. The best part of working there is the benefits, and the people."
good,Would've loved to still be working there unfortunately Some Vons  stores closed down   and ended up in merging with Albertsons .So I along with other co workers ended up leaving the company .
good,"Hardest part of the job is when customers are being ridiculous."
good,I enjoyed my position as a courtesy clerk. and the collaboration of co-workers with exception to a couple of employees who made me feel very uncomfortable when I needed to ask something work related.
good,When I worked there people were always happy. Then we received a new manager and or employees started to leave like wildfire. The new manager was always yelling or down grading you.
good,"Overall, working for Vons is good. They work well with student schedules but it's difficult to move up unless staying with the company is you're ultimate goal. Customers have different types of personalities, just remember to not express irritation or frustration."
good,This job was a good experience for me cause I had this job while I was attending high school ! I started off part time courtesy clerk than ended up being promoted to a checker
good,"I worked at the Pembina & McGillvary location for a couple of months but had done my community practicum there as well. I learned a lot since it was the holiday season and Kroll 10 had just rolled out into our store. All the techs/assistants and pharmacists were awesome, the manager was very accommodating, kind and helpful. Unfortunately I was not technically full time, as they can only have one full-time technician. And that went to the most senior technician. A very decent job experience all the employees outside of the pharmacy were wonderful. The only reason I left was due to school commitments that came up. Would recommend."
good,a typical day is busy at first until customers come in.management is a rare site in departments.its fun knowing your customers through out the years of employment.
good,horrible management horrible pay stressful environment difficult to gain promotions and extremely horrendous health benefits still am fighting to have my daughters birth covered by the joke of insurance plan that was offered
good,Good place to work nice people to work with. Good Benefits. Typical day is fast paced.  Help customers with any questions they may have and support team and managers.
good,"Deli department is fast paced and most of the time stressful, Managment is good for the most part but doesn't let you expland in the store to learn new departments"
good,"It was quite the fast paced environment, which was nice if you have time to get some preparation done.  Thankfully there's usually enough workers there to get it all done."
good,"was a Floor Cashier, assisted customer with ringing up purchases. Cash Handleing experience, Stocked and faced all shelves, candy.  kept all registers full with bags, register tape, cleaned and sanitized belts and scanner"
good,"Management was okay, the work environment was fast and stressful, not all the workers for along, little care for the employees and other workers on site."
good,Safeway was a starting place for someone that just got out of high school . I was there when they were remodeling so that was hard . Helping people to their car when it was raining was not ok . Mgt was not kool at all.
good,This job was very easy if you are quick. Its pretty simple and they do not have you do too much beside scan groceries. If you do well and are a quick learner you can advance and get paid up to $20 to do other jobs
good,"A good unionized job that offers good benefits. Pay and hours could be a bit better, and some managers do need to change how they treat employees, but overall a good workplace to work at."
good,I had a lot of job titles at this location and learned a lot of things there. Management was good to us and we worked hard. We had a lot of promotions and different contests that made the store a fun place to come to work. The pay was good and we had fun.
good,They were a good company to work for at the time but since they have come back under the Albertsons umbrella as Randall's I have nothing recent to compare them to.
good,"Great job for young people, requires a lot of physical work, different type of schedules, you learn a lot about retail and get to interact with different kinds of people. Great opportunity to learn."
good,"Union company. Ensures vacation raises etc all increase in timely manner. All set on a scheduled time frame depending on the starting date, full or part employed"
good,"This fast paced environment was nice because it makes you feel more busy. As a cashier, downtime makes the time pass by so much slower! So I really enjoyed being at such a quick paced location."
good,"Everyday is different, there is always new problems but if you have the right management team, they will help you with it. I think the job  overall is good, not to hard they are not as demanding as other jobs but ii do not think you get paid as well. In order for a company to keep loyal employees they need to take care of them and this company lacks that."
good,"The shifts were always the same, and the Deli had a small staff, so it became easy to guess what my schedule would be like for the upcoming weeks. The only bad part about working at the deli was smelling like the food after work."
good,"Overworking employees is not good for morale. The bakery department has weird hours, making your outside life difficult. Waking up at three, having lunch at 9, and going home at 11am, makes for a weird schedule."
good,"A workplace that you are constantly moving around to do another task, but not overwhelming, more of a keep busy thing. Other employees are kind and friendly, and everyone knows each other. You also get to see everyone and it is the only major store in town, your constantly get to help customers."
good,this is a great job for a first time job seeker. the enviroment was always decent w/cleanliness. my job as a produce clerk was a learn quick an work at a fast pace type.
good,The company was a great place  to work unfortunately despite having good ordering and backup systems it fell into receivership and was sold.  Not much left to say just sorry that it closed
good,I really enjoyed working at Safeway for the most part. It was a friendly and fun place to work and was almost like family when you were there. Everyone was always helpful when I needed help and very welcoming when I started.
good,For a first job this was a great place to work. The experience and training was good and the people I worked with were great. I gained a few skills that I can take with me on to other places.
good,"Safeway is a supermarket where the same customers will come in many times per week, creating familiarity, rapport and a feeling of comfort. For someone who would like to work with familiar faces, it's a good start."
good,"They will always find something for you to do."
good,"Safeway is an outstanding place to work whether you are seeking part time or full time. Unfortunately the pay raises, very shifty schedules and lack of future career opportunities causes many people to leave. Overall a great community!"
good,Safeway is an awesome job for someone who has no responsibilities outside of work and paying bills. Not a job for someone who likes spending time with their family. Pay is great! Lots of hours.
good,Lot of new technologies slowly migrating here. Lot of fun activities and good management. It is great to learn lot of new stuff. Managers are helping to peers.
good,"customer service, competitive pricing, versatile work atmosphere.  Flexible hours.  Good employee support.  Clean stores and large variety of products.."
good,"Safeway provides quality produce and departments while focusing on customer experience. They are exceptional at front end management and friendly, polite."
good,Safeway provided me with a fast paced and exciting workplace. They were quite felixble with my hours and I noticed they worked around my co-workers schedules so they could still attend school.
good,Working at Vons was one of the best jobs because i got to interact with people and also i had alot to do so the time wouldn't really phase me. I got promoted to a new department from courtesy clerk only 2 weeks after being hired.
good,"Interacting with the customers is great. Attention to detail is very important, how the customers like their groceries bagged to how clean the front end of the store is to how many items a person needs when assisting them with getting their groceries."
good,"A day at the floral department was a fun area, get to design different floral arrangements. Sometimes a very slow and other days super busy, especially holidays (Valentine's Day)"
good,Fun and engaging work environment. Very good people that are there to help when needed. The older employees are very helpful to the newer employees. People are positive and fun to be around.
good,"In the 13+ years I was there I made lots of connections and close friends....there IS opportunity , you only need to want to do it."
good,"Bakery is great and managed by a great manager.  Hours are decent, some disagreements and inconsistencies in store management's choices.  Overall, a good place"
good,Safeway was a good job and I was disappointed that my union representative was not helpful in solving the situation that resulted in me losing my job. I feel that profits are more important than employees at times which did lessen the joy of working.
good,"Alright company to work for, very relaxed and laid back. It's a grocery store so there's no sales goals or upselling. Management has to change out end caps every week with promos so that can be a bit tedious."
good,"My first official job out of high school. I feel like everyone needs to go through minimum salary job, and experience giving good customer service to everyone."
good,"During a typical work day, you are constantly working to put the customer first. The work place culture is to respect your co-workers at all times.  The hardest part of the job is, that you may/may complete all of your work assignments during the hours assigned."
good,"A typical day included of taking a look around at the product that needed to be made, then after seeing what needed to be done you would then go ahead and start on the tasks which would include, cuttings of different meats, seasoning of different products, fileting seafood, helping and serving customers etc."
good,"Days at work was great. Everything went smoothly day by day. There was always work to be done whether it was assisting others. I learned a lot of new skill that improved my experience. The workplace was neatly maintained, organized, and filled with kindhearted employee's. The hardest part of the job was changes within the bakery due to new management. The most enjoyable were my co-workers working hard to get our jobs done while having fun at the same time."
good,"5am pull liquor load from back and stock wine beer department. dress down shelves, reorder low inventory, break down cardboard, work all back stock. Price changes 1 x a week."
good,"There are times where we get really busy, and times where it can be really slow, but management can always find something to keep you busy. The other employees are friendly, and the management team provides some fun experiences for the staff. They really try to accommodate time off requests. You're more likely to get as many hours as you want the more availability that you have. If you have restrictions, anyone who has been at the company longer than you has priority as to the shifts that they want to work. The longer you stay at the company, the more consistent your hours will be."
good,I learned how to be a better multi-tasker and improved my customer skills but working holidays at a grocery store Starbucks isn't worth it. Making coffee was an enjoyable skill to lean but i feel stuck and wat to advance.
good,"I would go to work at 2pm and get off at 10pm. I hand 15 minute breaks and an hour for lunch. I would serve customers. I Set up meat, cheese, salad and other deli products for display. It was a very good job. Great people and managers."
good,"Good Co workers, good customers most of the time, clean store, quick to pick up on the jobs training, but did not like the politics. To much paperwork but not enough time to do all they required to get done in a shift."
good,"Overall, it's a great first job for teens and beneficial to employees who have been there for awhile. This work place is great for teens still in high school due to scheduling and gaining work experience."
good,I enjoyed my work career at Safeway. One really great thing about working with this company is that they will cross train you in all departments. They want to see you do good and grow. The union scale does make it hard and seem long to get pay raises.
good,Responsibilities was to clean oven to pack freezer also to unpack delivery trucks and 2Pac the deli Isles all tools to serve customers on a 4-Hour basis of myself in the deli
good,man it was fun an i got overtime an was having a goo time working thre i enjoyed the flexibility an everyone was friendly an i worked with  food so even better
good,"Safeway has a lot of good qualities as a company. They stay competitive and try to manage their money well."
good,I started out doing courtesy clerk.....from there I was moved to the bakery......the bakery was ok except for how it was run......the work and the deadlines where lacking in the common sense department
good,excellent place to work learned how to do everthing to the front of the store to the back and the deli and the bakery. Loved it. The location was awesome
good,"It was my duty to train my staff to act in accordance with sales, service and profit. This starts with putting out quality product day in and day out."
good,"The most important take-away from this job was the knowledge i gained from on-the-job experience. What each prescription does, and how prescription insurance actually works, is knowledge I am thankful to have."
good,"Fun place to work, enjoyed my time with them. No way to advance by working hard or being good at your job. Job advancement goes to anyone who started before you."
good,"typical day at work when the stock are out."
good,"was a great group of people there who have yet to be used to their full potential. The right person to tap the culture, the knowledge and their experiences that already exist in a great company, will usher Safeway into the 22nd century with ease"
good,This role was my first serious insight into retail.  I started this role part time collecting trolleys before progressing into the ambient side of the store
good,"Hired as a Phlebotomy Supervisor but Safeway cancelled the program.  I was asked to stay on and they would pay for my training as a Pharmacy Technician.  I was able to complete the course and obtain my Pharmacy Technician certificate in California.  I was then sent to the Corporate laboratory for employees and worked their until I left Safeway.  I ran the laboratory and did all of the blood draws for the employees and their families.  This included children and infants.  I processed all of the specimens as well.  "
good,Overall I would say that it is a good place to work.  I just did not have a good manager. He was not at all flexible when asked to accommodate necessary changes in my work schedule.
good,My time at Safeway was fun and easy to manage as long as I stayed on task and didn't get behind on my work. The experience there was really helpful on learning how fast paced things can get during work hours.
good,I enjoyed working for Safeway it is the same as any grocery store just different prices  the manager were great the employees were awesome I made some good friends
good,Safeway Deli offers staff a busy workplace environment and develops customer service skills. You will learn quickly how to handle various situations and how to think quick on your feet.
good,Retail pharmacy was a new environment for me at the time but I enjoyed working at Safeway.  The pharmacy technicians were very nice and helpful in the busy environment.
good,I would say that this job was definitely temporary for me. I remember it was fast paced and competitive. I did not really care much for this job. I would rate it good though.
good,"I didn't work there long and other than management, People were pretty friendly. I know that management has a lot on their plate and it can be stressful at times, so they weren't that horrible. just not as friendly as everyone else was"
good,"I went to work at 3:00 A. M., that was a challenge, I learned how to stock merchandise Safeway's way.  The management was great and so was the work culture.  The hardest part was waking up at that time to go to work.."
good,"Hours vary every week. One week you could be working 35, the next you could be working 15. It all depends on the sales for the store. I personally don't like having a steady amount of hours every week."
good,Working at the Starbucks there was a lot of fun. I generally loved the customers and the fast-paced work environment. Management was a little strict but tolerable.
good,"The Safeway was an alright place to work. The people around me were cool to work with. But anytime something would happen that was out of someone control the management still blamed the person. No matter what it was, they were never understanding"
good,"Good place to work, they have different hours and departments to work in. I have worked there for 33 yrs. It has been a good place to work but it is time for a change."
good,"A typical workday consisted of baking, packaging, helping customers, cleaning, decorating cakes, taking orders, making labels, slicing bread, facing the bread wall and taking out the trash."
good,Safeway is a great company to be employed you are protected under the Union and they have great benefit package. They have various activities and scholarships for their employees and their families
good,"a set of tasks to complete"
good,"I enjoyed my work, my managers, and our patients that came to our pharmacy.  Everyday was a new and fun challenge, even through some of the most mundane tasks.  I would work with them again."
good,A typical work day was very stressful and busy. I worked at the busiest meat department Vons had in that area and often we were understaffed. My department managers and supervisors were always great and worked around my school schedule. I learned lots of valuable skills working in that department.
good,"Has been a good job for me I have worked for the company for almost 19 years and in that time was able to do various jobs. "
good,"Overall the work was good, coworkers were friendly and i was able to know and recognize every face even to this day when i'm shopping there whether a former coworker or customer i helped. Management was awful there though at the time i was working there. I was verbally abused and always felt like a failure and like i was not good enough and would be in tears after almost every shift so, i eventually resigned because i couldn't take it anymore."
good,"This was a job I worked at right after I finished high school. "
good,"I had a great team in the Deli department but the store manager had a bone to pick with the department always, no matter how good things were going, or how nice the department was kept. He would go off on us if we didn't recieve enough product even when it was out of our control. There was also some serious sexism issues in the store I worked for."
good,Some days challenging some days rewarding. Hard company to work for like you own it as requested. No connect between employees and managment. High employee turnonver makes it hard to create a strong managable team.
good,"Good pay, but didn't keep us scheduled for 40 hours like what was told we would be."
good,"It was fun but it's hard to juggle work and school. I did my best and gave up the job to begin job corps. the people were cool and i enjoyed the work place, nothing dull at all."
good,"After getting the proper training I was able to run the floral department on my own.  Ordering, cleaning, designing."
good,"After paying initial union dues compensation is quite good, so are the health benefits associated with being a part of the UFCW. Hour can be irregular which is tough on family life."
good,"Very high paced with lots of customer interaction. If you are bored in the deli, you are not working hard enough, there is always something to be doing there. Co-workers were great. Store management was good."
good,This company has great benefits and is a fun place to work. They however do not like to take into consideration the lives of their workers. They are not willing to work with your schedule if it does not suit them.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Safeway but only as a means to pay rent and school, I wouldn't make it a full time career. But a good part time job for that extra money in the pocket."
good,I have worked at Safeway for a little over a month as an order selector. While my time their has been short i have learned a lot and would greatly recommend a Safeway job to any of my friends or family.
good,"-Can get crazy depending on the department you are in"
good,"I started working here very recently, and have enjoyed it thusfar. However, my new manager had told me, the last day I had worked (almost a full week ago now) that she would call me when she got my schedule figured out. I have heard no word, the online schedule has not been updated, and I can't seem to get in contact with her."
good,"a warehouse culture in a grocury warehouse. great wage per hour, physically demanding work at times but also keeps you physically fit. days go by quickly the quicker you work"
good,"You will work every single second of every day that you are scheduled. It was very busy most of the time, and neither customers nor management are very appreciative of the work you do. There is never enough time in a work day to get done everything that needs to be done."
good,This is a company that is state wide and that cares for everyone that works there.  The employer helps the employee when ever they can.  This company is a company that i would work for again.
good,The things that are the bad part is you dont have set schedule and you can be working from 3 to 1130 and come back at 7 quiet often. Also management aren't the best at managing.
good,safeway was a great workplace but management at that store was not very well set up i guess you could say. it was productive and stuff got done but it was a little chaos like.
good,I started out as a courtesy clerk then I was promoted to become a cashier were I took payment from the customer and I also stock the store. I also was promoted again to the fuel station.
good,"is a great place to work and also has great benefits and an awesome environment would refer anyone to come and work for them. a typical day would inquire you setting up the deli, getting foods started and staying on the right pace"
good,"My experience as a cashier at Safeway was always a learning experience. Everyday working for the company was never dull there's something new you can pickup just by working there. The employee's are always so kind and nice towards each other, almost like a family relationship. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers with their items at the till. They always threat me with respect and kindness."
good,"Safeway Inc. is a fun and efficient place. The employees are united, "
good,"Safeway is a fantastic place to get you motivated to achieve more in your life. They have an excellent staff, and consistently push you. If you can keep up then you can achieve great things"
good,"Not much to say about this one, it was a job. you did what you were told and that was the end of it. Overall it wasn't bad and if it came down to it, I'd return."
good,"I was always on time for work. this job is located in Lexington, ms . the management was sometimes difficult but through all of that I still managed to get my job done."
good,"this was my first job and i have no real complaints, i learned many of my customer service skills by starting off as a cashier. the downside is that you are required to be a union member in order to work for the company, my dues as a cashier were $50 a month just to have a job!!!"
good,"Great place to work, though no consistency with schedule.  New employees contracts are very different from the older contracts and seem unfair. Management was firm but fair."
good,You are on your feet all day and have a 30 min break. Monotonous work and repetitive. The days were very long and sometimes the hours were a little unreasonable. It was very hard to get time off.
good,"A typical workday included seeing many friendly faces, and assisting with many grateful customers. I acquired better communication skills while working for this company. Management was very helpful, and understanding of my scheduling needs, and always tried to grant me the days I requested off. Working at Safeway, there was a friendly feeling to the environment. As with most jobs, it was difficult to deal with stubborn customers, but there was always someone to lend a hand. The managers treated us with respect, and treated us like adults, even just as high school students. I enjoyed working for this company, and if I needed to, I would work for them again."
good,"it is a great place to start a professional career. It was my first job and will hold a place in my heart. Management is nice, people call out alot so there's always ways to get extra hours."
good,"A good place to work at, not the best place if you don't like to stand for 8 hours a day doing many projects. Management is not set as good as it use to but still a good place to work."
good,"Safeway, Inc. is an American supermarket chain founded in 1915. It is a subsidiary of Albertsons, having been acquired by private equity investors led by Cerberus Capital Management in January 2015."
good,"A typical work day for me is coming in on time , making sure i have everything i would need for that day. serving my customers and making sure they leave happy and got what they came for. I have learned that with time you will make mistakes but you learn from them. I enjoy everything about my job."
good,"Management was alright. A typical day included stocking shelves and bagging groceries and helping customers outside to their cars. Work place attitude could have been better. A lot of people with unique back grounds. All in all, not a bad place to work but morale was kinda low."
good,"Very fast paced job, i learned that your attitude has a lot of effect on your customers,the only problem with management was they did not honor availability for they're employees well at this establishment, the overall workplace had a very good vibe, overall hardest part of the job was learning the drinks at first, working with people i loved working with people and providing good customer service."
good,It was my first job so I thought it to be hard. Some days weren't bad but there was always something to do. The staff overall were friendly and professional.
good,It was a good first job for me. It was an easy way for me to get money. I just had to bag groceries and sweep the store and do other things that a clerk would do at Safeway. The management was fine and it was an overall satisfying job.
good,"Work is work. Its good employee's and a good environment to be around. Could just some management improvement, or better raining other than that its all good."
good,typical day was busy.  i learned how to work alone or in a group.  managment was good.  the culture was nonexistent.  hardest part was working alone. best part was getting to know the regulars.
good,A typical day at work is very crowded. Employees working as hard as possible to keep the store in order and customers satisfied. The co-worker environment is welcoming and friendly.
good,"Safeway also has lots of opportunities to advance and see customer service and retail through more than one perspective. There is a lot of responsibility that comes working here, but it is rewarding and the people there are all fantastic."
good,safeway is a wonderful job for a first job. I learned better people skills and communication skills and how to deal with customers. I worked with friendly and helpful coworkers and they made it easier to do my job right while  also helping with anything I needed.
good,"Everywhere you walked there was a friendly face or somebody to greet you. Scheduling was great do to major flexibility for hours."
good,I worked there for 5 years and was constantly working swing shifts and found it very hard to advance.  The only promotion I ever got was to a night shift stocking position that made my life miserable as I am not a night person.  That is ultimately caused me to leave the company.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Safeway. The work was rewarding and I learned a great deal. I became a ""Fruit Ninja"" working with this company! I miss working in the restaurant industry and the interaction of sales, customers, service and fresh, hot food, so it is with regret I leave my team of co-workers. I highly recommend working here"
good,"Safeway is a wonderful job for a first job."
good,"typical day was a slow but productive day, ill would get things done in a timely fashion. the management was good no complaints, there were no hard part about this job."
good,"Not very flexible with hours for student employees. A good introduction to customer service. Hardest part of the job comes around when you are understaffed and are expected to close the store or open the store by yourself, which happens more often than you would hope."
good,mornings were the best and baking was fun  good vibes all the way around but co workers could get a bit too comfortable overall i would say if you are a fast learner and quick on your feet good common sense you would have no troubles here
good,"If you work hard, have good attendance and a positive attitude, you will go far and get more hours of work. If they call you out of the blue on your day off to come in to work - don't refuse - say: ""yes no problem I will be there."" (if you can, of course)."
good,I love the great customer service of the employees...I love how the deli is food always fresh i know from being able to work in the deli I love helping and talking to customers
good,It is a well-diverse community. It is a good place to work in because the co-workers there are able to provide constructive opinions about your ideas and build your ideas. There is always room for growth.
good,At Safeway I was the lead cashier. I rung up groceries and handled cash. I answered telephone calls when needed. I supervised other cashiers that were on the floor. Make sure they received their breaks etc.
good,"A typical day at work for me was when I got there to clock in and began work. When the customers arrived to the register I greet them in a friendly manner and began scanning items. I also handled cash,coupons, gift cards and credit and bagged their items."
good,Great place to work and have opportunity to move up within. I learned a lot on my own instead of being trained. I had some issues with management and not communicating to me but I still got through and figured out what I didn't know and needed to.
good,good part time job with good coworkers and management. Day to day operations were easy to get the hang of which made it easy to get good at
good,The people were nice didn't really get a chance to talk to them because we were so busy working. Overall the job was a good paying job I wish I was still working there.
good,Very fast pace.   Productive and enjoy meeting many clients.  It has flexible hours to help those still in school.   They work around school schedules.
good,"I learned that the only people who matter to that company are the people who have been there for a few years. I was not trained properly had no idea how to check my schedule and no idea where anything in the store was (restroom, break room, etc) had to find it on my own. the managers weren't very pleasant to deal with either.but my fellow employees (cashiers) were rather kind and tried to help me as much as they can."
good,I learned a lot with this company. I'm willing to learn and get what I can to make growth. I met so many fun people customers and co workers.I learned how to manage my money.
good,"Typical day at work was setting up display and preparing self serve cases and cleaning. Helping customers and being good with customer service is essential.  the people at this particular store in the seafood / meat department are top notch, quality people to work with.  about an hour before close you take down display and sweep, mop the area and clean and sanitize. Never needing to work passed 6pm was very pleasing for work / life balance."
good,Safeway was my first job and though I refused to work there at first it open a lot of doors for me. A great place to develop skills in various types of environment.
good,Good place to start and acquire skills. With a union backing up the work force you can guarantee in having an honest workplace.
good,"Managing department inventory, in-stock position, pricing integrity, merchandising, labor, and other operational processes of the Deli Department according to company standards. Supervising Deli Department employees, and ensures proper training, correct ordering, receiving, unloading, storage, rotation of merchandise, and building of displays. Greets and interacts with customers to provide exceptional service in a casual and professional environment."
good,"Good career advancement opportunities"
good,"I enjoy working knowing i am with good people around and i find it very rewarding to meet customers and assist them with satisfaction.The Management i work with are all team player, very compassionate and professional individuals. Treatment was fair and judgment on all cases are based on facts and governed by policies. The hardest part of my work is when employee/s assigned to work suddenly don't come to work and we have to work for their work or injure too much lifting and bending as things has to be done right away."
good,This is the position I worked spent the longest time.  Always challenging and interesting.  The best part is being able to manage your own scheduling in order to meet your labor budget.
good,"I learned customer service, loss prevention, and product placement. The management was good, always tried to accommodate around my schedule for school and etc. My co-workers were a fun bunch of people who loved to help customers to the best of their ability and tried to make the store a place that you wanted to work and shop. I would say the hardest part of my job at Safeway was multi-tasking, wile the most enjoyable part of my job was helping people with special shop."
good,"Worked in cold enviroment, sort lunches, same thing day in and day out. Not a fun plave to work at, but great pay. Have to work swing shift, and build knowledge of use of electric pallet jack."
good,"A typical day at work would be to clean, and bag."
good,Safeway is always changing and helps to keep you motivated to move along with the changes. The pay and benefits are really nice and the employees are very friendly. It is a family environment that has many chances to move up within the company
good,"Nice friendly staff, sometimes long hours as shop was open late. nice customers was glad to serve them, learnt lots ov different skills"
good,Customers are friendly. Coworkers are easy to get along with. Management is a little harder to befriend. The hardest part of the job is standing in one spot for 8 hours.
good,It was an experience working here. People I worked with were awesome as well as management. I lived to far and didn't make enough money to stay that long.
good,"The management is very poor where I work. There very disorganized."
good,"Working at Safeway was a great opportunity.  It gave me the skills to be able to work with customers one on one.  I enjoyed getting to know my regular customers that came in all the time.  Working in the different departments was fun, such as floral, bakery, customer service desk and fuel station."
good,It was a job that I needed at the time although I would never become a lifer there. I put in hard working hours every day and tried to not get in people's way but all I got was yelled at.
good,Great place to start a job and to learn different aspects of a grocery environment.  providing an atmosphere for customers to want to come back and shop and order special items.  the constant changing of management and coworkers can get hard to deal with when you adjust to one style and the have to change with no notice.
good,very organized very busy. for the most part i felt listened to. pretty laid back for the most part. very consistent hours i always know i'm going to at least have 25 hours a week which is nice.
good,"Working at Safeway taught me alot about working as a team, also help me learn how to deal with angry customers in a profeesional manner."
good,"helped get me day to day with minimum conflict, people I worked with were good people enjoyed working with all my co workers"
good,"The Safeway located in Foster City has great and dedicated employees and management. I was taken care of and cared about at work, and I really enjoyed being around my coworkers. As a Courtesy Clerk, I bagged, collected carts, cleaned, put things away, and helped customers find what they were looking for. I did not like working till midnight two nights in a row, especially since I was in school. It was also hard having required Union dues taken out of my check each week. Overall, Safeway is a reliable store with great employees."
good,I liked how there were plenty of opportunities to move up within the company. Although this was a much more strict work environment they still treated their employees with a tremendous amount of respect.
good,"Very flexible   good culture  good pay"
good,"Good, manager were friendly and helpful. It was hard with being in different area though they always provided good information."
good,"I worked at night when it was quiet, and there wasn't any customers which was my preference at the time. I would see how fast I could memorize where everything was then see how fast I could stock the product. My co-workers would have competitions to see how many pieces we could do a minute! Once you're shown what to do and how to do it you're left alone to do the best you can and I absolutely loved that!"
good,"Der vielbesuchte Safeway im Bow Valley macht den hoechsten Umsatz, da auch sehr viele Touristen, die durch das Valley fahren und die zahlreichen Spitzensportler, die in dem Olympiaort Canmore trainieren, dort einkaufen. Das Warenangebot reflektiert das internationale, sehr auf Gesundheit achtende Publikum."
good,A great stepping stone for getting back into the work force.  I appreciated the fast paced environment and the value of giving superior customer service.
good,Safeway was a position that requires an individual to be courteous and polite to customers.  You had to be willing to be on your feet and move quickly at all times during your shift.  The people are friendly and willing to help other employees with their busy schedules.  A good position for someone who is looking for a part-time position.
good,I was able to handle a high volume of calls and emails per day.  I was supervisor in charge when our superior was out of the office and I also answered questions from fellow agents.  I was able to learn how to multi-task in a high call volume environment and also how to be a great problem solver.  Managers were always eager to help when available.
good,"My day revolves around stocking and organizing freight. I assist customers whenever it is required providing them with a friendly and helpful experience. There really is not much to learn other then the ordering schedules and how to scan bar codes. The management is fair, they could communicate a little better, once I realized this was a weakness of theirs I made it a point to keep myself informed as not to fail in my tasking or allow management to fail in theirs. My coworkers are helpful when they can be and pleasant to work with. The hardest part of this job would be the minimum freight we are required to handle in a shift. I do as instructed, and meet the minimum require though I would prefer if it was slightly less as I prefer quality of work over quantity. The most enjoyable part of this job as a manager I have control of my own department."
good,"My days at work always consisted of working with customers and helping them find product they're needing, typically for that same day. I learned to compensate for items we may not have in stock by my product knowledge and ability to give reviews. My management changes every few months which teaches you a lot about how affectively your work place is being maintained. My coworkers and I always built a strong bond through communication and learning that work can also be enjoyable. The hardest part of my job was negative customers coming through the door but this is also a great opportunity to build a connection and have them leaving feeling satisfied and confident in there purchases. My job was in enjoyable in the aspect that I got to work in most departments and because I learn quickly got to utilize all of my skills."
good,"A typical day at Safeway was starting your shift as you relieved the other cashier. You worked for 2 hours then got your first 15 minute break, though sometimes it could differ a bit and you might have to wait up to an extra 30 minutes before you got your break. Lunch was a half hour break usually would depend on the order of when who started, people who started at 8 am went first obviously. The last 15 minute break was around 2 hours after lunch. During the day you would simply put customers through your till in a polite and fast way. When you had no customers you would tidy up your till area and organize the front of shelf's in front of your till."
good,"Being employed at Safeway in Kihei, Hawaii I can say we always see to it that we provide best custmer service.  With the Aloha spirit at the island you'll know you'll experience excellent service which some of our custumers never or rather experienced it for the first time.  It's always inspiring to work knowing you have great customer satisfactions."
good,"My day starts with doing a store walk, making sure all the departments are prepare for their day, everybody is doing their jobs. Throughout the day i help customers and employee's with their needs, i also do schedule, payroll, and book work. i have really good work environment. and even in future i want to work in fun, loving environment.  working in retail the day can be fun or  hectic it just depends on the people we deal with in our day.  All over it's a great working environment."
good,"I usually worked the night shift, which required me to fulfill customer orders until 10:00pm.  It is also my responsibility to clean the deli counter to sanitation standards.  It is also my responsibility to work on production and make sure the sales floor around the deli department is filled with a variety of products for customers."
good,"Typical Day Routine: Starting my shift for the day I would clock in and proceed to check-out lanes in the front of the store to great customers while I bag their items in an orderly fashion in the bags of their choosing. Once I have asked them if they would like my assistance to take their bags to and in their vehicle (with a typical reply being ""no""), I would then move to another check-out lane to help bag. During the slow hours I would bag up to three different check-out lanes at a time to help get the customer have a fast check-out experience. Once it was time to sweep the store's floor (which was about 20 after every hour), I would walk around the store to pick up any large trash and to spot any liquid spills. Then I would proceed to the broom and finish my sweep. After I had swept the items from the broom and dumped them into the trash, I would then get the mop container and fill it up with hot soapy water. I took the mop container and the mop to the bathrooms and clean the floor after using chemicals to clean the mirrors, toilets, sinks, trash bins, and paper towel dispensers. I then would stock the bathrooms with anything that is empty. Once emptying the rinsing the mop container and the mop I would wash my hands, ""punch-in"" the sweep, and call the sweep over the intercom to the other employees knew that it got done as well as document the sweep on the form next to the phone. On my way back to the check-out lanes I would see if the shopping carts needed to be brought back in the store, if so I would put on the safety vest and gloves to retrieve the carts. After that has"
good,"A typical day ranges from a 4-8.5 hour shift. As a courtesy I am responsible for the customer's satisfaction in all departments during their shopping experience. It's my duty to keep the store clean and well stocked for those two things tend to make the customer happy. "
good,Overtime! lots of hours and never enough people to take up the slack. this made pay day nice but exhaustion high. there was a lot of skill building right out of the gate and customer service was on top of the list. management was nice but had trouble covering in an emergency and were not always helpful.
good,What we did packed baked goods listen to gossip helped customers learned to write on cakes and cleaned the store. Good management for the most. Would go back again just not in the bakery
good,"started the day by loading my box truck with totes which had customers groceries in them, and would follow my manifest making morning deliveries, come back for lunch and unload empty totes, refill truck for an evening route."
good,"Team work is the main factor into getting any job done. With the help of management and my team members I was able to not only work and obtain new knowledge withing every department at my store (bakery, service deli, checker, customer service, accountant etc) I was able to climb the ladder into management myself. Here I gained the knowledge and work ethic of a leader and was able to be an example as well as a person to look up to within my team. This company has many departments and positions young adults as well as mature adults could succeed within. A positive outlook and hour availability is a must along with very strong customer service and  social skills."
good,overall environment of the store was always great employees and management got along well. the upper management had unrealistic ideas but other then that it was a great company to work for
good,"This was a good place to learn different cuts of meat, information regarding fish, and learning new skills (filleting salmon). "
good,"This is my first job here in America and it taught me a lot of things when it comes to work and I enjoyed it a lot because i got to do what i love to do. I just need to have some career advancement but overall, i had enjoyed working with the management and my co-workers."
good,This was a great company to work for.  Unfortunately it was sold to a larger corporation and the culture changed.  At the time the sale was taking place I was leaving to relocate to another state.
good,"I made friends right away with my co-workers, everyone was friendly. The job wasn't too hard, kept me on my feet all day though. Fair breaks and long lunch. I enjoyed my time working at Vons in Big Bear."
good,"I learned to be confident. I learned to be more outgoing, I learned that I can be a leader. I learned how to quickly problem solve. I learned how to build friendships. I learned that it's important to listen and follow instruction. I learned how to use a register and I learned product codes, how to operate a hand jack, package products, price products and pull price tags. I learned how to prepare different foods. I learned how to take phone orders, I learned how to break down load and face product. I also learned how to write on and decorate cakes."
good,It's a good job if you looking for a part-time job.Supportive management varies on store location. We stay busy which is plus but sometimes can be too much cause we're always short on staff.
good,"I loved this job at first and was told there was always room to move up the ladder, not only in position but also in pay, that was short lived and as the recession hit everything about the company changed. I had great relations with everyone, including the customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that I was offering a service that was second to none and very well appreciated. alot of the customers could not drive and really needed this service and the great customer service. the hardest part of the job was my schedule and the fact that I wanted to attend school but was told if I did, I would lose my benefits. The job was very demanding at times and lots of stress was involved, but dealt with efficiently. Management was all over the place and constantly changing around."
good,A typical day at work was basically restocking selves while being a cashier. The management was very great the were able to give me shift around my school. My co-workers were supportive and friendly. Most enjoyable part of my job was meeting costumers and interacting with them everyday. I was able to help them when the struggle finding and item around the store.
good,"If you are just starting out in your life as an adult, Safeway is a good place to start. You get to meet a lot of really nice people, but you will deal with a lot of terrible people as well. Management sucks, and a lot of times there will be times when from 6 PM to midnight they will only have one courtesy working."
good,"I was a bagger at Safeway.  Helped customers with their food, maintained the store, restocked, and brought in the carts."
good,"Enjoy working at Safeway. Very accommodating to my schedule."
good,"Great place to work."
good,"It was my job to set up the seafood case, give excellent customer service and package food and check for freshness. It was also my job to make sure everything was sanitized and cleaned. The hardest part was that i disliked seafood."
good,I loved working with families. I have volunteered/worked in a  church setting with students and families going on 8 years. A day of work usually consisted of administrative work planning events and lessons for the students. Sometimes this would be delayed for the sake of investing in a students personal life and taking them for some hang out time. I enjoyed seeing students growing and living out the things we would teach them as I worked with 1-2 parent volunteers who assisted in teaching students. The hardest part of my job was time management as i worked another job on top of this job and went to school.
good,"Large fast pace corporation with demanding deadlines."
good,"Great job. Learned a lot from my department manager. Taught me a few things such as ordering, scheduling and counting inventory. Hardest part of the job was that i always had to do extra for other departments."
good,"This was my favourite job so far."
good,"I love that Safeway prides itself on customer service. I think of myself as a customer before an employee. I enjoy my co-workers and management staff. The pay compensation is awful for the work you put in. Being Customer Service, you're salary caps out at $11.95 which is no where near an appropriate cost of living can fulfill. I've been there for over 2 years with still no raise."
good,"The Analyst role is often a hybrid role and you are also managing a category within the National Safeway Stores. Your responsibilities as a buyer are to partner with the category captain, understand industry trends, analyze and make decisions for the category."
good,"My review about this job was great, the only thing i sometimes closed late at night, but overall it was a great job. The reason I stopped working there was due that it was a smaller Safeway so they moved to a bigger building. I had a great time & great co-workers as well."
good,This was my first job and it was a good place to work. The flexibility was good. I learned a lot here about customer service and how to exceed customers expectations every day.
good,"A position of cashier in the front end of the store was very fast paced with many opportunities to provide excellent customer service to repeat and new customers.  I learned that customers want to experience total satisfaction when spending their hard hard earned money, and that customer service was a huge part of that satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and the fact some customers would purposely enter my lane for checkout because they appreciated the fast, accurate and courteous service received from me on a regular basis."
good,"Like the life balanced style culture.  Able to perform my job, advance in my academic education, and take care of my family."
good,"nice place to work not to many opportunities, you have a nice managers and crew to work with. customers are somewhat friendly"
good,Working at Safeway Foods was a good experience for me. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and for. It was a great learning experience.
good,I enjoy my job.  I have a good crew and a good store manager the work is demanding but when you like your job it makes it easier to do.  The recent merger is a little strain on everybody.  I believe in time it will all work its self out.
good,"In my time with safeway I liked how simple the work was for the money but the kind of people and attitudes the grocery industry attracts are not positive or ideal to work with for many years. dude to gas prices and otherthings operations are expensive so safeway cuts corners where it can to save money, meaning your hours and never the supplies you need. . . does pay well after a few years."
good,"Safeway is a good company with lots of opportunity for future advancement. I worked there for 13 years as a Supply Chain Analyst/Buyer/Purchasing Agent. It was a wonderful place with several career opportunities due to my hard work and dedication. The people were positive and re-inforced a great customer service oriented approach."""
good,My duties included running a in store kiosk that pertained to the Safeway club card imitative. Their i learned great Customer Service skills. Management in the stores were great. co-workers were always pleasant and courteous. Their was no hard aspect of this job.The enjoyable part was interacting  with the customers .
good,"Primarily worked in large retail produce department but also involved in all facets of a large retail outlet (cashier, customer service, stocking etc.)"
good,I would retrieve carts and baskets and put them in their proper places. I would clean the bathrooms and the store. I would help when the bottle machines would stop working or wouldn't accept bottles or cans. I would help bag groceries.
good,"- Very busy throughout the day"
good,"After balancing the books, I assisted customers in varied ways such as locating products, product knowledge etc. Being positive and attentive is key, with management, fellow employees and customers. The challenge was the ever present need to be in more than one place at a time and the most enjoyable was meeting all needs of customers in a creative way."
good,"A good place to work, learned a lot of valuable things that I will take to every employer I have. Some of the people made it a fun place to work"
good,i enjoyed working there while i was going to school but the manager was way too strict when it came to certain things but overall enjoyed it
good,Management here is not on top of employees.  There are many people who wander all day and are not reprimanded at all. A typical day at work consists of dealing with irate customers who management does not want to deal with so they pawn it off on the employees
good,loved work but with baseball schedule at time couldn't continue working there. work was fun and I really enjoyed working there for the short amount of time I did.
good,Store level is secure. Backstage is not secure and frustrating due to inefficient practices and being run by bean counters.
good,"A typical day working for Safeway entails; I get to work and I just jump right in. I say it like that because there was just no other words for it. I began work there when they had bought out another local pharmacy and the place was extremely busy. I'd work the register, answer phones, talk to doctors, help patients, put away and make the orders and organize the constant mess there just always seemed to be etc. . The management was extremely nice and so were my co workers. All of us were put under an extreme amount of stress and pressure but we just always worked through it and helped each other out in any way we could. I really enjoyed the customers and people I worked with."
good,"Overall, working at Safeway as a Courtesy Clerk was fun, I didn't quite feel comfortable with management. The managers were terrible at their job, they would have a negative attitude towards employees and customers making me and everyone else uncomfortable."
good,Good place to work. The staff were friendly and helpful. i got on with them well. the hours were alright. i learned how to use a handheld scanner and use electronic picktruck
good,Start the day off with safety meetings then agenda meetings. Then loading trucks with equipment for jobs. What I learned is anything commercial or Industrial construction is lots of paper work and meetings.  with all jobs you have hard working co-workers and lazy ones. hardest part of job was getting job done in aloted hours we had to finish with out going over. making sure my crew was working and not just milking hours. Traveling was best part of job
good,"Productive and fun work place with fun and friendly customers and employees.Hardest part cash control.Management,stricked kept you on your toes.I learned how to have fun at work."

good,"The job was just like any other corporate job, where you would sit in a desk seat from 7-4pm and couldn't wait to go home. I will give them the benefit that they finally decided to let everyone wear jeans and listed to music while working, but still doesn't beat some other jobs I have had in a similar position."

good,"Working as a cashier for Safeway is an excellent position. I have been able to hone my customer service skills, working on the front lines. As we have just updated our register systems, it has given everyone the opportunity to learn new things and to more efficiently assist customers. Management and Co workers are pleasant and friendly. The hardest part of being a cashier is the physicality of the position. You are constantly lifting and moving groceries, and standing for long periods can become difficult. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing returning customers and developing a relationship with them. After a while, you get customers who look for you at the checkstand and are willing to wait for you. Working as a front end cashier is a great way to serve people, and you never have the same day twice."

Management ways always good with keeping their work force wanting to do better.  The co-workers were good characters.

good,"The team of people I worked with at Safeway were excellent.  We had little to no problems dividing up work to conquer it as individuals when needed or coming to together to get it done.  The management in the Pharmacy was good at delegating tasks when needed and allowing us room to work.  We filled an average of 100-150 prescriptions a day and had an extensive list of bubble pack patients.  The hardest part of the job was balancing phone calls, prescription filling and patient interaction when it was busy or we were short staffed, but this is where we really came together and cooperated.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the interactions with some of the regulars that you build up a relationship with and entering/filling prescriptions."
good,I worked at Safeway for two years and I was able to explore the different jobs offered by Safeway
good,"A typical day at work contains many different jobs. It may contain any of the following; day stocking, customer service, book keeping(opening and closing), checking, etc. I'm in the path of management, so learning as much as I can of how to run a store is a everyday task. I work extremely well with my co workers, and try to help out everybody as much as possible. I always like to give a helping hand. The hardest part of my job is probably handling angry and upset customers, even though they leave happy. The most enjoyable part is, on the other hand, working with the public. I am very much a people person, and enjoy meeting and working with new people."

good,While working at Safeway I had worked flexible hours while attending school. My daily tasks included assistance of cashiers and assisting those who asked with their purchases. Other than the main priority I stocked items and maintain appearance of the work environment. Each day I had organized the many products provide by Safeway and cleaned common areas used by workers and customers. During the time of multitasking confused customers asked many questions and I help provide them with confident answers. Being a new courtesy clerk was sometimes hard as customers had questioned me about things above my authority. I found it very helpful that my co-workers were able to help me during the beginning.

I grab my keys and go inspect the work vehicle I will use for the day and prepare myself for the day and anything it might bring, random weather included.  Being that I've been there for some years I've been around for easy and hard days.  Hard days being heavy item orders with lots of stairs and no parking; easy days are all deliveries are near each other and no stairs or have an elevator.  The operations manager, my boss, is nice and fair.  She is friendly and approachable so if there is any concerns I may have I can being them to her.  One of the things I really enjoy is that I am on my own managing myself making sure that I get my job done.  Being able to be in the field is nice, I enjoy interacting with people so passing other delivery men/women, customers, or just a person on the street are all interactions I benefit from.  My co-workers are pretty great.  I've been able to build some really good relationships with new and old employees.  Everyone is really nice and helpful.

good,"I usually just went to my till at work and rung through customers, as well as solved their problems and answered any questions they had all in a patient and calm manner. I learned how to be more patient, calm and relaxed under pressure. Management was varied at times depending on who was on shift. I had some amazingly kind and understandable managers, a few others not so much. My co-workers were great people, a lot of them I still talk to today. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude people and sometimes closing shifts. The best part was getting to meet some great people, co-workers and customers."
good,"A friendly hospitable environment."

The hardest part about this job was that it was located in a big city resulting it being a very busy place.

I got along fine with management because I believe that when I'm at work, I'm there to work. I performed every function of the job to the best of my ability, even if it was to go outside and gather carts. Management respected that about me, and I respected their authority. My co-workers at Safeway were probably the best part of my job. I worked at several different stores, and each crew that I worked with was great.

good,"Safeway was very enjoyable and it taught me so much about customer service, cash handling and multitasking"
good,Tipical day at work starts with the new palets of fruits and vegetables. Co-workers and Management are great and reliable workers.
good,"This was my first experience working in a retail pharmacy. I learned a lot about the process of filling prescriptions, resolving insurance and patient problems, working with technicians, pharmacist duties and legal responsibilities."
good,Being a cashier is fun because of the interaction with the customers. You see the same people everyday and you get to know them. The problem is that time goes by slow and your legs get sore from all the standing. The medical benefits are excellent.
good,- Bulilds your communication skills
good,Great management team that truly listens to your concerns and problems. Decent hours and fair treatment of employees. Overall the company is a great place to work with great benefits and terrific job security.
good,Not very organized and clear. I was only working their a little over a month and I was let go pretty much with no explaination. I work my best while employed. I did everything asked of me and then some. I honestly though things were going real good as far as my working status.
good,Learned to follow instruction. Fast paced most of the time but it also passes the time.
good,Very serious about providing satisfactory customer service.
good,get to meet new people every day. co workers a re great. hardest part about the job is the angry people with no respect to others. greatest part is the interactions
good,"My typical work day consisted of a steady stream of starbucks customers , I know each local customer by name , management was up and down some good some bad , the hardest part of my job would have been getting along with everyone seemed like everyone had an attitude working there ."
good,Filling prescriptions
good,"Working at Safeway was fun, you were always doing something, it was nice working in the area I lived in and being able to help out the customers and some people I knew while working there."
good,"Fun place to work at, never get bored! very laid back management!"
good,very dynamic and interactive. Lots of customer service
good,I really like this job also. It was very flexible and was a great first job to have as a teenager
good,Safeway has guidelines to follow by law woking in the pharmacy to make sure the medications get to the right person at the right time. Making sure that medications are ordered at ready for customers and ringing them up. Its rare that a customer comes in and the medications are not ready.
good,"Did a lot of running around getting to know the store as well as interacting with customers. Service, service, service."
good,"The culture is very formal, needs to be more flexible. Good goals, and management, promote from within frequently."
good,"The store I worked at in Seattle was always busy and my co-workers made me feel like i was with family. Management can vary from bad to great, I had both. Depending on your job don't expect to get a promotion or raise quickly."
good,"I started out as a bagger at Vons and within 4 months of working there I was promoted to work at Starbucks, then about a year later I was interviewed and asked if I would be the Manager at Starbucks. Working at vons gives you wonderful oportunitys for advansment. Its a great place to work."
good,"I was happy to work part-time and learn about the role of community retail pharmacy. I would have stuck it out longer had the pay been fair. I started pay well below what should have been expected for someone responsible for other's medical conditions. Had I been able to, I would have continued to work there as a student of pharmacy because the hours were so short. I just couldn't sustain myself as a person with such little pay. I was there for quite some time and the store could not offer any technician a full-time position due to the pharmacy not being allowed the labor hours."
good,"It was a cashier job. You went in, scanned things, and left. At the Kirkland location, management is responsive and coworkers are good. Would recommend. However, you need to be firm with your availability and may need to restate it once or twice."
good,"When I worked as a personal shopper the whole crew started at 4:00 am and on the schedule we would leave at 8 am, however I was almost impossible to leave before 8 hours. Part time benefits with full time work.  Many people would come in late but they stayed until all orders where done. Very fast place, constantly walking. I did enjoy that jobs. I know things are greatly different now from when I was working."
good,was a good job easy to do overall coworkers were nice and management were pretty relaxed overall was relaxing to work at wasn't crazy at all most days
good,Working at the deli was good. I got to have more experience with working with others and helping customers. All the managers are friendly. Excellent choice for a first job.
good,ok place of work for new job seekers. teaches you customer service skills and even new life skills. recommended to teens for a part time job. good managers.
good,Entry level is low pay but good experience for retail jobs.  Lots of upward advancement available where you are paid appropriately.  Fun and enjoyable.
good,"It wasn’t a bad job. I loved it. Just for the hours I was putting in and the pay I was getting it wasn’t worth it. I was away from my son for too long and I wasn’t making enough money to support him."
good,I love my position but hours need to be given to those most reliable not by how long you've been there. Raises should be given annually with a salary cap depending on the job.
good,Good company to work. I've been shown alot and was able to apply the skills I learned from foods co. Hard to maintain good workers due to management changes.
good,it is a nice place for part time work. It comes under Union so advancement is very slow. salary is minimum wage. no befits at part time level. good place to learn about retail.
good,"Gone are the days when this was a well paid, secure position. Management was ALWAYS terrible. They ran the company on intimidation of employees. The Union job paid well , but now the Union has been paid off and is there only as an artificial 'Token"""
good,My hours were inconsistent.  1 week 30+ hours and other weeks 15 hours. Working with customers is a joy and makes any of my jobs worth the days of work
good,Greeting the customer. Helping customers find items. Grab items for customers.  I also cashiered and hung tags. Working for that company was a great experience
good,"I worked graveyard shift so I don't know how daytime or swing was like. Every shift there is vastly different. Was some drama at the main store but I was at the gas station. Winter time sucks working out there, especially at night"
good,"Working at safeway is one of the best ways to introduce someone into the working world.  As it was my first job, the staff was very team oriented and most of my coworkers were very helpful and caring.  From helping with tasks I didn't know I didn't know how to handle, to helping with understanding the benfits the job comes with as well."
good,Fun workplace but the store needs security bad. Been there for a year and it is not bad you get overtime when it is the holidays. Sometimes a little to much. Over all cool company to work for
good,"The woman that hired me gave me wrong impressions from the get go. Heard negative things when employed there. The reason I left was because I was hired full time, but the last week or two before I decided to leave, I was only given 1-2 shifts on my schedule. No one can live on that."
good,For example theirs normally a big rush hour but once that ends its super slow. The hardest part about the job is just dealing with rude customers. While the easiest is doing Sweeps or any easy task such as that.
good,"Faced paced environment, As a personal shopper, responsible for pulling online customer's grocery orders , scanned picked and packed for delivery, Every day was different and very faced paced. My department  manager was very hardworking and very patient, nice guy."
good,"Definitely for entry level job seekers, just looking to get some more experience. Overall management was fair, and reasonable. Can be very busy and hectic at times. Most certainly would not recommend making a career out of it, however they have many long time employees that have moved up within the company."
good,"management is always wiling to work with you when you have life problems arise and understanding. co workers are upbeat and friendly, and willing to help..."
good,".Manage the daily production standards of union selectors."
good,"Easy, fun work environment with many opportunities to advance. Perfect job during school. Very accommodating with hours. Understanding easy to work with managers."
good,"I worked in Safeways in both Airdrie, Alberta and Lethbridge, Alberta. At the Airdrie location I felt like my work and presence was valued. My co-workers worked as a team and the management were constantly communicating with us. The place was a wonderful work environment and our consumers were happy. "
good,I pilled orders and stack the pallets in a timely matter.When you get your order you have to get on a pallet jack and grab to pallets and completely pick all items on your list.
good,"As a employee for Safeway it's been nice working for them .but also been stressful I have felt unappreciated as I have been deli trainer for 7 months in the past and never have I got employee of the month others that I've trained got it 2 of them .And as I moved to day stocking a girl that I trained in a month of that she was awarded employee of the month in August will be my 2 years with them and I'm just ready to possibly start a new path for myself. I do alot for Safeway from helping in lots of departments like deli ,floral, cashiering, day stocking., and recently helping bakery out. 😔 iam a mother of 3 and work my hardest to feel this low ."
good,"When I started at Albertsons, before we turned into Safeway, I was just looking for a temporary job to support me while I was going through school. I have been cross-trained in almost every single department there is at the store and each one has different skills that you need to know in order to do your job proficiently. Customer Service is the most important aspect of the store and to keep the customers happy! The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my co-workers and having a good time. The hardest part of my job is often times dealing with stressful situations that arise."
good,"Job was fair for the most part, not enough employees working at the time I was there which led to me having a lot of hours with no in between day off time."
good,Working here for less then a year was good. No real problem with the system. Being a part of the Bakery showed my how simple things really are. Gotta wake up extra early to open the bakery.
good,"Safeway is a good company, with a habit of putting unqualified people in managerial positions. I love my job but I make 10.80 an hour and my Union contract says im owed 11.50 but they havemt given me a raise since I started."
good,"slow venue, not a huge growth opportunity , poor pay, no opportunity to grow, no advancement opportunity not a compatible pay, benefits are just ok. but not good"
good,They call it slaveway for a reason. They often understaff departments and then apply pressure to staff that are scheduled. There is a lot of politics involved which creates bias on who will be promoted. Promotions not based on how many years or experience or dedication. I've witnessed a meat cutter who was there 5 years still being paid the current minimum wage. While a new person was hired 3 dollars over that rate. Should be illegal. Wheres the moral In that?
good,"The safe way I worked at is no longer around, however when i worked there it was fun. My boss was nice and willing to always help when needed the other employees all seemed positive."
good,A typical day at Safeway as a courtesy clerk for me woodstar around 11 most the time bingo for about 4 or 5 hours. the word for the most part is laid-back you can get a little bit stressed out of times I'm busy days but other than that it's not too hard
good,Working overnight in a Safeway is a gloomy and lonesome prospect as you're one of perhaps six or seven other people tasked with refilling the shelves of a very large store in the middle of night. Assuming you can maintain a satisfactory speed to appease the management of your particular store you're pretty much golden as far as workload and regular pay advances go but expect to be called in often to fill in for absentee co-workers or satisfy your self important managers whims.
good,"So far I don't have any problem working at Safeway, it just that I looking for something will help in future and willy to pay good amount of salary that can provide me to pay expense."
good,"Throughout school I found this a great place to work. They really worked with my schedule (although this could've just been my location and not every location). It can be very busy, and at times high stress, but overall a good place to work."
good,"Good company, bad at backing up employees against customer complaints. Not very strong union. Employee moral is not the best. Overall not a bad company to work for. Jude’s have to know what your signing  up for."
good,during my time at Safeway i learned a lot of skills. but one of the most stressful things that happened very often was getting called in on your one day off even if you only work part time. the management was nice and the job was relatively straight forward but some people would try to over complicate things.
good,"great people, not the best hours! Hours vary constantly, and you never know what you are going to get. My manager was great, and genuinely cared about my well being"
good,"When I applied, I got a call for an interview within a couple hours, and got the job right away. Early on, hours were good - 40 hours/week, 8/day, consistent hours and days. After a few months, someone from the regional office came in and had problems with the situation and hours had to be cut. This has dropped me down to less than 20 hours/week, about 4/day working 3-4 days a week. While the wage isn't bad, it's not enough to live on, and it's unlikely to get more hours any time soon."
good,Safeway was a nice job that helps you build and develop customer service skills and treating customers right. You learn a lot about working with others and confronting g difficult task.
good,"Secure but lack advancements, managements are fairly approachable but all depends on the store, and stores vary significantly from location to location."
good,"As a Service Desk Manager my position was very hectic. I was in charge of money orders, lotto, Western Union, invoice cataloging, dr cleaning, employee violation signatures collected and many more responsibilities. With that said, I absolutely loved the fast paced and busy schedule that I was responsible for."
good,"A typical day at work as a Courtesy Clerk, you will clock in, sweep twice every hour, clean the bathroom once each shift, clean deli area, bag, help customers and collect carts through out your shift."
good,"Stocking shelves with bread"
good,This is a good first job it teaches you professionalism and work flow. There is alot to do but it keeps you on you toes and busy. They are a competitor so there is alot of checks from upper management but it isn't to stressful. Overall good place.
good,"I enjoyed the work, fast paced.  I learned how to make salads, sandwiches, keeping the areas clean and neat.  I had a great manager to work with and who appreciated the work that was done."
good,"I currently work here, it is not a bad job but I do not get paid enough for all the things that I have to do and put up with in the work place. People are nice but the management can be hypocritical a lot of the time."
good,"It was an ok place to work. When I started there, my coworkers warned me that it was terrible, but it wasn't that bad. I made several valuable connections with management who were eager to help me progress in my Safeway career."
good,Overall good experience but that came with longevity and raises that followed. But couldn’t handle the retail hours of weekends and holidays after so many years in a row
good,"Management is poor, but other than that it is a fun place to work at, great co- workers, great customers, etc..............................................."
good,"I worked the graveyard shift and threw overnight freight and stocked shelves, was a fast paced workplace but you learn a lot of things as you go and my co workers were awesome so it made the night shifts better. The hardest part of the job would probably have been throwing freight for 4 hours a night but it ended up being a good workout. Overall I loved the job I just had to relocate because I wasn't making enough money to live on the Oregon coast because the cost of living is expensive on the coast."
good,Learned through experiences in retail and in information technology and working with customers on a day to day basis. I was team lead member whom assisted other team colleagues on improving support tasks to have optimal results within our infrastructure.
good,I enjoy working there because it's fast pace . Dealing with different type customer can be a challenge. But it's a great experience to interact with variety people.
good,"keep up on produce dept and knowledge of product in season"
good,I enjoyed working here but the management is awful. We would go days even weeks without some supplies because the manager of our department wouldnt order it in time. Good flexible hours if youre okay with having to make-do with what you have. it makes the job 10x harder in my opinion.
good,"In my particular experience I found the area of the store I was placed in was very poorly managed and everyone knew it. Though the upper management tried to help with more people the department manager did not train, they did not seem knowledgeable of the department and how to create a less stressful environment for the employees, and the two shifts were quick to place blame on the other rather than try to work together to run the department more cohesively. Often the department was understaffed for the workload and it caused a obvious strain on the employees to stay on top of the tasks. Over all the workplace was quite negative. Though there were a few wonderful employees many that I dealt with were disgruntled to how management handled issues in the workplace."
good,I enjoyed my time with Safeway . All of the people  that l worked with were very nice . I had to return to Illinois for Family reasons . I also was able to establish a good rapor with the students.
good,"I quite enjoyed my time at Safeway, the management was great and very flexible with hours and vacation time. Great benefits for employees as workplace is unionized. Good pay and good people, every day at work was a good day because of the people I worked with"
good,"Pay is good, hours can be long. Customer service is number one priority so if your a people person and are flexible on days off and hours worked then this could be a good place to work for you."
good,"Good college job"
good,"Absolutely phenomenal management training, room to advance if you look for it, but there is a slight bit of competitiveness over the management positions. "
good,"I started as a Courtesy Clerk in 2014 and moved my way up over the years to a Journeyman Meat Cutter in 2018, so advancement is there if you're willing to work to get there. Since store management is constantly getting switched around, it's hard to give an opinion on ANY specific store, I don't care where you work."
good,It's a very slow ladder to climb if you want to earn more than minimum wage but as a starting job it's a fantastic environment. The workers and customers are all friendly.
good,It's a good place to work.  It comes with benefits and flexible hours overall a good place to work.  If you want to advance and a manager it has opportunites for advancement.
good,"The job is an extremely flexible workplace. It involves lots of cleaning and time management. It is a good job while you are in school. However, you will have to move up to make a good living."
good,Worked on Process mapping for the human resources team.Friendly employees and good work culture.Management was encouraging.Excellent internship program.
good,Well first of my review on this job is that it looks fun but its a lot of work. I would like to work as Barista/Cashier because I like the customer service and how they help out the customers.
good,Learned a lot about different types of food and how to prepare them. The staff become almost like a family. Interact with customers. opportunity to get a lot of hours.
good,IT was a good work experience. I learned a lot about how to work heavy machines and operate forklifts. Hours were not the best but the pay was very good
good,"I liked working for Safeway, the experience got better with each store I've worked at. Great place to start a career specially if your in High school and want a job."
good,"Working night crew, a typical day is fairly quiet. Stocking and zoning,keeping an eye on night shoppers, and so on."
good,Good small outfit.  Compared to other retail stores very behind in tech but have a strong core group of workers who they treat well overall.  Would work for them again.
good,"Not much to say everything started changing when the store was bought out, the people are friendly though. I recommend knowing how to have fun while you work."
good,Was good place to work and raise my family. They totally treated us really good tell they merged with Albertsons.  Now the culture is horrible. Very cut throat
good,"For the most part, Safeway was the best job I have had, (so far) great people (mostly) in a comfy environment. The worst part of the job is stuff like carts. They always find a way to hurt you and are hard to control."
good,"good place to work, frirendly co-workers, gets so busy when it is break time, if youre not comfortable with standing on feet, it wouldnt be the best job for you"
good,"It is not a difficul work to handle. Customers come form different backgroud. Being a casher, I am able to meet,  talk and learn from different customers. Manager will value your work and respect each employees. I am promoted to be a customer service and learn to manage money in the bookkeeper office. Colleagues are from different culture and places, we respect each other and get along well too. I like to work with different people since I could learn a lot from them."
good,I really don't like doing reviews. I liked working there. There were pros and cons much like any other job in the world. Safeway was good to me. And I will always be grateful to Safeway.
good,I  was in high and it was nice decent money but time to advance and make more money. I would come in and check in and go to my job location and preform my duties necessary for the day
good,I would say Safeway has really changed over the years and it’s just not the same at all. As far as management goes it has really changed over the years and it’s not the same as it use to be. I would say overall it’s significantly changed over the years and it’s not the same company as it was 7 years.
good,"It was a fun work place , the interactions with customers is an eye opening experience. The people there are collaborative and well trained and every understanding"
good,This is a face paced work environment.  Great opportunity for advancement.  Great support from management.  Excellent benefits.  Very flexible hours and competitive salary.
good,"Overall Safeway is a good place to work.  However, merger of Sobeys/Safeway did create tension. Micro managing was annoying.Changes in management at my store created  morale problems,"
good,Working for Safeway was very good. The company is great. I work lots of overtime. Great coworkers. I love the bonuses that I received. The management was not very good.
good,I genuinely enjoyed working at Safeway for the time that I was there. We went through a few managers in my time there but for the most part they were fairly nice but near the end they wouldn't give me time off that I needed or wouldn't give me hours that I was available to work.
good,"they only hire on a part-time basis, pay is minimum wage."
good,"Working in the bakery consisted of looking in the cases and determining what I needed, then pulling those items from the freezer and/or making them myself; decorating cakes and cupcakes either with generic designs or following custom orders made by customers."
good,"Very multicultural. With only a handful of employees in the deli department, it gets very busy most of the time. I definitely improved my english speaking with a lot of different customers."
good,"Fast paced, but hours are very unsteady, employees are enjoyable to work with and met a lot of nice people. Management was fairly good. Learned a lot about customer service."
good,Muy buen trabajo dentro de lo que cabe con buen personal y formas de trabajo.
good,"I did graveyard shifts for about 8 months here, was promised I would get day shifts if I felt like I couldn't handle nights anymore however when I requested days there were no hours, bummer."
good,I worked here as long as I did because there was a union that made sure to take care of me. I had awful store and assistant managers that were not ethical.
good,I worked here through college and it was a great experience. I met a lot of nice people and developed a strong work ethic. Safeway accommodated my college schedule.
good,Working in the deli was hot. Especially during the summer time. I did enjoy helping customers and making food to put in the hot case. Or cutting ham and cheese for people. Helping customers made me think it wasn’t so hot after all and helping people is something I love to do
good,"in the bakery there was alot to do each day, had to maintain food prep conditions, customer service, daily prep of next day product , had to bake goods all day keep the product stocked."
good,"I work as a Personal Shopper in Safeway's Dotcom business. My day starts at 5:00 am. My job consists of filling the online orders of each given day. I log into a machine that tells me what the customer wants along with the information of whether or not they are willing to take a different item if the one the desire is out of stock. After all the items are retrieved I set them up to be delivered by our delivery men."
good,"A typical day at Safeway for me is clocking in and then going to the manager on shift to as where they want me to be at that moment or who to take over for. I'm a checker, so i scan people items so they can pay and that's what i do the entire shift and you get a few breaks depending on how long your shift is. The management at Safeway is really well organized and they are nice people. I learned more about customer service."
good,I stock different commodities in the grocery store shelves. Clean the area.work in midnight shift. There is a union. The company management is ok. The  union benifits are ok.
good,"Great place to start working if no experience. I’ve come across poor management multiple times, eventually causing me to come to an end at working for safeway."
good,I worked as a cashier.  We rang people's items up and handled some reviews.  Our store was very busy most of the day and usually under staffed as well.
good,"this was a great job for me, especially when i was just a courtesy clerk, and all that was expected of me was to greet and help customers.  I was then promoted to GMHBC, and also got trained on pricing, audits, resets,  etc. However with that advancement there also came much more responsibility and at times it can be overwhelming, as the crew could sometimes see insubordinate, with a cut-throat like atmosphere.  Also their starting wage was only $7.25  per hr while the national wage was $8.25/hr.  But because they offered health insurance (expensive), they were allowed to get away with paying that wage.  There were plenty of opportunities to learn new skills, and to interact with the public."
good,"This job can be stressful due to the nature of the work, it rovides daily challenges, but if you work hard there are opprotunities for advancement. The pay isnt very competitive for the entry level positions like a courtesy clerk."
good,"Working at safeway can be fun at times when they have random events and parties for employees.  Management have interesting views on things outside the work place which keeps it more laid back when conversations come up. Not alot of guessing when it comes to work, most the time you can come in and get right to work."
good,"Schedule is good for part-timer, schedule is put out 1 1/2 weeks in advance.  The people there are nice and work with you to get a schedule that works for you.  Extra hours are available if someone calls in sick."
good,"Not too stressful most of the time, compensation could be better, good first job. People are great coworkers and many customer relations are great. Management is ok."
good,"Stocking shelves, cleaning up any spills, operating a forklift for unpacking shipping trucks and moving products. Late night part-time hours for minimum wage wasn't fun, but it was a job. The management staff was helpful and attentive."
good,It was absolutly great to be able to help the people with whatever was needed . The employee's treated me quite well except for a few manager's .. No level of work is good enough ...... I feel good work is to be rewarded not overlooked
good,"busy "
good,Overall good job. Didn't care for the Deli clerk position and was unable to transfer to a different position within the store due to lack workers in the deli dept.
good,"It's a wonderful atmosphere, very clean, very productive, management may have gotten better, but overall not a bad company to work for mostly easy work"
good,I like meeting new people. But every week the hours change. It's good if you get promoted. So far there isn't any advancement for me. It's good we get paid every Thursday.
good,"Good place to work, great coworkers. Unfortunatly low pay and minimal chance of advancement. I have worked there 4 years and have not advanced much the people who have been there 20 plus years have more seniority"
good,"I learned to organizate thing fast and compeletly we have to behave good and kind with customer."
good,"This is a very close knit of people that have worked there for a long time, together.  The hours are not great but if you are looking for something that only offers 12-20 hours it would be great."
good,A place for people who do not want to work hard and want to abuse their seniority. I worked with a bunch of them before. 4 employees stole groceries from the store and the store manager did not care about it at all!  People were lazy but had higher seniority than me kept giving me her mid-night shifts and taking my shifts away.
good,Managers will work a 10 - 12 hour day. Two days off but will often spend some off time dealing with work issues or getting caught up. Manage approx. 120 employees. Customer Service is a big part of your entire day. Expectation is to be on sales floor 80% of your day. Constant redirection from upper management can be very stressful. Management goals are to develop employees for advancement and when you can find time to do this it can be a very rewarding experience for both manager and employee.
good,"My typical days were packaging medications for customers of our auto fill service. We would often take phone calls to answer questions or look into patients files for medications that needed refills and send faxes to doctors. I would take prescriptions from customers and fill them to their specifications for purposes of billing. I would also package bubble packs for customers that needed help with their individual time needs for multiple medications. I learned a lot for time management skills, customer service and cashiers work."
good,"It was a decent workplace. I'm neutral about it, not much to say about it. Sometimes staff could be rude, other times friendly. Customers could be extremely rude at times."
good,I was a rehire great start for me and I will recommend others as well to work with Safeway it was a  learning experience I was able to be a successful with working as a team and being promoted to verious positions
good,I loved working at Safeway in the deli! I would of never left if I didn't move back to Illinois. My work family were awesome. The days always went by pretty fast. Never a duel moment over there!
good,"This job was good experience for me in terms of learning how to interact with customers and provide quality service to shoppers. I also learned how to food prep effectively and meet daily stocking requirements. I enjoyed the knowledge this job taught me. Although I moved on to a company more suited to what I was looking for, I appreciate this position in my work history"
good,Descent place too work especially if you have small children or attend school. Routes are flexible can obtain other jobs cause it's seasonal. Your out in thee summer. You don't have any benefits but if your Lively hood is made then you have no worries but if ur trying to have benefits and make a living then this is not the typical job.
good,I really enjoyed  working at safeway. If i didn't have to come back home to minnesota i would still be employed there. It was a fast paced deli so the time flew by. There was always something to do. Safeway catered to their customers and they went above and beyond to make them happy. Which I thought was great. The whole store was busy. It's a big store but very clean and organized. It was just a nice place to work. The deli was huge and had a wide variety of deli meats and cheeses. We also had a large variety of salads in our deli case. We had a whole deli case of hot food too that eas pretty good. Especially our fried chicken. And we had a sandwich bar where customers could custom order a fresh dandwich. I guess you could say we had it all.
good,"My time at Safeway/Sobeys Canada has been a positive one. The staff have been an absolute joy to work with, as well as none of the positions have been very difficult to learn."
good,"Back room merchandise processing; organize unloaded merchandise; process transfer or damaged items; maintain the store during the night making sure the store looks neat professional, customer service, cashiers and help manage and order for the Milk Dept."
good,Loved my job but did not like the new management.  Loved that I had lots of work to do and was kept very busy.  My co-workers in bakery were great and we all worked very well as a team.
good,"There is always something to do. Very fast paced work environment. If you stay positive everyday, there is always something new to learn and help advance for personal and work growth."
good,A typical day working at Safeway is demanding. If not enough courtesy clerks so up you do the work of five men this is much more common than you would expect.
good,"I liked the work and was okay with the pay. However the hours I received weren't good for any sort of long term work. I am leaving after a year here because this job just can't cover my bills when I get less than 15-20 hours a week usually. "
good,"Its a very chill job, good first job. Seems to suck people in and many of the workers there tell you how they got stuck there so go to school. Sometimes customers are very picky but depends on location."
good,"You tend to enjoy a job when the worst part of the job is the hot weather outside. Safeway has had some of the nicest fellow employees one could work with, reasonable wages with very flexible work schedules. However, just from personal experience, you may end up working rather late or at the crack of dawn. Again, just from personal experience. There are also some duties they'll ask you to do that training exercises won't prepare you for, which can be glaring for the first time, but you get into the swing of things fairly quickly."
good,"Although I met some very nice people and made some good money, I found the job to be very stressful and at other times, boring. Being a cashier is a lot more difficult then it looks. I would only take this job again if I was desperate for money."
good,"I met a lot of cool people working at Starbucks. When there was time it was nice to be able to have conversations with customers. Management isn't bad, but it isn't great either."
good,"A typical day at safeway is usually just helping customers and performing normal cashier duties, along with the job of every other clerk at the store, produce, deli, meat, and the courtesy clerks."
good,Management is ok.. love to blame things kn others that they have control over.... but overall most people are great to work with.. hard to get days off u want in retail
good,hired for part-time but several weeks I would get no hours or I would get to work and they would tell me they didn't need me. the management didn't seem to know how to schedule
good,The people in the store is great just the store manager is a bad person and will select certain people to pick on about there work or their appearance and criticize it but allow other would be allowed so he is not a fair or even manager
good,"Simple work, keeps you busy. My first job and honestly didn't take it too seriously. bag groceries, return carts, sweep the store was the basics of it all."
good,"Safeway is a fun and good place for young and older people to work. It teaches young workers the way around basic knowledge on customer service , problem solving skills and organization. Everyday I stock merchandise for the customers and for a good looking store. The management is in order and everyone works as a team. I enjoy working here."
good,"It's not the most exciting job in the world, and the unions take a little too much off of your salary, but a pretty easy job for minimum wage pay. We had a break every 2-3 hours and had the ability to book days off 2 weeks in advance."
good,A great work environment was established quickly during my time there. The management team as well as the a lot of my co-workers worked really hard so we could all come to meet one goal.
good,I was able to travel with Safeway. I worked in Hawaii for 1.5 years and all over the colorado area. I liked the people and the job structure We had a lot of fun .
good,It felt as though the managers didn't care for their workers. Considering that there was so many departments to keep up with that it's as if they don't know your name. But besides that I enjoyed my time working there. It was  a great place to have your first job. It was fun seeing a new face every day. But you can't depend on management when something goes wrong because they can't keep up with all the workers.
good,I love the people I work with and wouldn't change that. I do not like how others and myself included are paid poorly for the hard work that we do. I believe we should all feel great about coming to work.
good,"People are great to work with, Plan on working about 30 hours a week. Lots of lifting, twisting and bending, Can be a fun place to work, But be willing to work, if you work in the bakery."
good,"The job is okay, not paid enough money and not much room for advancement, the people are okay, going home at 7:30 am is the best part of the job."
good,"changed corp. don't know enough for honest review,ownership i had not worked for.......bakery was constant pace ,number driven on measurements of completion and growth of job security,markets driven on labor cost and allocations of operations,streamline on labor effect,squeezing to tight labor of the hand pick few .union based ,but also hand pick few who can gain benefit of company goals ,which is destructive to all managers and union employees,unhealthy for most."
good,"It was fun fast working environment. At times it was hard to keep up but managed. My Coworkers were fun to work with, we worked as a team. I cooked the deli meals a lot, assisted customers."
good,"I started when I was 15, and it was a good part time job for high school students. The only bad part about this job at the time was the management. They were never on the same page and would pick favorites."
good,"Work environment is good. I enjoy working there and learnt a lot. Management is good. I work mostly in the evening till closing, There are lots of work for me but I enjoy doing it, Wish the pay was a little better but no complains."
good,"I was lucky to have worked with such an awesome group of people.  Our store associates were a team and for the most part fun to work with.  Management assisted, and mentored me through the learning times."
good,"communication, teamwork, flexible hours, training, learning, stay busy, loving and caring co workers.  Great place to work.  Exciting and wonderful. Ex"
good,"Every shift that i had would be the closing shift where i would service the customers at the meat and seafood counter, wrap products to put out for customer purchase, i would also clean and sanitize the department."
good,"We do work very hard - some of the regular customers are nice, my manager is a very good person, they try to do their best with schedules also."
good,Constantly moving until the jobs done consist of a lot of physical activity and is very fast paced job details include erecting and dismantle of scaffolding material typically in construction sites
good,"Working tills, serving customers, doing stock checks, maintaining cleanliness of the store and taking in deliveries"
good,Well I will prefer not to work in a groccery store but more in a clean envirornment like a hotel or an assisted living or a Secetary job enviornment because I feel their is better Customer Service or better Manager's to work with.
good,when I worked for Safeway the deli manager was so disrespectful and always tried to get me in trouble for things I didn't do. she also would forget to give me my sons Dr appointment days off and i would get in trouble and she would say I didn't tell her in time when i gave her a 3 weeks notice. on top of that my co-workers at night would refuse to help customers and just focus on closing leaving me with a line
good,"Work is fast pace , can be over worked occasionally , low hours, but good supervisors and managers, hardest part of the job is the amount that has to be done in a very short amount of time due to low hours.The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that new and interesting people can be met. Most of my co-workers are very good people who just want to do better."
good,"I work very hard, but I don't have enough incoming. when I look to my background experience, I think this is not my really job."
good,"Enjoyed my time working in the floral department, interacting with customers on a daily basis. I have learned so much working in the floral department when it comes to time management, organization skills, and customer service."
good,"The only thing I liked about Vons was the customers I provided my services to. The store manager and the assistant manager didn't provide the services I needed to work there. The store manager and the assistant manager I no longer there at Vons, but that is okay I loved working for my customers."
good,"Great Starting wage, Management needs some work. Fast paced environment, with  friendly co-workers. Great union protection and decent time incremented raises."
good,"it was not a bad place to work at the time. Friendly environment and very safe workplace. "
good,"Great management training within the company!"
good,"Great company to work for due to its flexible hours.  It is great for people who lives near BART, which is a 10 minutes walk."
good,"Safeway was a very enjoyable place to work. My coworkers were all friendly and did their share of work, and the customers were a bonus. I learned how to properly address people, and time management working at Safeway."
good,"Depending on the job duty that day but its always customer service food handling and money handling, daily food inspection and paper work, daily orders and distress spoiled food that has to be recorded daily. Temp and tare log, keeping up on foods temperature and weight of the container of product. cooking and prepping, phone orders. cleaning of department, deposing of all waste."
good,"Meat cutting is an excellent job if you can make it work.shifts range from early morning to just before lunch to start and end usually around the 7:30 pm area. "
good,"I have worked in the fast food industry, which is a switch when it comes to completely, covering the spectrum of food and drink. I have expanded my skillset by boarding my base with sushis and cheeses. This has been an amazing experience, just not able to live off this minimum wage in this area,"
good,"Working at Safeway taught me a lot on how a big corporation works. Each day I would clock in, greet customers, get my requirements for the day and get straight to work. I would start at the front of the store bagging groceries for customers, normally a shift up front lasted for about an hour. I would then make my way outside and work my way from cart stall to cart stall, bringing the carts inside. Once that was finished I would begin my sweep of the hour, which meant I swept the whole store and answered any customers needs as I made my round. The hardest part about the job was bringing in carts, but it was tolerable. The most enjoyable part was working upfront and being hands on with people."
good,"I was a cashier and I absolutely loved my job , I loved to help other employees and customers . I am friendly so being a cashier is a great job for me . I had many friends ."
good,I really enjoyed this job. There were plenty of opportunities  to set your self a part from the rest. Just do your job right! I enjoy working with the public and was able to learn a new skill.
good,"Depending on who you're working with this job can be fantastic or great pain in the neck. Some of the management is really friendly, where as others would really like to abuse their authority."
good,Safeway is pretty decent job to get quick money with weekly pay. The most enjoyable part of working night crew is having the freedom during the day to either pick up another job or do thing during the day.
good,"i loved working there and enjoyed all my customers but working for the old store manager was not fun."
good,management was outgoing but wanted to have everyone out of their way in their last few hours of work to get home as soon as they could.working with both clerks and cashiers was a fun experience but  some people could not handle fast paced work area during the holidays.
good,"There is a lot of diversity. Job is mentally challenging. A lot of nice employees and great customers.  The hardest part of the job is working holidays.  You don't get to enjoy being with your family.  But on the plus side you do get time and a half and holiday pay.  We are a team amongst all employees.  Everyone knows everyone including our customers.  I have learned so many things at Safeway.  When I became the seafood manager, I didn't really know the first thing about seafood, but as long as I had the desire to learn, that was all that mattered."
good,"I enjoyed working for Safeway because it was very easy moving up in the company with hard work, I've met a lot of people during my year of employment with Safeway."
good,The produce section was very well run. Efficiency was maintained in all aspects at all times.  My fellow employees and the Produce Manager were a pleasure to work alongside.
good,Fun Friendly Experience Got a chance to learn retail it showed responsibility and how to communicate and good customer Services
good,"Working at Safeway isn't so hard, it's all about getting the right fit for you and it's easy to move around as long as you have a good manager. From my experience you can have the best attitude and be friendly but some days people will just drive you up the wall and that's why having good management is a key."
good,"A typical day at work is extremely busy. A grocery store is constantly full of people- all day long, all week long, all month long. By having a strong work ethic working through the day is easy to accomplish."
good,"-upper management was okay."
good,"Safeway is a good place to work at. During my time at Safeway, I learned about customer service and how to deal with coworkers. Working at Safeway was my 1st job ever and it allowed me to be exposed to the workforce. The hardest part about working at Safeway was standing for long hours at a time."
good,"Depending on which department you work in would depend on how busy you would be. In the Deli you would be running back and forth between the different tables/ stations to assist customers. While back in the bakery things were much slower, but there was more over cooking and inventory loss."
good,customer service is the number one priority at Safeway so if you love working with people you should definitely join Safeway's team.
good,"•	Pleasantly provided World Class service to maximize customers satisfaction  "
good,Great coworkers and good management.  Schedule can be a little unpredictable both in number of hours worked and when the hours are.
good,"Fun job, really cool atmosphere. Just looking for a change of pace. I've been working in coffee for almost 6 years, and would enjoy a change of pace."
good,The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with Division Designers and their request for planning a layout to meet the needs of a Division
good,Easy job to learn but also easy to make pricey mistakes. Overall a good job with the occasional BBQs and parties. Must work some holidays and jobs aren't always secure.
good,"Busy work lots of cleaning, frying, and sandwich making. Rotating shifts. All in all not a horrible place to work. The break room is not secure therefore things would get stolen."
good,I loved this job. I loved what i did. I loved the customer interaction. I didn't find that working for the union was all I thought it would be. Raises are hard to come by and they company pays very little for what's expected of their employees if the employees do their job correctly.
good,"They are ok, i mean i would not plan on staying there very long.  It is a great stepping stone to learn how the corp world works."
good,"A typical day at work consists of bagging customer's grocery's, assisting customers with liquor service, collecting cart's from the parking lot, directing customers through the store to simplify, and make their shopping experience more productive."
good,"I really enjoy working in a retail establishment and Safeway is a great place to work. The management is exceptional,coworkers show positive attitude when at work. I am pleased with the overall atmosphere as an employee and as a full time shopper at Safeway."
good,Now with the pending merger the office will eventually be closed in Pleasanton and it is a pretty sad workplace now.
good,"Safeway was in a period of extreme growth and had a difficult time keeping up with this in terms of employee training . They overcame this time with an innovative customer experience training program called a "" shop "" . This was a proven way to train team members and get valuable in site to the guest experience at store level . This program has been copied by most chains in the business and is standard practice for many companies outside the industry ."
good,Safeway was a great work place for me because i got along with all the employes and had a good time working for them.
good,"Manage around 100 employees."
good,"There is no typical day at work in the retail business."
good,"Safeway is a wonderful place to work with great people."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for both Safeway and Vons, I had great mentors and learned a lot but worked lots of hours due to being over ambitious (70 to 80 a week)  I was young and competitive and not willing to make a work life balance for myself. So it was my own fault looking back on it but overall great companies."
good,Decent working environment with no employment discounts.
good,A typical day at work comes down to doing your best to make customers happy. I have learned to look at things with a different perspective so that I can see the flaws. I work well with coworkers because I think as a team player. I enjoy going to work because of the great co-workers.
good,"I enjoy this Safeway mostly because of my co-workers they are a great group of people. Management is also Great for the most part sure everyone has their ups and downs that's life even at work. We have a great selection of products to choose from I do all my shopping here even before I worked for Safeway. The Safeway Company strives to be a Team playing store with Great customer service skills. The team we have at this store really likes to meet the standards of our customers, some even go above and beyond just to make that customer truly satisfied."
good,"Cashiering gets boring after awhile, not to many people you can associate with."
good,"Night shift is difficult, overall workplace is good. Coworkers are very friendly. Management is tough but run everything smoothly. Breaks and lunch are the most enjoyable part."
good,"Vons wasn't too bad. easy to deal with. Management was a little weird. I was hired under the agreement that I could referee soccer on the weekends as a 2nd job then all of a sudden they started scheduling me on weekends and made me choose between refereeing soccer and working there. And since I made as much in 2 days refereeing as I did in 6 days at vons, I quit."
good,"Ill just start off by saying that the pay there sucked, it was bearly enough to get by, but not much more after that.  Store management was great, but district management was a nightmare."
good,"I learned how to successfully manage a crew, which in this type of environment can be much like juggeling balls in the air. Some of my daily tasks involved -placing weekly orders, scheduling employees, and coaching and mentoring Legendary Service. This included but was not limited to: custom crafting Starbucks beverages, sales, merchandising, customer relations, customer service, health and sanitation requirements, inventory control, report writing, report generation, field service outreach, staff meetings, seasonal display changes, and sales conference calls. The coworkers were great. The hardest part of the job were the rushes of customers. Some of them had very large orders, and this would hold the line up for some time, and we were expected to server customers within a 3 minute window of time once they got in line. I loved every part of this job! It challenged me to grow and provided me with the skills I needed to advance further."
good,Great company to work for.....no day is ever the same which keeps things exciting.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know many different types of people.
good,Safeway is a good company to work for. They allowed a good balance between family and work.  Good systems in place.  I feel they have strong customer awareness compared to their competitions.
good,"Assist customers make thier purchases with a smile. The staff and customers are friendly and helpful. "
good,"Going around the store and giving co-workers my help whenever they needed it."
good,"Courtesy clerks are majority the janitors of the store. Not really why I went there to start. I have years of customer service experience and that hardly got put to use besides bagging groceries and helping people out to the car or to find something. Nothing wrong with the job, just not what I expected."
good,"Safeway is a great working environment, they were very open to young workers beginning their job list as teenagers. Most of the co-workers were great, it was a rare occasion I ran into a slight problem with any employee. They did not train very well, I was often left alone in the Starbucks Kiosk wondering how to perform certain tasks. Some days they were not willing to work with my volunteering schedule that was required for school."
good,"Opportunities exist to advance to management, however, it will be expected of you to work 10 hour days, which would be a problem for me because I have three small children."
good,"I handle all cash, credit cards. master cards , and checks as well as all customer service . I helped customer find whatever they needed bagged and place grocery neatly in basket ."
good,I am a Cashier at Safeway so I tend to deal a lot with the customers. I ring through their groceries and have a conversation with who ever I am dealing with at that moment. It is fun talking to a lot of different people in a day. My coworkers are awesome and the management is a wonderful team.
good,there was alot to learn but i managed to learn easy and well without getting it repeated
good,"The pumps were always busy, easy job, if you have cash register experience.  The co workers were nice and they would help if I had any questions."
good,"Answering phones while handling issues with customers, and providing excellent customer service."
good,"Overall, I have loved working in the pharmacy at Safeway. My coworkers have been like family to me and I absolutely love our loyal and regular customers. To be a part of someone else's life, through hardships and deaths, to good times and family vacations has been a life changing experience for me. I have learned how to refine my customer satisfaction skills and I have been able on may occasions been able to turn angry and disgruntled customers into loyal regulars. The hardest part of my job has been dealing with the passing of our customers when it does happen. There are a few men and women I will never forget and I miss them so much. I wish I had more time to connect and create more professional relationships with more customers, however recently with the cut in hours and help it has made that aspect plus many others difficult even sometimes impossible."
good,"To many chiefs and not enough Indians, A secured a certificate for driving a pallet truck, friendly helpful work mates, Getting to work so early without my own transport, Starting early which gave me an early finish where i was able to enjoy time with my family."
good,"I would be responsible for visiting 30no stores across South East England including London, the Channel Islands & Gibraltar to check on reactive maintenance repairs & then get contractors to undertake the works."
good,Working at safe way was a good thing.  Overall I had a lot of fun working there so it was not work for me.  The only reason I am not working there now ... is I broke my ankle an was in a cast for three months so had to give up the position.
good,"My assigned externship site was a Safeway Pharmacy. Given that it was an externship, I cannot comment on the compensation/benefits, job security, or anything pertaining to that side of the company. The only thing I can comment on is my experience with the staff. They were nice and welcoming, but a bit intimidating; That's mostly on my part though. It was a nice mix of being easy and understanding and being stern and relentless. I eventually grew used to the standard procedures and complied notes of what to do at various stations and places in the pharmacy. This was my first experience working in an actually pharmacy, and I hope I can have coworkers that have as much personality and fortitude as the people I worked with here have."
good,Job was simple enough. manager was pleasant. Easy to interact with costomers. Stocking shelves was the main objective.
good,it was cold all year around i worked in a fridge temperature the co workers were great and it was very hard work we always stayed busy
good,it was a good job in two parts in the morning i worked as a greengrocer and the afternoon worked as a butcher. When required i worked on the shop floor filling stock and helping customers
good,"A typical day at work at Safeway is very productive. Providing great customer service and asking customers if they need help is a must, so you really have to love people and be very patient. Also, a lot of product and company policy knowledge is required."
good,Managers Are Very Rude.  But fellow Employees are nice. Hardest Part Was Putting Up With The Managers. Meeting New People Was Always Enjoyable.
good,"Typical day: greeting customers with a smile. Busy or slow on some days.  What I Learned: Continued to learn how to deal with customers that are not pleased with item prices and busy days. Management: Was fair and patient! Co-workers: we all got along well, help was given when needed. Hardest Part of Job: Customer's approach. The Most Enjoyable part of Job: The atmosphere, the music on the loud speaker, the co-workers and some friendly customers that come in to brighter my day with jokes and a smile and talking about a product."
good,I would make people coffee at starbucks i would have to remember the customers name and how to make thier drink. I would also fill in at different departments when somrone was out.
good,A great company to work for and great employees but many store managers ruin the experience. There is some room for advancement but not into management roles.
good,A typical day at work was to close the store. I have learned to have patience with the angry customers and how important it is to have a great team environment. Co-workers were great always worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was when we were down employees. The part I enjoyed most was the friendly environment and the team work that came with it. 
good,"A typical ranged from helping customers, to breaking down a grocery load, to stocking shelves all day long.  I learned so much about the retail business and how everything functions in this business.  I really enjoyed some managers, because some really knew how to motivate others and they were right there along side us working.  The hardest part about my job was having to multi-task alot of things at once.  I really enjoyed my fellow co-workers company, because I honestly felt like they were my second family."
good,"A day at work with the co-workers feels like spending time with family. The people there are all amazing and wonderful to work with. I have learnt a lot of things like how to do a specific job management has given you to do and how to provide good, quality  and equal customer service to every customer."
good,Job friendly work place. With good advancement. It has been good experience here.
good,Overall a fun place to work for. Enjoyed the people I worked with. Like being on your own getting the grocery orders filled.
good,"I learned how to manage a heavy workload as well as manage my time. Co-workers were generally great, and people usually worked well together. The hardest part of the job was just keeping track of all the various rules and guidelines, because they were constantly changing and sometimes the changes were not easy implemented. The best part of the job was being able to hep someone find what they need."
good,I had to bag groceries most of the time which got boring but I was able to interact with the customers. I learned how to make small talk with strangers because before working for safeway I was too shy to talk with strangers. My co-workers were nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job was cleaning messes outside of the building. The most enjoyable part of this job was interacting with new people.
good,"I liked working at Safeway for the most part, But Im looking for somewhere I can call a Career, and that I'll have more reliable hours so I can spend time with my family"
good,i wasnt there long due to moving back to ontario but i recommend working for safeway to everyone
good,"I worked for Safeway as an Assistant Manager and I learned a lot about the grocery side of retail. Overall it was a good experience to add to my resume. As an Assistant Manager the expectation is to work 6 days a week at about 55 to 65 hours a week. Your job duties consist of everything and potentially anything with in the store, from Cashiering on a regular basis to working in bakery or the deli if theyre short handed."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of arriving on time, clocking in, stocking shelves, rining up customers, and assisting customers with whatever help necessary."
good,It is a very good company to work for. The people are very friendly. You can learned new duties all the time. I get alone with all my co workers. We work as a team. It is a challege everyday is something different. I enjoy helping people when ever it is a need I help. I love to stay busy. Management is there to help when you need them.
good,great job hard work
good,"Safeway was a busy but fun place to work, at least the one i worked at was... I worked threw the night till the mornings, and was busy the whole time. I learned a-lot of skills that i can apply to my future. My co workers were all nice and friendly, and ranged in race and age, which i thought was cool. The most enjoyable part of my job was looking at the big load at the begining of the shift, and working your hardest threw the night to get it all out and looking nice for the customers in the morning."
good,"Overall a great place to work. The night stocker position is very physically demanding. Co-workers are nice, but you mostly stay to your own area during work hours."
good,"Safeway IT is demanding in the it sometimes requires you to work off hours and travel long distances. It was a steady job, usually having something on the go, with a few seasonal exceptions. The Safeway organization is very large so there is a lot of potential for both lateral and vertical movement within the organization."
good,You work 4days/10hr shifts. Lots of heavy lifting. Management wasn't too great but it was union so they were haters. People were just there for that money. LOVED the pay. You get almost $1 raise every year. You can make 70k/yr easy once you pass probation.
good,"The Bakery at Safeway was a wonderful place to work. I enjoyed learning to make bread, pastries,dounut,bagels, and various other Bakery items.A typical day was going in at 130 in the morning pulling and proofing all the bread,bagels,dounuts and pasties,have the french bread and dounts done buy 5am was the hardest part .Then i would check all the the tables for missing sale items, make a list and start baking. As far as co-workers and the Bakery manager we all got along well and She was very helpful about me get all my hrs."
good,Work hard to finish everything.
good,Managing at a company like safe way can be challenging at times but for the most part its a good company to work at i learned most of my management skills from Safeway.
good,safeway is a great company to start off at when youre first looking for a job however personally i wouldn't make it a career. the management at my store wasn't the greatest. plus it would always seem that i would end up working the late night shift then waking up the next morning and being there early which i didn't find very fair. my coworkers and the customers were for the most part great and were one of the main reasons why i got to work everyday but if i didn't have that i think i would've quit a long time ago. so like i said it's a great place to start but i wouldn't make it a career.
good,Would work there again. learned good teamwork and work ethics.
good,"My managers are supportive. I like the people I work with but it's not a career for me. It's just a starting job. I have learned a lot about people and how to work with the public, which is a good skill for me to take into future positions."
good,Typical grocery store. Stocking shelves. Making sure the customer found what they needed. It was a great job and paid well but I wanted to have a job with more potential to earn money.
good,"Working in a fast pace environment was great and I enjoyed it. I love helping and bagging long lines of groceries, made the time fly by."
good,"A day of work for me since I was all around would be, greeting customers, cleaning, taking orders, helping with schedule, making new products, keeping work area well stocked, etc"
good,"The hardest part of my job, is not working with the public. The hardest part is working with co-worker that dont appreciate or value having a job. They dont put any effort into moving forward. Majority of them dont even care how they can advance in a productive company."
good,"Making floral arangements, assisting shoppers cleaning, stocking, running the cash register! i learned how to make many arangements work a cash register as well as how to do inventory for certin departments. The management at highland safeway is great they are awesome fun loving people. they make you their top priority."
good,"Everyday at work was usually calm, not too slow, and fast on special occasions. Everyone was easy to get along with. A new manager came along and cut the hours very short which was not good for me. The hardest part was trying to keep up on holidays or gamedays when the store was crowded but the best part was knowing when I got my job done."
good,I enjoy working at Safeway. The employees are very nice. A typical day can start at 6 am organizing the sandwich bar to filling up the front case with all the meats and cheeses. I enjoy working with the public. I have alway had a front line job with great customer service. I think the hardest part of the job is having the Union.
good,Enjoyed working with fellow employees. Also enjoyed metting different customers Rotating and stocking shelves daily.
good,"Safeway will work you hard, deal with customers in poor or bad moods and maybe make one or two smile."
good,"Clock in on time, not early or late. required to take a lunch and breaks depending on hours worked on shift required by the union. learned that safeway is all about safety and fast pace. If your not fast detail oriented and safetey. these words are key during interview, safety first, customer service, fast and quick learner. hardest part is there is no actual life time. the hours fluctuate but your coworkers are mostly always fun especially the ones who have been there for years. management and culture depend on the store. sfaeway moves management around wquite a bit. so just when you think your used to a manager and you know his expected stardards they change the managment on you. when you first start you must sign up for the union. they will take initiation fees out slowly from your check so its not too traumatizing. just in case you get upset and not sure what the union is actually for they are like your lawyer. if you get accused of something or fired for any reason you call them.  they protect your rights forom getting screwed over. safeway has paid my bills for years but will screw you over if there was no union. i have been loyal to them for the last 7 years and as long as you work, dont call in unless your actually sick, and do what your supposed to do with a masmile youll be okay."
good,I passed the interview in 1 hour with hiring manager then I started work in two days. It was good experienced working their. I got to learn to learn good things.
good,"They send you out for a week's worth of training to learn defensive driving where you get certified. Those are real useful skills that you can use even in your daily driver vehicle. "
good,"Those that worked th were great people to work with. Store was managed well. Pay was good, but the local union gave me trouble. The initiation process online was very lengthy."
good,I liked most of my managers and they worked with my availability.  Sometimes we were understaffed. I enjoyed my time and would consider going back if I needed second job.
good,"Working for a big company like Safeway, you get a lot of aggravating customers. Working here tested my patience and has helped me grow as a person. It wasn’t all to fun but was a good work experience"
good,It is a regular cashier experience. You have to provide a lot of customer service. You need to be able to stand for a long period of time but there are 15 minute breaks every two hours of work.
good,Overall it was good however schedules needed to be out earlier and pay and hours needs to increase so that I may afford to live the work was hard but the people were fun to be around we reached our goals by working together
good,Some became family of Staff. Good Experience. Always Busy. Great First Job. Well benefits. Payed Weekly..Great foos and quality. Rewards and Gas Points are great.
good,I only worked in the deli department while at Safeway. I did not turn out to be a great fit for the deli department but in total my interactions with Safeway were positive.
good,"To keep it short, there will be days where it seems like the world is about to end; and others where it will be just fine. It depends on customers and who you're working with that day. Some of the managers and clerks are extremely rude and completely non-understanding of situations you could be in. Regardless, the company itself is great with you and its likely you will have a positive experience,"
good,"This was my first job, so it was great for teaching me how to navigate the professional world. I learned alot about customer service and how to complete tasks in a tight time frame."
good,I had a great experience working for the company. The management was very helpful. Would come back to work for the company again. Great company to work for
good,Es muy rapido el trabajo tienes que ir por carts y empacar y hacer la limpieza de la tienda pero al final tiene muy buen ambiente laboral
good,"I started at Safeway 2 years ago as a meat clerk. I gained experience in communications with customers and coworkers, alike. I wrapped meat and took orders for holiday roasts. I had entered the apprenticeship program at one time. I enjoyed the time, and will carry the knowledge with me to future occupations."
good,"Definitely a good starting job, learned a lot of customer service skills. This job taught me how to deal with tough customers in a kind, professional manner."
good,The stability and opportunities to rise in the company were outstanding. The flexibility to switch departments and different skills you're taught throughout the jobs are wonderful
good,I loved working as a teller and customer service clerk for safeway. It always kept me thinking on my feet helping customers. It taught me how to handle a high volume of problems while assuring customers. The friends I made there are some of the best relationships I've had in my life. The only difficult thing is holidays things can get outrageously busy but management does their best to keep employee morale high.
good,"My typical day at work is checking the cases to pull out all expired cakes/pastries and distress them.  Then I would look at my special orders and get them going.  Once that is done, I'm working on filling the cases based on the needed quantity in the sale report.  If the day start with needing buttercream/custard, I would make those first and label them with date and store them accordingly.  In addition to the routine, I also will have to prep for the following day or making backups so the store is ready for the busy weekend. Before the day is over, I will need to complete report and cleaning my working station."
good,"A fast paced work ethic with attention to customer service in a polite and efficient manner is an essential part of the job.There is always something to do, weather it`s production, customer aide or cleaning, to help the day not drag on forever. The feeling of accomplishment was always an enjoyable part of my job. I have been able to learn all aspects of my position to become a vital part of the team. I became a trainer and a person that my fellow employees felt I comfortable to approach me and ask for help, advice on procedures or recipes."
good,The community of people were great. It is a great place to gain retail experience. They take customer service seriously. It is a great place to shop as well.
good,"The customers are easy to talk to and are understanding, the employees are awesome, they help you with what u ever need and they help brighten the mood, if you need anything they will be there for you. it's easy to take the trash out bc u can a cart to gather it all and they have latex free gloves if you are allergic to latex. They pay attention to your health issues and what you are allergic to."
good,"This company moves glacially slow in change, everything is tested and retested to ensure the results at store level will be exactly as expected.  There is room for advancement if you are prepared to work for it advancing your skills and trying new things"
good,Been with safeway for near 5 years loved it was trained n developed to move forth skills atoned n sharped n area n ideas ready for my nxt job n position at my new job
good,"Your typical run-of-the-mill retail job. You have certain tasks that you are assigned by the supervisor, and sometimes asked by the store manager to do other tasks that sometimes may be a challenge, but in the end you gain experience doing so. The pay was good for a first job, and you gain a lot of customer service experience as you learn the ropes and interact with customers on a daily basis. There can be opportunities to move within the store to another department should an opening come up."
good,"Hired as Produce Manager, before 90 days was demoted to produce clerk due to inadequate training. Was never advised  how to do inventory. Only 2 weeks of training, the trainer didn't have time to train me so I had to try and figure it out myself. To many things to learn in that little bit of time"
good,"My tipacal day is bagging for costemers,"
good,Safeway was a fun atmosphere in a fast paced productive workplace. Coworkers worked together to get the job done. Pay was well including benefits for the work that was expected of their employees
good,Enjoyed that they were able to work a schedule with my schooling.Always would offer me more shifts . Gave me a strong foundation to work with people . I would have likedto advance to other departments but store will soon be closing.
good,"The job itself requires constant movement and being able to work independently as well as working with other. Being able to take instruction and execute the task given effectively. Management has always been good, any complaints I heard about management were very minor complaints or because of the individuals work ethic which is managements job to call out any inconsistencies they see. The people were amazing and is probably one of the best parts of the job."
good,"had fun while I was there, good people to work with for the most part. Management wasn't always the greatest but that's most places you go to work. Overall, wasn't bad."
good,"Was referred by a family member and was my first job. Good company to work for overall decent employee benefits, people were great while I was working there. Wages are fair. Union was nice I felt like I had decent job security."
good,"management sucked i was hired in a hiring event i worked for about two consistent months,as tey hired more people my hours began to dwindle.Eventually , my name wasnt on the schedules any more and so i assumed i was let go."
good,"Really enjoyed my time working at Safeway. Good atmosphere - was very fast paced which I enjoyed. Hot working conditions, but then again what kitchen isn't? Learned new recipes and the departments I worked in had great teamwork. The management in my department was pretty good however the GM (at the time) was very difficult to get along with and didn't  communicate very well. I would love to go back to this company, but with a ""misunderstanding"" in how I left I don't believe it is a possibility. If you have the chance to work there - go for it!"
good,I worked in deli but wanted to learn everything I could. I do miss my job and need to work on obtaining employment at this point in time and would appreciate to utilize my skills
good,"Loved working at this store. Great all-around environment. I had the pleasure of running a great grocery crew. The store manager just sat in his office all day until he needed to come out and yell at someone!! But at least my crew made my job a delight, though!!"
good,"The workplace itself can become a bit stressful, however you do have to maintain your end of the job. It is easy to become behind when not staying focused."
good,"I was very committed and loyal to Safeway for thirteen years, I stayed TIL closing store in mission, then transferred to maple ridge Safeway and worked TIL closing that store"
good,"This was my first job and it really opened my eyes to the responsibilities of a working man. I had to learn the store in and out to provide ultimate customer satisfaction. I also had to make sure the store was clean and organized in general as compared to the individual sections. the hardest part of the job, in all honesty, was go-backs. As it tested your knowledge of the store and how efficient you can work. But the most enjoyable part of working here, in my opinion, was bagging and helping the customers directly."
good,"Safeway is an outstanding company in terms of pay, consistency in hours, and flexible scheduling.  They do a great job at maintaining a constant work schedule based on your availability.  The Union is good to the extent of benefits, but in my opinion enabled lazy workers as well as lack of punishment to those who were rude to customers and fellow co workers.  The culture at Safeway is that you are either apart of a group of coworkers or you are not, there is no in between."
good,Safeway is a good place to work but a more stable environment is what I need right now. I don’t like the inconsistency. You want to feel secure in a work place and that was not the case here.
good,Was a decent place to work. Had three separate pay raises and advancements. If I hadn't moved away for college I probably would've been a mananger for Safeway by now if not running my own location.
good,"Our store was understaffed where we only had 4 deli clerks. I tried to join as much as I could as it was a high school job. they treated me great and as a human. I worked there for a year and a half and left when our manager quit and was replaced, the union started taking 50$ a week and my fiancee was mad she never saw me. Great place to start a career just be ready to be turned down as I did."
good,A typical day at work consisted of performing our routine tasks and stocking items on shelves. Management is always able to assist both customers and employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is to interact with and help customers.
good,"Very nice work culture,coworker were helpful,bust too far frome iran.i start work there as a part time during my first 2 years at school,then i was full time worker last 2 years."
good,"The schedule was accommodating  enough that I was able to continue my education, but I definitely couldn't see myself there for a long period of time."
good,"I enjoyed it, my co-workers were great, hours were easier changed and swapped when needed. The management was a bit iffy. I also got charged union fee as a part-time high schooler which took a good chunk of my check."
good,Manager the over operations of store. The store is fast pace. Had to be able to complete different jobs throughout the store. To be able to work in each department.
good,My days at work was good sometimes I didn't learn much there was helping people with their  groceries working out side in snow and cold and cleaning up
good,easy job duties. learned how to cut fruits and vegetables. Management is supportive and understand if you try to talk to them about your problems. breaks are the most enjoyable part in this job.
good,Safeway is a good company that was bought out by another company.  With recent management changes safeway has became a better company to work for.  Their MGMT program and training is done really well.
good,They offer flexible scheduling. Employees were nice. Management was not so great. I asked for more hours multiple times and I never got it. Sometimes customers were rude.
good,"The job was pretty relaxed, costumers were decent. The job itself made me feel like I wasn’t going anywhere honestly..The wages were pretty okish for California."
good,Not all employees were concerned about the customers.  Good days and bad days. Fast paced job. Gets busy a lot. Some days it gets stressful. But over all its good for a first time job.
good,Working with Safeway was fun when we had a good store manager.  I started off as a Deli clerk then got promoted to work in the customer service department and pay raise 3 months of working. After the 3 months working in the customer service department I got another pay raise for doing a good job and putting effort in working. I also got offered to become a grocery manager but declined because I really wasn't ready for the responsibility. Everything was fun while it lasted.
good,The work was productive and steady. The people that worked there were wonderful and always nice. Everyone was helpful and treated with respect. It was also nice to have regular customers that come in.
good,"A typical day on the Night Crew at Safeway consists of clocking on and letting the night checker out to take over for them. If not checking, pulling the boards out from the back to put on the floor to break them down is what I would be doing. After breaking down the boards it is typically 1 A.M, when we close the store. "
good,Just a average checking job. You have your ups and downs based on customers. General pretty good experience can get crazy durring holiday but that's about normal.
good,Loved working with safeway. The only reason I left was due to my transfer falling through when we moved to washington state. Look all management teams have good and bad team members. I have been lucky to have a majority of the good ones.
good,"I like working there for many reasons, they provide some good benefits, and I like helping people and satisfate their demand daily. In addition, I built a strong relationships with a lot of customres who like my services and my behavior."
good,"I enjoyed my role at Safeway, the only reason I left was because the company moved offices giving me a 62 mile each way commute.  Annual reviews with increases based on performance."
good,"When I worked in the Deli. It would go from slow to very quickly paced depending on the time of day. "
good,"I enjoyed working for Safeway, I was a Deli manager which was a very fast paced environment. Good management and they talked to you about solutions if there were problems"
good,Pay was extremely low for Seattle area average cost of living was based on 18+ an hour. They start you off at 12 per hr. They needed to review the cost of living in area to how much they pay.
good,Being a grocery home shopper was one of the neatest jobs I've ever had. I started around 5am and worked usually at least 8 hours. We had monitors with customers orders with a scanner attached to a cart; and then from there we'd go around and scan each item that was on a list.
good,I worked for this company for almost 12 years. It was a flexible job where I worked nights and my husband days so we could avoid childcare expenses. I decided to leave when my youngest started kindergarten.
good,It was always busy and we were short staffed. Could of had better management but overall people were friendly. Learned a lot from working at  Safeway.
good,"Still enjoy coming to work after 12 years of service   "
good,"I was required to pull a certain number of orders per day.  This kept me engaged in the position.   There was repetitive heavy lifting.  There were good opportunities for pay raises.  However,  it was somewhat dangerous."
good,It was a fun environment to work. Customers were interesting. Management was usually understanding. The uniforms have become much more lax since I worked there.
good,"I was at a very busy store so even as a part time employee I could get up to 38 hrs in a week. Requesting time off was easy but not paid. You have to put time in before you get paid vacation. Would recommend for entry level, particularly students starting in the workforce."
good,"Loved this job for a few years, however, became too mundane."
good,Overall experience at Safeway was good. People were to work with. Customers were always grateful for assistance. Short staffed so clerks were always doing several tasks when register clerks needed assistance the most. Flexibility wasn’t as stated before hiring.
good,"I enjoyed the environment immensely, the employees were often very nice and helpful. Hardest part was having to man the kiosk all by myself for 6 hours. This was very tough and exhausting."
good,A good company and people to work with. Very routine same thing every day. Gave opportunities to move up in the company.  Good benefits for employers.
good,Safeway is a really good company to work for. Competitive wages and excellent benefits. I worked in the Produce area. Facility is very well maintained for ias long as its been there. Management wesn't the best though.
good,Working with Safeway Starbucks was a really fun experience for me I loved being a barista it was really slow in the evening time so I was mostly just cleaning and stocking for the next day but when I got rushes I loved the fast pace work.
good,I was a little 18 year old girl going through tough times and they were there for me. I wish I wouldn't have left because I'd probably be in a management position by now.
good,"This job alternates often between a fast paced and slow paced environment. Overall, I learned how to proficiently serve customers needs, keep an organized workplace, and organize and stock merchandise. The most enjoyable part of my job was serving customers and doing hands on labor."
good,"A typical day working at Safeway as being a courtesy clerk was helping costumers most of the day. Bagging up their groceries, helping costumers locate items and bringing all the shopping carts up to the front of the store."
good,"The job is what you make of it.  If you do your job you are set, if you don't then you can get let go.  The management will work with you on certain  things but if it gets out of hand you loose hours and have to start at the bottom again."
good,As a grocery bag man it was always fun to meet new people everyday and help anyone in need to their car with their groceries. good place to work when your peers are a good hard workers
good,"Good, although it has had.many changes and feel the wage increases do not reflect growth.  There is some hard to achieve goals that are set on a daily basis and just not enough workforce to make happen."
good,I take safeway as being a company that can and will fit the employees' schedule in mind (even though it is unionized). Those stores that are opened 24/7 is very encouraging because of the hours.
good,This was a really great experience working here. I not only advanced quickly but I made great friends.  Mostly of the people st Safeway’s are friendly and helpful. Great people.
good,"It was a fast paced job, usually never at a stand still. Duties of each position is very well organized and easy to understand. Management is fairly well (Hilo)"
good,"A good and friendly company to work for, great colleagues that are always willing to help and get stuck into the tasks that need doing. A good management team."
good,"The job itself was fine, the manager was great, too. But, due to other employees being inconsistent with arrival time it made my life a lot harder as there had to be a lot of rescheduling throughout the week."
good,"While good for a student job, it can be occasionally stressful, because of lack of staff. Likewise, raises are earned by spending more time there, and then it's very little. PICs only make an extra dollar as compared to minimum wage staff, so there is very little incentive to do better, or increase responsibilities."
good,Safeway is a good company to work for. They pay decent wages and provide excellent health benefits. There is a good chance for advancement in the grocery industry.
good,"Working during the day, you spend a lot of time packing up items and putting them on the shelves. If you work later though, you have to wash everything, but if you get done early there is not much else to do. I found myself a lot of the time just staring at the shopping floor and looking for something to sweep."
good,"It was a great job, I loved it, it get boring after awhile standing in one spot or even doing jobs that the booth clerks are supposed to be doing.  They keep you busy while they can take their time."
good,Its exactly how it looks if you're there grocery shopping. Either you have work to do or you stand in front of the cash register your entire shift....
good,"a day at safeway is stocking, helping people pack to there car. getting carts. the fun part that i liked is stocking and helping pack there stuff to there car; what i learn is leadership skill, bagging, stocking"
good,Typical place to work. Hours are limited but it is fun to work with people. Be prepared to work holidays and weekends. Nights are chill and easy going.
good,"The hardest part of the job depends on where you work, I would not recommend being a cashier doesn't seem fun from what I've seen, just saying. But I would recommend fruit cutter position."
good,"Like many other grocery positions, Safeway is a relatively decent job but is often plagued by poor management, ineffective unions, and static pay. However, the experience varies greatly from store-to-store, as upper management doesn't interact with store employees too much."
good,Used to be a good place to work but has gone down over the last few years. Union is weak. Management is a sucker to corporate. They don't protect their employees.
good,Sometimes it get's really busy and some days are slow. It's fun but sometimes in can get stressful when don't have the help and when someone calls out.
good,"typical day at work would be busy depends on what time of the day it was, management was alright and the hardest part was doing more things then your job description was."
good,Very hard and busy job that I had . Was responsible for many aspects related to my job. Was very stressful st times and more work than one person could do. Responsible fir getting stock fir the freezer in the deli which was a huge responsibility with little time to do this task
good,Working at a grocery store is a never ending job that requires quick fulfillment of repetitive tasks while accomplishing customer service. It requires a fast pace and a service first attitude.
good,"Productive place of work, customers were nice, co-workers were generally nice, work was sufficient, pay was great and days in working with others was fundamental for job experience"
good,This job gets repetitive but it is simple at least.  Theres always something to do but it's not really that difficult or challenging so it can be easy but also kinda lame at the same time.
good,Iwould serve customors at the till and I loved doing that because I Could here about other peoples day and cheer them up if they were feeling down. I also learned to be positive to others if they are having a bad day.
good,"In the corporate office there is defiantly a click mentality, if you don;t fit in with the upper management then you are outcast and less likely to be promoted with in. The individual offices are run a bit unprofessional, but overall the training is good."
good,"Safeway offered a good place to work and get experience with customer service and coming out of your shy blanket. the most physical part of the job was breaking down the delivery loads and stocking the shelves. You learn the customers who are regulars and develop that good relationship with them, and sometimes the occasional customer that doesn't know what they want to do for dinner it felt good the give them some ideas."
good,Working at Safeway was the same as any other cashier job I had had. Although after a while I got to know the regulars and that made it more fun when they knew who you were and you could actually have a conversation with them The people I worked with were always kind and I didn't have an issue until the day I quit
good,"My time at Safeway I learned how to work with customers how to problem-solve and also how to be a very multi-task person.  Safeway is a chain grocery store and it is very busy it will keep you busy they always have employment which is very good you will never be out of work and it's very good if you're going to school because they have hours"
good,"It can get stressful, i can multitask it helps me get things done quicker.I couldn't trust other employees there. They would back stab you in an instant."
good,"Pulling out load up to 1500 to 700 pieces, unloading it, then stocking items to the sales floor, then facing the store after stocking, the hardest part of the job is when you have to cover other people slack like when you have 15 aisle in the store and your doing half of the store stocking, and facing with a core group of 5 to 6 people"
good,A typical day at work is usually busy and hardworking. I've learned to move fast and how to handle situations with customer service. Management was great when I was first hired because she was able to work with my school schedule. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with many different people and helping others.
good,"The management is somewhat hard to deal with. The co-workers make it easier to work with however, I just worked as a part-time so my judgement might be different had I been a full-time"
good,"Great job to get back on your feet, but not a good job to have as a life long career. My hours were always irregular and I never got a full 30 hours a week, 24 hours doesn't pay my bill so I needed to go elsewhere."
good,Used to be good to work for but then staff hours while number of customers increased had made it undesirable. I dislike the secret shoppers evaluations (waste of time).
good,"On a work day it was very fast and time just flew by."
good,working Safeway deli is a headache some customers don't care how much you have to do or can't understand that sometimes items run out and us as employees don't have authority to do certain things. Other than that its very fast passed
good,To work here you need to find the right store with the right people I always tell people safeway if they are looking. I loved working at safeway in highschool
good,"At safeway, some days were definitely better than others. Shifts with people who made the job fun but were still organized and focussed made the time go by quicker. Some staff were very strict and a lot of the time for no good reason so that sometimes made going to work stressful and dreadful. Overall, being employed there was not that bad and i appreciate the managers and fellow employees who helped me learn so much."
good,"Each day was fairly similar. Do your work and go home. Maybe socialize a little. I learned not to share too much personal info because people like to talk. Overall a good place to work although a bit unprofessional. Hardest part was others socializing and not focusing on work, making my workload increase. I did however enjoy the friendly workers and customers."
good,"Don't get me wrong, Safeway gave me a great first job that lasted a little over 2 years. It was great but over my time there, people complained more than anything else. Employees complained, customers complained."
good,"Working graveyards as a grocery/food clerk can be great if you are on the food clerk scale. I always got around 40hrs a week and it adds up quick toward the next tier for payment within the union (every 1040hrs you go up a tier, that's twice a year at 40hrs per week). "
good,"I started work here while at last year of school. Good company, "
good,"The Safeway I work at is a Productive work enviroment with unadequate wages to prices today in my local area, my wage is 11.10 /hr working about 20ish hours a week"
good,advancement is based on hours worked so it takes a while to get to your next pay grade when you work part time but it's not a bad job if you're motivated
good,"I enjoyed working with co-workers whom were much older than I am, I aspire to be as professional and driven as them. They truly make you feel welcomed, and will take care of you as a new member of the team. Understandings when it comes to flexibility and work hours, and awesome management!"
good,I did. I worked in just about every department and helped almost everyone in the store. There was nothing I couldn't do and I still felt unfairly paid and noticed. Safeway under utilizes it's best employees and leaves them by the wayside.
good,"I believe in this company ,and had a chance to gain a career opportunity in a world franchise that has provided serves to million of people. With the professional attitude of greeting a diverse ethic of people. Being productive in a routine schedule of job duties that provided compliance with standard rules and regulation."
good,Work will be hard if you slack. Keeping a good pace will give you an advantage over others. management will find something for you to do if you are just standing around and those tasks will suck the most. Working with others will make the day go easier for you and those other.
good,"Company was going through a merger, cut labor too much to make bottom line look good.  Benefits were excellent.  Needed more staffing, pharmacist working alone is dangerous all around."
good,"Overall Safeway is a good company, however at our store Management does not do much to take care of you as an employee. He was sympathetic to personal needs but within the work place there is a lot of sub par equipment to lack of spending to make things efficient and safe."
good,The company was a good one to work for. The pay was good and the hours were long. The pay for per diem was good also. I learned many things from the people I worked for.
good,"Typically good work days but changes are a constant; hardly a day is the same with daily orders change on how much sales are in 1 item or group. Frequent changes in salads or sandwiches based on sales. Supervisors are awesome. Management is not a personal get to know everyone type; all I knew was their name. Workplace culture loved working with everyone in my shift , all good people. The hardest part is the fact that graveyard shift didn't work for my body adjustment in sleep behaviors and family life."
good,"I worked two locations of Safeway pharmacy. One location was very chaotic, some people working, some people setting.  Another one, everyone knows what means term work, and the manager knows how to work with different characters."
good,I came in made coffee and worked with customers face to face which I enjoyed. the management didn't relay information to everyone just other management or would forget but other than that everyone else was friendly and caring. the hardest part would be management but the most enjoyable would be working with the customers and learning the regulars and getting to know them on a personal level and creating new friends while working
good,"It is always something different at Safeway. It's a great environment. Great employees. Awesome customers. They have alot to offer , they have a great floral selection."
good,"It was a job that there was a great deal of travel. I loved this kind of physical work and was very good at it. My co workers did not like my efficiency because I often got done ahead of schedule, causing the job to be completed early. Sometimes causing co workers to loose money. Good for company."
good,"Was a good job, good people. Just not enough money to have a family, so I went somewhere else where I could start out at the top end wages you would end at in Safeway."
good,i learned how to order new products and deal with customer problems they might have. I also learned how certain departments are ran and how to run them
good,"Great company to work with if you don't want to advance. At 4 years in, I am at the top of my available pay scale. Just 4 years. Management is okay, they were better before the merge with Albertsons. Pay is good for my department, only real reason I haven't left already."
good,Safeway is a good company to work for if you are looking for part time work. If you are a student Safeway will work around your school schedule.  Safeway has great health care benefits.
good,"Safeway is a great place to work to either start out or lead into retirement. "
good,Enjoyed working here lots of great co-workers and had a fun experience. Was not extremely stressful. learn lots of new skills and there was plenty of opportunities to advance or change departments if wanted.
good,"Safeway was a nice place to work.  I had a not so nice manager at the time of my departure, but otherwise it was good.  I would recommend working there."
good,"Safeway is a fast paced job and I meet a lot of people. The time goes really fast and the job is not hard on your back. There is a bit of lifting and sorting, but as long as i am busy that's ok. I got to listen to music because i worked at night"
good,The job in its own was my very first and do thought saying it went amazing and they loved me I've got no beef with Safeway only with the working community but they vary and they are normally okay but can be disrespectedful and that not okay they need to shape up and become better people
good,"Not a bad place to work, there is potential for advancement if you intend to put in the extra hours and show the desire to work hard. Some coworkers have a touch experience and would say negative things, but that is with any job. I suggest just doing what is required and not getting mixed up in the drama."
good,A typical day at work would normally include me and an employee higher up on the payroll working together. They have a strict no working alone policy.
good,"During my position at Safeway I started off as a Deli Clerk and quickly advanced to Assistant Manager.  During my time as Assistant Manager I was promised a raise and did not get that raise. I however did learn how to stock, count, and order more products for the shelves. I also experienced a lot of good people while working with Safeway co-workers and customers of all different types. It was a great experience."
good,Cutting hours and adding more requirements. I love who I work with but it's hard when corporate keeps adding requirements but cutting hours. I love what I do.
good,Working the whole time but not a bad thing. Keeps you busy and makes it go  by fast. Great people and customers everyday. Employees very polite and stick together.
good,"As someone who entered the work force for the first time at Safeway, I will say that the benefits and pay were not too bad and there were chances to move up in the company. At times, management was not entirely willing to work with my schedule, but it was rare that there were any big issues. Generally, my coworkers were respectful and positive and it was a good experience. Sometimes the work can be physically demanding/unpleasant depending on the department. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,"My day would consist of food preparation, e-mail checks and ad planning. The most enjoyable part to the job was my co-working staff. The store manager was also a concerned leader who made the company run more smoothly because of his show of appreciation."
good,"shifts rotate which is good if you like change, you can be cross trained, you can advance in your department. you can learn new skills. pay isn't good.. at all. but you work with family friendly people. and you will enjoy the work you do. the hardest part is having this as your primary job, with the low pay. the most enjoyable part is the customers are real people and also the your associates."
good,"a typical day at work is dealing with customers lines, complaints, and business. Working the cash register is nice if you are a people person. you have to have patience"
good,"serving customers, prepping food, clearing tables. management was ok. good place to have fun in the staff room. down to earth people. hardest part was long hours to make ends meet. the staff made the job more enjoyable"
good,It was mean to an end as far as working here. The management wasn't the best at making the right decisions but the job itself helped me get through undergraduate school onto my B.A. program which is where i am at right now. It helped me pay my bills but it made me realize i have further extensive career goals and interests. Thank you.
good,"Good times, worked for a year and half. Started as a courtesy clerk and moved to cashier. It was a little difficult to manage school/work, not very flexible hours. Management barely showed appreciation."
good,"the job was simple as a courtesy clerk, which basically meant i had janitorial duties and bagging. after that i became a checker which was ok, part of me missed walking around but the hours were better. overall consensus I enjoyed it."
good,Safeway management can be very flexible to work with your schedule. Unfortunately schedules are only posted weekly and if you don't have high seniority you can work all different hours  throughout a week. The staff is very nice and all together a fun work environment.
good,Like any retail job it can be very stressful. The job is a great beginner job and you can advance quickly if you want to stay in the grocery Industry.
good,"	Distribution and coordination of transportation services"
good,"> Theres an increase with in six months of working"
good,When a first started at safeway I was afraid to be judged due to my autism so I refrained from making any mention to it. After a year I let the store manager know and nothing changed. Over 2.5 years I learned the skills needed to run a dairy department with the company and was asked if I wanted to run my own. if I was able I would go back to that same work culture.
good,"Thank Goodness."
good,"Both jobs are physically demanding. Have to be able to bend, lift, carry and/or push carts from the lot. In produce you cut fruits and veggies daily for sale on the sales floor. It a process of making things easier for the customer for their home life. With Courtesy Clerk you serve customers on front end, from greeting to bagging their groceries to taking them to their car and loading car. You retrieve carts from the lot on 1/2 hr basis on hot days. I have to say I enjoyed the people I met while working here. Most are family friendly."
good,"All of my coworkers were friendly, but management was awful. Schedules were often posted late, then abruptly changed. Manager always had a kind of rude/condescending tone."
good,"Very busy at times,learned a lot about everyday store operations. Co-workers were like family and we always pulled together to get things done as a team.I enjoyed keeping busy and learning new things daily to be able to give the best service to our customers."
good,Very high paced job.  Management was the hardest to adjust to.  always wanting something different.  The work was fine as long as had the employees needed other wise very stressful.
good,Mostly if your looking to make a lot of money here's the place use to get plenty of over time but cut back recently overall good paying job good people
good,"Sign in, cut & display meat to be sold. made grind of lean to fatty."
good,Good company to work for but not as big of a footprint in the retail pharmacy space as say a Walgreens or CVS.  Limited locations means limited advancment if thats is something you are looking for.
good,"I enjoyed my work as a pharmacy technician at Safeway, because it was fairly straight forward and simple. The worst was talking to insurance companies and angry patients."
good,"Very good company to work for...they even sent me to blow molding school to refine my troubleshooting skills...lots of overtime  because of people calling off...spent many Friday and Saturday nights covering for my union brothers. Lots of rebuild time on the weekends...welded in a heat exchanger/ 14 hours until the job was done...had to be ready Monday morning for production to run. My positive attitude ...""can do""helped a lot on this job!"
good,It was a good place to work but at the same time it was consistently understaffed. Management was fair and people were friendly. I realize that they had to cut hours for a reason but being the only courtesy clerk on call meant some of my responsibilities weren't always fully attended to.
good,It was a good place to work but there is no room for advancement since most people who are on top have been working there fir 30 years + who don't want to retire.
good,Management is often under stress and may tend to operate in ways inefficient to the company and or employees affected. Poor scheduling and pay discrepancies have been an issue for many including myself.
good,Not a bad place if you need a job. Spent all day in back cutting fruit so not much change. Great time management skills are easy to pick up. Management doesn't mess with you much
good,"At safeway, there really was not much to do. So it was not to bad, the management was nice, but some stuff they did was annoying like making men clean shaved."
good,"Overall, this was not my favorite job I have had. It was very busy almost all day. I came to work and went straight to work there wasnt much of talking to other employees, I got there and did my own thing."
good,A typical day as a courtesy clerk mainly consist of maintaining a clean work space. I've learned how to manage my time. The hardest part of the job is being called for assistance while trying to complete a task.
good,"Hired as a checker and currently in the bakery, I find Safeway to be fun and busy. I'm learning different things on a near daily basis.  My time in the bakery is full of things to do, so time goes by fast.  My main responsibilities are packaging product, placing on the sales floor, bakery sales, cake orders, checking and supply coordinator."
good,"Not a bad place to work all things considered.  The work life balance could be a bit rough, but once you begin to climb the ladder the compensation is enough to offset any other issues."
good,"Expectations and standards are high. Extremely strict labor budgets and union contracts keep management's hands tied. That being said, the job is what you make it and there are lots of opportunities for advancement for those with the drive."
good,"I worked night stalker and I enjoyed my work and the other employees there. I would go back to work for them any time. "
good,"i would have to help customer with getting food or making them a sandwich, i would have to clean after the space i used, restocking all the inventory item that came through the deli."
good,"A typical courtesy clerk is a high school college age person. Our duties would be collecting carts, cleaning up messes, helping people to their cars and activities that follow that same suit. Not much room to advance to another position because when one becomes available they tend to hire from outside."
good,The work was easy and fast paced. Co workers weren't always friendly and turned their nose to new people. The deli manager encouraged drug use which caused me to switch departments. Night crew was amazing and management was always on top of things.
good,Customer Service Based Retail Establishment with positive energy and a Successful Raport with its customers and employees. Fast Advancement at the Retail Level.
good,"Working in stock and cake decorating, Bread slicing in the morning, packaging and putting out fresh stock with first in first out rotation."
good,"Great company to work for but Safeway was closing the store I worked at, so I decided to look for other employment. I loved working  with people, people are pretty much always happy when they have food on their mind.  My job wasn't hard at all."
good,This was a great company and I would have stayed however when Albertsons took over the company changed as well as a lot of the structures that were in place causing it to effect my home life and my time with my kids.
good,Not too thrilled with working at Safeway again. A lot to do in the service desk yet only one person works at a time because they really don't have anyone. Management likes to keep close eye on every. Sometimes feels like they are trying to find a way to write you up.
good,"Enjoyed working here, co-workers were friendly, a lot of management was nice except for a few. Customers are usually seniors in Lynn Valley and are easy going and nice to talk to. The store is a bit old and needs a bit of a touch up, but I'm sure the seniors appreciate the old timey feeling it gives."
good,Working at safeway meant a lot of time on your feet and working at a fast pace. Most customers just want to get their groceries and leave as quick as they can so that meant me bagging their groceries and quick and neatly as i could as well as walking them out to their car. Safeway managers always felt that it was best everyone got along making our days go faster and making it a cooperative work environment.
good,"Busy location. Fun customers, fast paced most of the time, and plenty of advancement opportunities. Training was deep and detailed for all positions. Knowledgeable staff."
good,I loved working in the deli where I learned a great deal and started to excel. I definitely recommend it to whoever likes working with a good company and its customers.
good,"fun environment, but lots of lazy people who are protected by union. most work is done by a small group of people while others are slow to move. Could have been fixed with better managment"
good,"a typical day consisted of customer service and food preparation per order specifically tailored to each individuals needs, I also operated all food preparation machines as needed and severed meals accordingly"
good,"Great people to work with; "
good,"Only worked there for a few months, but overall there was a lot to do to keep you on your feet. Also came with hour long breaks, so that was nice. Management had questionable beliefs at times, though the coworkers were always nice and appreciative."
good,I have worked for safeway for a while and it was productive and busy especially during the holidays. The works I had worked with some were nicer than others and the managers were understanding. However it is fast pacing so if you can't work face pace then it's not for you.
good,"The Safeway experience was a great learning experience in world class customer service I learned how to manage the produce section, and helps customer with finding there shopping needs. I bagged groceries,learned their sweep log system, and gained some meat department experience bagging and weighing meat as well as assisting customer all over the store. If I didn't know to do something I found someone who, which taught to be resourceful or learn thing on the fly."
good,"A typical day consisted of prepping, packaging and putting meat on the shelves for consumption. You would ring up customers at the counters. In the mornings you would break down the packages of meat."
good,"After your probationary period (200 hours), you feel secure in your job. Raises are awarded according to hours worked, which add up fast if you are full time or cover shifts frequently."
good,"it was my first job and with no experience working( at all) it was a excellent introduction to not only the retail industry but working in general. employees were amazing and are still some of my best friends today. management at the time was not great but i believe its been resolved. overall, not bad for a people person, but i warn you there is a lot of resolving almost humorous customer issues and complaints and the jokes become less funny down the line."
good,"I worked this job while I was still in community college. At the time, I really enjoyed working here. A lot of fellow coworkers were good friends,and we would work together often, making the hours go by that much faster. The average work day was from 2 to 10, as the deli was one of the last departments to close. The equipment around the deli was all easy to use. The hardest days to work were Fridays, as that was the day all the special sales happened. These days were very busy and we would usually run out of sale items and be forced to substitute other similar product. My only real complaint was the department was micromanaged by the higher-ups when I worked there. This could cause some issues when we knew what was best for our department versus what they wanted. Overall, the job is fine and it was a good work experience for me."
good,"Safeway was a great company to work for. Working in the Starbucks kiosk, it was always upbeat and fun. I made great relationships and had awesome reviews from my customers."
good,"A typical day at work involves helping many dozens of different people with their groceries. I've learned cash handling and customer service skills, as well as how to work hard in a fast paced work environment. A lot of the people I work with, including management, are friendly, helpful and do their job well."
good,"Too many bosses trying to control inventory,  not considering payroll limits"
good,"I would get work around twenty minutes before my shift to walk around and get feel for the store at the time. Next I would stay up front and check for about two hours, this would be followed by a break after this I would on my daily tasks (putting away freight, setting floor displays, restocking key items.) In addition I would make sure all departments maintained necessary levels of service after the Manager had left for evening. On Saturdays I after 9:00 pm I would wear two hats and also be the bookkeeper in addition to supervisor duties."
good,I thought that working at Safeway was a very rewarding and interesting experience that showed me how to properly help people
good,"Great Manager, Great co workers, good customers, learned great stress management techniques. fast pace. declining available hours. high turn over rate."
good,Great people to work with. Good Customers.  Management works to meet schedule request.  However it is difficult to plan outside activities when schedule for following week isn't posted until Thursday PM and no reasonable insurance of what days off you will have.
good,"It was a lot of work to be honest, so much to do there, I was never bored. I learned a lot about cooking, deli meats/cheeses, and costumer service skills. I formed friendships with pretty much all of my costumers because in that environment you have to work together to get things done. management was bad until my assistant manager took over then everything was a lot better. I had problems with management that was higher up though, they would add more and more stuff for us to do when we were already struggling with what we had to do, it felt like they didn't even bother to understand the employees that actually did the work. The part I really liked about the job was either working early and making production and being able to have a quiet part of my day. also you get a discount on groceries."
good,Current work is more physically demanding. Quite strenuous considering the nature of the business. I enjoy working with several employees and find it more interesting to be acquainted with different people. I end my day knowing at least that i get to serve our customers with satisfaction and leave my work with a SMILE just as when i got started.
good,physically demanding and rewarding job.  I only want to leave because there is not many opportunities for growth and development past the stage I am already at.
good,"Safeway is a family oriented facility, every employee there treats one another like family. I appreciate the weekly paychecks."
good,I did great work with this company and had a great relationship with all the employees in different departments and worked as hard as I can to keep me and the company moving forward. unfortunately when the big Safeway Albertsons merge came around they no longer cared on what I needed done as frozen manager to complete the company change and order all that I needed was necessary as I tried to get through this change in my department management pulled me away to help other departments witch was never a problem with me because I knew since I work fast I can catch up quick until every time I had a minute to get my department ready I was rudely asked to  keep doing everything but my own department. I got yelled at for trying to make everything work for the best of everyone else and when I asked for help in y department since they wanted so much for other departments I got a no every time
good,A nice place to be. Not much advancement where I was but I like dealing with customers & the hours were good. Working for the company was good. Ok Managment.
good,"Safeway is exceptional at working with your schedule to give you the time you need if you are going to school or have children. "
good,very friendly staff ready to help where i am needed and take on any shifts when called respecting my team members and customers with there shopping experience
good,"Safeway was a very forward thinking organization in terms of policies and procedure's, such as Sarbanes Oxley as well as the Five S program.									"
good,Worked there 11 yrs. Only reason not there is because the plant closed. Great people to work with.. Hated the plant had to close
good,"Enjoyed multiple interactions with all kinds of people, easy schedule/job expectations, union support, management was friendly."
good,"A usual day would start with me taking over the produce section of the store from the daytime manager, after he left I would begin facing up the produce while helping customers, after I had faced up the produce I would spend time in the store room and the freezer making sure the areas were clean and the produce was neatly stored, while checking the back store room I would also take an inventory of the items that we had while making notes of the items that would need to be ordered the following week.  While doing all of this I would also go assist at the front check stands when needed."
good,"got along great with my boss.  Loved working with the public and making the customers feel like I was there just for them.  Since I worked at the Safeway on the coast, and there weren't any other grocery store chains like ours, we had a lot of regulars that would come in and request certain people to help them.  I seemed to have a lot of regulars.  It was a very pleasant place to work."
good,Very busy place. lots of multi-tasking. work with great employees. hardest part of the job is when the system is down or super slow. What I enjoy about this job is knowing that customers are happy about their service that they are looking for.
good,"customers were friendly, Management was good to work/learn with. Hardest part of job would be some of the older employees not liking change in the company. Best part of the job was making new friends"
good,"It was a great place to work for twenty years and they gave me important skills that I can use and grow with as I move on. The atmosphere was, for the most part, great. Safeway had great diversity that really improved the job culture."
good,"This safeway was a slow pace pharmacy where only 2 technicians and 1 pharmacist work all day. It is a Union job and thats what i didnt like, they took out money from our paychecks but didnt take care of us."
good,Safeway is a good place for a new worker who would like to learn about the retail sector.  Union job with high job security and good advancement for those with the drive and initiative.  Pay starts off low but does eventually provide a living wage.  Hours start off low as well but as your seniority rises your hours maximize eventually. Best to start when a student or to have management goals quickly
good,Enjoyed working with supportive supervisors that were willing to show how a job is to be completed by illustrating hands on. I enjoyed working with other employees and adapted to their good personalities and commitment. But I had a small problem with the need of urgency  in the company with at times being pushed to  a very fast paced with unfamiliarity being an issue.
good,"working at Safeway was a great experience i learned a lot meet new friends, safeway was a great place to work. i enjoyed engaging with the costumers, some were nice and some were mean but over all it was very fun"
good,"Safeway is like any other grocery store, but focuses on customer service over anything else. All of the departments put concentration into serving the customers and fulfilling their needs."
good,work starts with making every thing in the bakery. then you deal with you can not make me work faster or I will call union. then you have mostly good people that need your help
good,Staff is friendly. Customers are nice for the most part. Co-workers are ot hard to talk to. Schedule is mostly flexible.
good,"It was a safety conscious environment. Dependable for hours. You could work full time but not claim full time only part time, therefore benefits were a severely limited option. Hard work demanding, friendly employees."
good,"Make sure all product is on the shelf, proper personnel is assigned for that days sales. Daily paperwork is complete, shrink is maintained, departments are monitored and product is fresh and full. Friendly environment for employees and customers. There are a lot of people who can Manage. I am a Leader that can Manage."
good,All the employees were friendly and helped me to learn and my manager was great to work with.. Over all it was great experience working with 'Safe Way'.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, the benefits are extraordinary. Nationwide company means that you can work almost anywhere in the states, and once you're in, there are plenty of opportunities to earn promotions."
good,"I love working for Safeway but I do not like the management for the company.  The managers do not work, every time I see them they are sitting around talking.  As an employee who started as a courtesy clerk and moved up to checker, night crew, frozen, dairy and now produce I believe hard work pays off but when I see the people that are above me and in charge doing nothing it makes me ask myself why am I busting my butt for 9.85 an hour when they make way more than me just sit on theirs."
good,Great co-workers. management was good. Dealing with lot of personalities. very flexible. good benefits. lots of things you can learn  to get you up the ladder.
good,"A typical day at work includes greeting and assisting customers. As a food clerk, I operated the cash registers and audit cash tills at the closing shifts. As a cashier, the daily responsibilities was encoding produce codes, processing WIC checks, applying debit and credit cards for purchases, and assisting customers with additional savings programs. The skills learned at this employment was communications skills, problem solving, and cash handling.  The hardest part of the job is conflicts with customers. The best way I dealt with these conflicts is remaining calm, and try my best to accommodate the customer's needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people. This can be new employees who are new hires or transfers which create enjoyable relationships in the work environment. The rapport with customer also help create an happy environment."
good,Not a bad place to get some pocket money.  I always get plenty of ours weekly. You get paid weekly.  I started as a courtesy clerk and moved up to food clerk after 3 months.  A typical day would include culling bad produce and putting up fresh new items.  Management is ok and they do communicate with their employees and try their best to be flexible with scheduling and such.  I think the best part about the job is meeting new people and improving communication skills.  The more annoying aspect of the job is that it is indeed repetitive.
good,"Safeway was a good place for me to step out into the work field. It was my first job and taught me responsibility, time management, and customer service. Everyone at Safeway is friendly and social and work together. It was not easy to serve all the demands of customers and make everyone happy yet it was nice to know It was a collaborative job and I wasn't alone on anything."
good,"I enjoyed the work it was a friendly environment and the day passed by quickly when we were busy, but when it was slow it was a long shift, but the hours cutbacks is what subsequently forced me to quit and I didn't like that they over-hired."
good,A great opportunity when entering the job market. Multiple departments and job requirements definitely a growth opportunity.
good,"A typical day at work constructed of for me working as a cashier and making sure each and every customer was pleased with the service and did not leave the store disappointed. I learned that it is important to be patient and have good communication skill in order to satisfy customer needs. My co-workers were well supportive, some were a little engrossed into their own work without helping out a new employee but others were of great help. The hardest part of the job was when a customer stated that they did not have a good experience and having to deal with their distress was very sad. The most enjoyable part was seeing a smile on a customers face and helping people."
good,"Great management team that cares about the success of the store and the team members."
good,"Safeway was a lot of fun, I started as a HBA clerk, stocking and maintaining the heath and beauty departments in the store. We had a lot of fun building displays, and working as a team to achieve goals. Management was fair, and usually helpful with what we needed. Toughest part of my job was actually keeping our department isles neat(a lot of small merchandise). All team members were very helpful at Safeway, which made work that much better."
good,"Store and District Management can and will recognize the hard work you put in.  It is very possible to quickly move up either in a department or on the front end.  In many instances, District Management may move you backstage for Corporate training or to see another side of things.  Had a great time backstage, and learned a ton from executive management."
good,I enjoy most moments I had with this company. and did not enjoy leaving because I lost a good job. the management was very understanding.
good,"My position was centered around data entry. Everyday I would run a report of upcoming promotions that needed to be entered in our pricing system. Once a week, I would proof read hard copies of ads by division to ensure spelling, pricing, and product images were correct. I was the first point of contact when retail stores experienced pricing or ad issues with products. I learned to think with the customer experience in mind and gained extended knowledge in the grocery industry. I had a good experience with management as expectations and responsibilities were clearly communicated. Although, the opportunity to move up was very difficult. The hardest part of the job was handling store level issues and ad proofing. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you have a direct impact on the consumer experience as well as the retailer's."
good,"Challenging job working in the recruiting department. Recruiting for entry level clerks was tough. Pay was not competitive to lure good candidates. High turn over. Rinse, wash, repeat. "
good,"The pharmacy opens every single day at 9 AM and by 8:30,which is when I show up for work, there is already a line forming outside the pick up/drop off window. I typically start my morning by cleaning the pharmacy to ensure that no germs are spreading. I assist people at the pick up window and ask for the pharmacist consultation when the patient is receiving new medications or when they are a new patient in general. Around 10:00 I would start on our ""RTS"" which is when I locate all the medications on the shelves that has not been picked up in the last 7 days and put them back on the shelf. Around 10:30 is when our medication order delivery guy comes, so I would restock the shelves. I would check the computer to see if there are any E-script that needs to be taken care of and if so, I would type them. Despite it being such a challenging environment to work in at time due to the cranky patients, my co-workers made my job a lot easier. We would constantly help each other when we see that the other needs help. My manager was also flexible with my schedule. The hardest part of the job was feeling like there was nothing I could do for the sick patients at times. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was definitely seeing the joy on their face when we treat them with kindness and assure them that it is going to be ok."
good,"The beginning of my shift was great because everyone was there, but after 6pm it was just me and a few others. I learned different management technics. The benefits are great."
good,Working here was a good experience. They encouraged cross training and want to see you excel. The people that worked there were friendly and diverse.
good,"I loved working at safeway, It was a great work environment and loved the core store managers. They were very employee driven and treated everyone of their employees with respect and care. A typical work day would be great because of the great people and attitudes you were surrounded by.Though I must say being a deli clerk for almost a year I have experienced working in an unfair and lazy environment. The deli department manger was a good person she just lacked the knowledge and leadership of being a manager. There were many occasions where the department managers workload would be pushed off onto the associates. As associates we would have no problem with doing the work but it would take us away from our daily task that were expected to be done daily."
good,Interesting place to work and have a chance to improve customer service skills as well as learn new ones. Not much motivation or compensation for advancing in the company but overall a decent place to work. Management is willing to work with one's individual needs.
good,"A typical day at Safeway consists of interacting with customers and keeping the point of sale systems clean and providing customer service. "
good,"Learned how to solve conflicts between subordinates, write schedules and submit payroll. Held department meetings, as well as safety meetings."
good,"being a courtesy clerk is hard work. In that job you wear MANY different hats, you help the customers with finding merchandise and bagging the purchases, you clean different departments, bring in the shopping carts, make sure bathrooms are clean,"
good,You must be skilled at multi tasks and have excellent communication skills to manage a store. They give you huge amount of training and do promote from within. How ever you get paid for 40 hours and work on average 55 plus. I loved the challenges and the competitions. You have to be self driven because you will not get rewarded from your direct suppervisor.
good,was a very fun workplace but lacked proper leadership. i learned a lot there and was well compensated for it.
good,"Corporate job requiring working different shifts, different responsibilities, "
good,Fun place to go to work  there was always work to be done never a dull moment.
good,"Cooking, cleaning, customer care, and stocking. Also having product knowledge and taking the customer to the item."
good,"When I first started working for Safeway I hated it, I started at the bottom as a courtesy clerk. It involved grabbing carts in the rain or shine, bagging groceries for customers, cleaning up spills on an aisle and daily cleaning of the restrooms. As I moved up in my position at Safeway I began to love my job, I received more hours and my bosses were more flexible and I was doing work that more interested in me. Unfortunately Safeway does not help me move up in my career interests."
good,"....start the day with temp. checks...bb {best before} date checks...wrap and fill fresh meat counter...fill full service counter...various other duties as required by dept. manager..."
good,Safeway is a good company to work for. A lot of progress in my field. Learned great lessons in management. Great co-workers. Hardest part of the job is current situation with merger. Bit shaky and everyone on edge.
good,"A typical day was bagging groceries and pushing carts. Collecting carts was mainly what I did. Working at Safeway was a very basic job, so I didn't learn much. Safeway was a part time job during highschool just to put money in my pocket."
good,It was a fun place to work i wish it paid more i would have stayed longer
good,"I have worked for Safeway almost 8 years now.  We are currently going through an acquisition and jobs will be lost.  Being that I am in the Const/design dept, the fear is that we will be centralized.  Given the face that we will remain, I am still interested in another opportunity in which I have opportunity for growth and advancement.  Safeway has been a great place to work for and I will take what I 've learned and use it in future endeavors. The best part about this job is the people that i've grown to love.  Their cheerful attitudes and great personalities will be missed."
good,"I only worked at Safeway for a short period of time, but within that time I learned a lot about grocery store operations that I never knew before. Each day, whether I worked a night shift or a day shift, the tasks were always the same with a few random tasks here and there. I learned that each piece of unwrapped produce had a code that was to be typed in during the customers transaction to determine the correct price. Sometimes these items had to be weighed. In a few short weeks I had most of the codes memorized, after being an employee for almost a month, they trained me to be a bookkeeper at the customer service desk. The customers and my fellow co-workers were all very patient, helpful, and friendly. It was almost like while I was learning, everyone else was too. The hardest part of this job was making sure the customers were cashed out properly in a quick amount of time. Also, we were very understaffed which made everything a bit more stressful.Overall, I really enjoyed the experience I gained from working at a grocery store and would do it again."
good,"A typical day at work can be stressful because we usually don't have enough staff during busy hours, but the busyness passes the time quickly. I've learned how to handle money, make customers happy no matter the situation, how to process checks, cash and debit/credit transactions. Management is alright, I personally think there are somethings that could be improved. The hardest part of my job is pleasing unhappy customers because I feel that sometimes even if you go above and beyond their expectations they still are not happy. My most enjoyable part of my job is making customers happy and building relationships with them, I love it when I see people outside of work and they come up and say ""Oh my gosh! You're that girl from Safeway! I always wait in your line because you are the friendliest, most outgoing and funniest cashier at Safeway!""."
good,"I was employed as a courtesy clerk at safeway. I learned to be more open and talking to employees and coustomers became easy. Safeways co-workers are friendly and are willing to help with problems that anyone runs into. Sometimes when coutomers come in the store and are having problems or angry and they yell and we would have to resolve the problem, for me that seemed to be the hardest part. Id have to say the most enjoyable part of my time working at Safeway was the atmosphere everyone for the most part were very friendly."
good,"I enjoyed my job and with the opportunity I was given to  be promoted  to head bookkeeper I could have had great hours and good pay doing what I love to do, but because the process for advancing is up to the store manager , and that individual failed to follow up and do her job that caused me to miss the chance of having the position of head bookkeeper, it devastated me, the union rep was useless an failed to respond,with that I can only say it could have been a good job, hopefully they have made some changes and address some of the issues. On the good side they do provide excellent health benefits and other discounts and credit union with good pay."
good,"Analyze sales date for category management needs"
good,"Prepared meals and food cases, worked hard, greeted all customers, practiced multitasking, stayed busy preparing grab and go station, salad bar, worked well as a team durning peak business hours"
good,Due to recession there was not enough work in my dept. as we specialized in equipment replaced during construction or remodeling.
good,Safeway was a great job. It taught me to always work with your co workers an help each other out. The hardest part of the job was the hours being so slim. My favorite part of my job was being able to make my customer happy an always finding a way to tell them yes.
good,"Typical day at work for me was coming in contact with more than 200 people a day while trying to stock shelves and help run a store."
good,"Ensuring deliveries are received on time and quality of the products meeting legislative requirements."
good,The store itself is run very well. the companies system of advancing is very poor.
good,"I enjoyed working at Safeway.  Packing, cleaning and stocking were typical at work. I had no problems with communicating with my managers. I had a great relationship with them. "
good,"Safeway can be stressful from the lack of hours given to employees. If you can get past that because you're a hard worker, you'll love the work environment."
good,Its a good company to work at but the pay and advancement for a college graduate is not attractive.
good,Working in food manufacturing can be stressful and is not for everyone.  What makes this place great is the people.  Simple as that may sound it is very true about Safeway Merced.  You will learn a lot here and you will be pushed to your limits.  When you have a great team to work along side it is all worth while.
good,"It's a good company to work if you want to move up. Employees treat you fair, you feel at home."
good,Good company to work for.  Busy store with good customer service interaction. Safety Coordinator was a good addition to my regular  duties as front end checker.
good,everyday at work was a smooth day co-workers was great management was good just a fun friendly work place
good,Fun and friendly work environment. I get to interact with people from different walks of life.
good,Safeway is a great place to work but for me I don't get the hours I need. If I want to work full time I have to re-apply.
good,"I would come into work and sign on to may cash register. Then while i waited for a cashier call, I would help the other courtesy clerks with the sweep sheets or Bagging customers groceries. I would also man the Customer service desk if no one is there to help and since was already trained in produce department, on some days managing the incoming loads, doing changes to the produce product tables and helping the customers in produce is all i did. My co-workers were very helpful and getting things done with no complications or set backs was the enjoyable part of the day. Hardest part is on a busy day i had to cover other departments and cashier so a lot of running around mostly but kept the day going by..."
good,The typical day usually goes with are schedule that are managers make and it shows us are duty's for that hour of the day. It is usually different every day so you have to pay attention to it. Coworkers are pretty nice there they help out everyone if you need it or have a question that needs to be answer. The hardest part of the job is grabbing carts because if you grab to many the weight stacks up on you and make it hard to push. Our managers are pretty good about keeping on task and doing there job.
good,"Working for Vons has helped me to gain experience in managing and communication. I was able to work on my communication and problem solving skills with both customers and employees, such as helping and solving any problems that a customer had at the time. At times i would have to figure out how to solve problems that some of the more experienced managers didn't know how to solve. Although the job could be tough at times, I found that it challenged me into learning how to think on my toes, and learn how to lead a team into success."
good,"Took inbound calls and made outbound calls to pharmacies and Dr. offices in order to complete the prescription process for walk in patients. Monitored stock of medications, ordering medications on an as needed basis. Inputted prescriptions and billed patient insurance. Counted and filled prescriptions and assisted pharmacist with whatever duties they needed me to perform."
good,"Good productive, training, professional environment. Your salary was through a union, so you capped out at a certain amount. The benefits were great"
good,"I Worked at the customer service desk dealing with the public and solving problems. Dealt with the break schedules, and worked closely with cashiers assisting them in challenging situations. Had office work to do such as audits to make sure the tills were balanced, temp. logs, and bringing in tills at the end of the night. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people you work with and the positive atmosphere. The most challenging part of the job is making sure nothing skips a beat and making sure all the customers stay happy. I learned how to multitask better and improved my communication skills."
good,"Typically closing shift, customer service, good managers and co-workers"
good,"At this company I was responsible for ringing up customer purchases, processing various payment forms, and answering shopper inquiries about Vons products and services. "
good,Stocking and customer service are a major component of this job. The least enjoyable part is having to work as a checker too frequently. This is usually due to poor scheduling and cutting of hours. The produce department is one of the better departments in the store to work.
good,The company was a nice fun job to have. They worked with my schedule and helped me get more hours. They also gave me great experience and taught me a lot.
good,"A typical day was coming in and seeing what's going on and how is the department looking before i start, so like seeing what's low and what i need for the department to fill. I have learned a lot from working  there as response ability for my work i needed to get done. Knowing what's good or bad for working in the produce department and see how to pick out a good product and knowing all the different kinds of apples, oranges, salad, greens, soft fruit, and melons etc. Management was okay. Why , I say this is because we all get different managers over time so some are really good and some are okay. All my co-workers we were like a little family we had are ups and downs like a family but at the same time we knew how to work together. The hardest part working there was having a hard time understanding someone that speaks a other language. The most enjoyable part of the job was just having a fun day working with everyone in all the departments and helping out each other on things that we know one person cant do on them self and the most thing was keeping all of are costumers happy."
good,"In a typical day for a closing shift I am required to over see the work done by other cashiers as well as courtesy clerks. Keep them on task and maintain the shift schedual and break schedual. I also do cash pick ups from each till, audit certain tills throughout the eventing and perform closing dutys which include: bringing in all of the tills at the end of the night, changing our change machines as needed, shut down out Western Union system and print reports, counting the news papers for return, performing the store close in the computer system printing off reports and organizing them, counting tickets and calculating our sales for the day, arming cash office. "
good,"I am a cashier and deal with many customers, unhappy and happy. I try to help and fix any problem they might have. I have learned so much about customer service and how to fix problems. I learned quickly with the register and the PLU codes and WIC checks. Management is good but could probably help with how to deal with their employees better. I enjoy my co-workers and get along with them very well. The hardest part would have to be dealing with rude customers but I think I handle it well. The most enjoyable part is making a customer smile and knowing they had a good experience."
good,Most of my time here I was able to work in various department around the store and am able to do multiple tasks within the store.
good,So far on the team it has been fun. I have worked there for about a month now and I have learned a lot from other team members.
good,"Safeway is a great place to grow and learn. A typical work day is long and not the most rewarding, but valuable lessons are learned."
good,"-handling cash and helping out with customer service"
good,"Working in Safeway/Jordan is full of challenges & deadlines of projects."
good,In mexico i was working for a same company like gardaworld i was in does big trucks piking up money from the banks and different stores y was a very good job that was my favorite job i had. it was very dangerous but i like it it was fun. and every two weeks we had shooting practice. i was very good at shooting.
good,"i enjoy my job because i feel like i am helping people.  My co-workers are great, and my pharmacist are even better."
good,"Safeway has some of the best medical benefits around, the only problem with the benefits is management did not explain how well of benefits it has. The management did meet the needs of the employee time off request except when we were really busy."
good,i was incharge of doing the basic walk through of the department make sure there were no out of code product and make sure there wasnt a short of add items and or any other products. i was incharge of writing a list of production to meet our sales. Made a list for the night people just coming on shift to do before closing
good,"A typical work day at Safeway, I would bag until my turn to address sweep log, I learned that not everyone you meet at the work place will not be a nice person, Management at Safeway was a a handful of nice, and patient people, my co-workers were very helpful/ stepping stone to get me started in the right direction. The hardest part of the job was pushing shopping carts on a hot day, and the most enjoyable part of the job was, working until closing time, it always seemed like that's when the nice generous customers arrived."
good,"Positive work environment"
good,I learned a lot being a bakery clerk it was a new work experience and interested learning more job skills. My manager/supervisor where very favoritism which is very unprofessional. I got along with my co-workers.The hardest part of the job was doing my best and didn't get any good appreciation. The most enjoyable part of the job was showing up to work.
good,"Depending on the time I am scheduled to work, I am required to do the daily services and customer service. I also had to do the required paperwork such as distress, ordering, ect. I have learned how to execute drinks, satisfy customers, and the responsibilities of maintaining the business. Management is fair and excellent, I also enjoy those I work with.  The hardest part of the job is timing while having multiple customers to attend to. I mostly enjoy talking to each customer and getting to know each person I get in contact with."
good,"This was my first full-time job.  I've worked almost every job in the store, with the exception of becoming a manager.  I had good co-workers, managers were consistent and easy to work with, and there were lots of things to learn about this business.  I eventually began working nights and it was difficult to get off that shift when I got tired of that schedule."
good,"I was very excited to work at the Safeway Pharmacy in which I obtained a practicum after my schooling. My typical day was filling the medication order that came in via fax overnight, then dealing with the non-stop pharmacy customers beginning first thing in the morning. During this, I would put hundreds of medication inventory correctly on the shelfs in between customers. I learned a lot on the job such as inventory control via computer, deciphering dr's prescriptions, and making sure customer turn over was up to par. I also practiced compounding and pharmaceutical calculations,blister packing and quality control."
good,"Was a job for a few months. Stocking shelves at night is not that great. It's difficult to maintain a social life. "
good,I did learn many techniques while working at the Deli in Safeway.
good,You can get a set schedule if you stay with the company long enough. They have management training programs. 
good,"So long as you're willing to do your job everyone (employees, management and even customers) lets you know you're appreciated."
good,"I enjoyed working for Safeway, but could'nt get enough hours per week to provide"
good,"helped run the produce department, stocking shelves orders, customer service."
good,"A typical day at Safeway would start with a ""warm-up"" from a manager, which involved going through a typical check out process, using the right service attributes with a manager before being out into a register. In a register, I would interact with customers making sure to great with a smile, ask if they need help to their car, check for any items they missed in their cart and always thank by their last name and use a friendly parting comment. If I were working self check out, I would assist customers with any problems they come across at the self check out kiosks. Also, I would help at the service desk with returns, refunds, lottery, cigarette sales, money orders, and western unions. My coworkers were not just coworkers, they were more of a second family to me and I loved working with all of them. The hardest part of the job was always remembering that the customer is always right, but the most enjoyable part of the job was being exposed to the community and being able to meet a variety of new people."
good,I only worked here briefly but was a good expereince. This was my first job and gave me experience that I needed in life.
good,"This was a good job while I was in the school, on slow days after I had finished my duties I was able to focus on my school work and get those done."
good,- Very specific functions and manage a piece of the Business unit
good,"In the beginning of the month, it is busy everywhere. But since its busy, time flies and you have fun. You learn new things everyday and management is good. The co-workers are friendly and you get along with everyone. The group of co-workers I work with were like family. The hardest part of the job is when everyone is trying to get things done and another thing comes up. There are a lot of things that are hard, but you learn to get pass them. The most enjoyable parts of the job are when your entire shift is fun and busy."
good,"While working at Safeway I was always talking to different people and you never know what they will tell you sometimes good,sometimes bad. I learned the friendlier you are to people the better they will treat you. My manager always worked with my schedule so I could do all my high school activity's. My co-workers always knew how to make a boring job seem fun which made it alot more enjoyable. The hardest part was dealing with the homeless people that would pass out in the bottle room. The most enjoyable part was when they moved me to the floral department and I learned how to do arrangements and bouquets and work with flowers made everyday something different no flower was ever the same."
good,"typical day of work, show up to work and clock in. and then head to the deli to start my shift. i learned how to make a lot of different things and work at different stations behind the deli counter, also in kitchen. management was pretty good. co-workers were great to work with, taught me what i needed to know when i was training. hardest part of the job? dont think i had any problems there. i like to work with cook, and enjoy cooking... so the job was enjoyable."
good,"typical day at work, great co workers,management is fair, early starts."
good,"A typical day at work is where there is sales and customers are waiting to be served. I have learned how to serve multicultural customers, and how to reach a sales target. The management is professional. My co-workers are supportive. The hardest part of the job is when power went down, where I have to move the seafood products as quickly as I could into the big freezer. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I could reach the sales target."
good,"very fast pace work,,,always something to do,,,"
good,"Always felt like my voice was heard, and I was able to advance based off of performance. Pay raises were uncommon, even with two promotions there was only one, but it was made up for in a light atmosphere with Managers who interact with you."
good,i very much enjoyed working for safeway i learnt alot. they were very helpful when i became a mum working with me to make sure i had the hours in needed to still be an active parent.
good,Every day working with customers and employees for the better of the community
good,As long as you do your job its a great place to work. There is lots of opportunity for advancement and training.
good,Met a lot of friends from this job.
good,"Helping Individuals In Need Of Customer Service, Learning Different Job Duties With Helping A Grocery Store Company"
good,it was a fast pace work environment and that is my preference.
good,was a great place to work I enjoy the interaction with the customers and employees
good,"I have been employed with Safeway for over ten years and have absorbed a lot of useful skills along the way. These skills have helped shape me as a leader, listener, mentor, and customer service oriented worker. Knowing how to please a friendly customer is easy, knowing how to please a crabby one provides an equal opportunity to expand your own skills as well as your business."
good,"Having stayed at Vons for over a year, I'd say it was a pretty good job. I loved being in constant contact with customers and doing my best to always go the extra mile to put a smile on their faces. I'd say its safe to say, if the pay was higher and the raises came quicker, I'd still be with the company."
good,Voice activated system . Stand up forklift operations.
good,I worked for both store level and head office. Head office was very fast paced and detailed. When I was at store level it seemed that head office really did not care. Turns out head office was just following what the US offices were telling them.
good,good place to work friendly staff who can take time and help a customer if they need something. always answers a phone call to take an order for different departments healthy multi-cultural environment.
good,I enjoyed working for Safeway. It was a fun and chalenging job and worth making a career at.The most ejoyable part of the job was meet new and interesting people and even a few celebrities.
good,Safeway.com delivery drivers position it's fun physical gives me satisfying  feeling  when you're helping out the community with grocery deliveries For myself I was mostly satisfied with being able to assist the elderly and or challenged by delivering  to the front door only downfall is Safeway does not pay enough to make a living out here in Silicon Valley
good,"Overall great company , Encouraging atmosphere,  excellent team building,  great benefits,  union is a plus. Great training programs for employees.  Love it"
good,"Pays well, but little work life balance. Benefits and retirement are also competitive. Holidays are crazy busy, and leaves little time to be with family."
good,"It was just like any other job show up do your work"
good,"Production keeps me very busy. Customers are basically local and like family, as well as my fellow coworkers are like family. Close knit work place and community. I wouldn't say all Safeways are equal to mine, I believe it's our managers that make this store what it is. Always about making the customers happy and wanting to shop there."
good,love the environment and how courteous staff is with me. There's always something to do and someone to greet and assist at a grocery store. My supervisor that hired me was very nice and the interview built my self confidence
good,This job has helped me develop a lot as a person and a manager. I get to work with different individuals all across the board and learn to work with different types of individuals.
good,"Started as a deli clerk and then promoted to assistant manager and then promoted to deli manager.. Very rewarding but as I was moved up in the company, I was moved around alot."
good,the job was ok at times just nothing enough at times when you need it but you learn alot there if you go to the outside dept. like meat dept.or deli i learned alot when i was in the meat dept. that i still use in my everyday life still
good,There is constantly something to do or be working. Little to no downtime which is good for someone who enjoys being on their feet and busy. Management is overall well put together and runs well.
good,"Good job if you are in school, they really try and work with your schedule and try and accommodate you. Easy to move up if that's what you want/ are looking for."
good,The management staff were for the most part fair and friendly. Coworkers were great! Lower level management were awesome! This company is very good at cross training there employees to give them a more diverse skill set. There is also great opportunity for advancement.
good,"Really busy, especially for the holidays.  At the same time, I had a lot of fun here.  I was able to really expand my skill set and collaborate with customers to bring their dream desserts to life."
good,"After clocking in, I'd check the promo shelves and prepared to restock and cook for dinner rush. Typically roasting chickens, prep sandwich bar, drop fryers and refill displays. We had regulars that dropped in and knew what to expect. I needed to be prepared for travelers and students depending on the season. Coworkers were worth it too. No regrets working in the deli; never thought I'd enjoy it, but with the right mind set, it was a good stepping stone and made friends while there who still keep in touch. It was worth every minute."
good,"For the last 5 years I was able to move up in the company fast; My location is very fast paced, busy, and the only grocery store within a small radius. My manager is fantastic! He's kind, caring, giving, and understanding. On the flip side he has so many tasks to do himself it is sometimes hard to get his undivided attention. My location also has a hard time hiring people due to the shortage of hours and wages for new employee's. My days are usually filled with multiple duties; including stocking product, ordering, customer service center, cashiering, display making and proper signage, as well supervising fellow employees. I love my job for the everyday challenges that corporate springs on us and being in a small community you feel the love and support we have not only from the town but also from the city, police, and neighboring businesses."
good,"Safeway is a good place for the individual seeking work early on in their professional life. My experience with the work load and management have been positive, as have been my experiences with fellow employees and the overall culture of the company. The only major downside is that you will be given a rather chaotic schedule if you're just starting out, and shouldn't expect to work more than 20 hours a week. Anticipate to work disparate shifts, such as the early morning day, and closing for the next day you're scheduled."
good,"Very by the book and organized which I appreciate. Sometimes there are managers who have no business being in charge of other people, but the upper management doesn't really care. Pay isnt the same as it used to be."
good,Great store management team that are positive and engaged. I had excellent training on health and safety. I am always allowd to do what I do best. Positive Store Manager who promotes confidence with his employees.
good,It’s a great place to work. You learn different skills everyday. Getting to know customers and seeing regulars is one of the best parts of the jobs. Listening to how their day went and what their plans are for the evening just makes my day. I find it hard sometimes to understand some customers through the loud background noise but everything else about the job is great!
good,"One of my best work experiences, as far as working goes. The managers work with you to help you grow with the company instead of trying to force you to bend like publix does."
good,"Great place to get a foot in the door. Fast paced, customer service oriented, but the higher you get the more stress. Can advance quickly if you show drive"
good,Great for a student or someone looking for a part-time job. The pay is not the best but there's room to move up quickly and they will usually work around your class schedule.
good,"If I were to apply for this company, I would go someplace. It is not a good company like it was in the past. It has been deteriorating day after day. The culture has really falling and there is no support from the managers anymore."
good,"Performed store product counts and pricing jobs at competitor stores. The position no longer exists, the whole department was laid off/eliminated. The health benefits were awesome for a part-time job."
good,"Youd clock in and just jump right in, whether thatd be a bagger, every hour having to bag, do carts, or clean the store, as a cashier youd be at the checkstand ringing up custumers and asking how their day went and just making sure their shopping experience is good, or as a bakery clerk just jumping in and start pakcaging, labeling, and taking out the products as well as helping sutomers with any questions they may have."
good,"It's a company with a solid foundation. It has it's faults and strong points, like every company. Personally, I believe a job experience is largely based in each individual's attitude. My review? The company can lead you to success as long as you show up."
good,Working at Safeway is challenging. The Safeway I worked at was a union store so there were a lot of guildlines to follow. As the Front End Manager I tried to make it fun. We would have contests when it came to fund raising. It is important with a front end job people understand they are more than just a cashier or courtesy clerk. I always wanted the cashiers to feel appreciated as their job could get stressful
good,For people that like a fast pace work environment this is your place.  Sometimes you will have to rely on your time management skills to get certain tasks done.
good,A great place to work at learned how to work with many different people how to rotate dates making sure all customers got fresh products. Management worked well and understands when you need to take time off.
good,In order to be successful you must know how to work as a team to achieve all task. You must also have patience for customers. And always remember to be your best when you not your best.
good,Management generally allows you to be very flexible with your hours ranging from working once a month to working upwards of 20 hours a week. Sort of clique-y but very easy to ignore.
good,"Starting was fun and easy. It was easy to pick up and learn. Mu team members taught quickly and efficiently. Each work day is different. Sometimes its fast paced, other times its dead quiet."
good,"You can make great money if you are not afraid to work hard, Depending on warehouse and shift you will work a lot of overtime.  Union environment is not the easiest to deal with at times.  Great people with long term employment."
good,"Overall, my time at Safeway was very good. I worked the hours I wanted, recieved descent compensation, and generally enjoyed my workday. The only letdown was the protection some union employees recieved from the company despite numerous employee complaints."
good,I was a cashier and this job was fast paced.  Depending on the time of the day customers would be constantly be coming in.  We had to know sku numbers for produce.  If we did not recognize this information our productivity was slow.
good,always like the grocery business I like dealing with customers I like building projects building display stocking produce cashier stocking getting rid of product cross merchandising
good,"I would clock in and spend the day gathering shopping carts, emptying and replacing bins in the recycle machines, stocking shelves, cleaning the store, and helping customers with bagging and carrying out their groceries, finding items in the store, and reaching items on high shelves."
good,"It is a good job but management and especially corporate management is stressed and not very professional. If you stay with the company long enough you can make a good living wage and good benefits. However, with the latest union contract it is much longer of a process to get raises and very hard to get full-time status."
good,This is a place that tried to work with you and if you showed promise tried to advance you. they were friendly and seemed fair. It was also in the teamsters union.
good,The Food Retail Business is a very competitive fast past environment. I have been in retail since I was 16 years old learning all the competencies it takes to manage a multi million dollar food retail store. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to promote one of my employees to a new position.
good,At safeway warehouse its very fast paced job only the strong can survive. You gotta have that hunger or ambition to want to get that money in order to do it.
good,It was a good first job. The manager didn't like that I couldn't work much during the school year. The other managers had me do things that weren't in my job description but you get used to it.
good,The job was my first and it left a good impression on me for what to expect in a grocery store;  it led me to finding another grocery store with better pay but over time my second job in a grocery store became something i dreaded.
good,It is a consistently busy environment. From 7am-8pm there was a constant flow of customers then plenty of time before close to complete the cleaning and facing procedures before heading out for the night.
good,loved working there. Loved co workers. I loved cashiering and meeting all the people made new friends. I got a 10 on all my secret shoppers. I really am a team player. Have excellent customers service skills.
good,"Management here consist of 2 types of groups. First is the main management that consist of the main adult managers who keep it running well and responsible.  Second group are teenagers who abuse the title, goof around and is difficult to work with. Ususally at night shifts. Lets many get away with lots of wrong doing."
good,"Fellow employees were friendly, helpful"
good,"I've worked both in the deli and the produce's fresh cuts department. I've avoided the cashiers and courtesy clerks jobs because I've heard terrible stories about them from coworkers. In the deli, it was fast paced and you felt like you never finished anything you set out to do, lots of waiting on customers. And you always smell like fried chicken. In Fresh Cuts, I became really close with the people I worked with every day. We only had two or three people in the department working and there is little to no customer service for that department. There is a lot of gossip and drama, as would come with any job, you just have to keep your nose out of it and it's actually a fun job."
good,"Great place to work, with union benefits. My only issue with it was that the hours were extremely inconsistent and caused a strain with my personal life."
good,"Definitely a job for someone looking to work a lot of hours for minimal physical labor. Be dedicated to customer service and your duties and it is an easy, smooth learning process and job in total."
good,I would clock in and start off by covering for someone when they go on break . I would check people out and help load their carts and ask if they need further assistance
good,"Enjoyed work ..load & personnel in Bellevue at all the various tasks,Jobs & teachings I received.There were many knowledgeable , patient ,and kind People willing to share their experience."
good,I enjoy the job.  Learned many skills in all areas of the grocery store.  Friendly people.  Start early in morning preparing the cash and daily pricing.  Had different tasks every day so it wasn't boring with repetition.
good,The job by itself was alright but the management wasn't that great due to always having issues and not a solid manager. Or regular store management would have conflicts with employees months after they've been hired.
good,I met the love of my life working at Safeway. It is a friendly and loving environment. Safeway is a family and a community of friendly workers who care about their customer's needs.
good,"As my first real job, I learned a lot! The company takes good care of their employees. I did have some trouble with a power hungry disrespectful manager but the company did a good job at doing what they could to correct it. Overall I would say it was great experience and not a bad place for a career."
good,A typical day at work is very fast paced and busy. I have learned to have a good work ethic from this job. management was great. The workplace is very friendly and the employees get along very well. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work environment as well as it being busy and quick paced.
good,"Depending what shift you work you can be working by yourself or with others in a team environment. I like writing on the birthday cakes . The hardest part is remembering the product changes(size, discontinued, etc)"
good,so some of the workers made it kinda hard to work but everyone was very helpful with training me and I worked by myself for the most part. my training was a little rough but I got the hang of it pretty well. I liked my boss a lot actually she was very understanding and I regret leaving
good,A typical day at work varies between each department. I have learned to speak up when needed. The management is pretty good. The hardest part of the job is getting bad customers.
good,"A typical day at work timing wise was not the mkst consistant. Having seniority over some of my co-workers, I got to chose when I get to work and how much I get to work throughout the week. On weekends I would always open because everyone worked 8 hours on the weekends and getting out at 1, I still got the rest of my day."
good,Stressful environment. Especially during holiday season. Good benefits. Good people. Not a lot of room for growth. Raises only came in annually. Union company
good,Busy environment good customer interaction good selection of shifts many different departments to choose from a good work environment with nice people
good,"I like working at Safeway. But the location I’m at in Virginia, I’m only getting between 4-7 hours everyday and 30 or less hours during the week. Management is okay. Customers are some what okay. Very quick paced environment."
good,For the most part I had a great crew.  Communication with my team was productive.  I was consistently in the top three producers and so set the example.  They were competitive and that made for a better team.  Store management backed us up and were helpful when needed.  I miss working there.
good,"I got only 2 shifts a week now, 4 hours each. Which is fine cause I need time to work on assignments but I got too much time for my assignments; too much free time."
good,"the employees and managers were all nice to work with there, and they were very kind and friendly. I knew that this job was going to be temporary, but I still liked working there."
good,I love working there but ever since Albertsons bought us out things have gone down hill. Our schedule that changes weekly i now put through auto scheduling instead of in store where we know how many people are going to need on certain days. I can live with the low pay and everything it suggests the scheduling that messes with me since I can't plan anything ahead of time nor do we ever seem to have enough workers. Also to clarify as a courtesy clerk we are only allowed to be part time and only guaranteeing 16 hours a week.
good,"The day would begin with a routine inspection of the work area to be sure it is ready for shoppers. Next would be the collection of carts well before time and make sure they were ready for the customer. "
good,"the days went by fast when it was busy, slow when it wasn't. There was a lot of codes to memorize for fruits and veggies but if you couldn't remember something it wasn't a big deal cause there was this menu you could look it up on. The people I worked with were all chill and super helpful."
good,"Typical day was doing the best to satisfy customer's needs."
good,"Started out as a bagger with the company. After 1.5 years, moved up to liquor department. After 6 months, moved up to become a manger in the department of another store. Six months after that, i ended up quitting due to personal reasons. Over the course of time of my employment with the company, i've noticed a difference in work ethic between workers in the store and corporate workers. In my opinion, the corporate workers tend to come off as intimidating as when everytime they visit a store, the store employees mood suddenly will change, and the overall vibe becomes less mellow and relaxed and more intense. Hopefully that can change."
good,"Working at Safeway is not a bad route to take as far as employment. The pay and hours are good and the coworkers are cool for the most part. It can get stressful at times especially during holidays or other special occasions but once you receive that paycheck you say to yourself ""eh, it was worth it."" The management was functional although it was quite inconsistent. The hardest part of the job was being able to handle new tasks being thrown at you while also juggling with the tasks you already have, as well as dealing with multiple customers at one time. In addition, you will not always get your lunch time and breaks on time as scheduled. The most enjoyable part I experience with the job was being able to bond and get to know your fellow employees when the day is not as busy. I loved laughing and talking with my coworkers when we are on lunch break or while being on the clock if the store is not that busy as It makes your shift go by a lot faster. On the flip side you will get coworkers who are quick to draw the seniority card to get their way. So, if you are a rookie or new comer at Safeway expect some of the older employees to try and get over you."
good,Work hard as you can but not really recognized by anyone no matter what. Lots of slackers who dont really do anything but they get into a different position faster than the ones busting there butts.
good,"Front end cashier. I enjoyed the fast pace and the enter action with the customers. I learned how to operate the cash register, how to be a team player. The importance of good work ethics. How to set up and load floor displays. Staying up for the  first few nights on the night shift was difficult. I liked the people both the customers and my co-workers"
good,"You can absolutely do well and move up the ranks in Safeway but you need to be focused and keep a positive attitude. Take initiative and if you have a manager that is less than standard, you will need to rise above it, not let it bring you down. This can be hard to accomplish, you must be disciplined. As long as you always operate with honesty and integrity, you will do fine."
good,Great place for a first time job! Great management and employees. Many departments to choose from. Very open to improvement regarding employees. Plenty of benefits.
good,The job culture in safeway Is a little cutthroat but the meat department was more so. The money is good but be careful of ur coworkers because they will mess up and tell everyone it was you who did it.
good,"The management understood my skills and placed me in a position that I would flourish in. The only problem I had was with fellow employees who didn't like my strong work ethic and cheery attitude, and made it difficult work environment."
good,"This store is Unique."
good,"Provides a safe working atmosphere with tons of great people. Dealing with customers can be annoying, but that's part of the job. Management is good for the most part."
good,Job was mostly janitorial and cleaning up customers that misplaced items. Cleaned up parking lot mornings/nights. Cart and product returns. baggage help with requests.
good,"Every workday I would clean and the prep kiosk for the next day needs.I'd help customers with their orders and make the drinks. "
good,"Safeway was a fun place to work, but has recently closed most of their stores in the lower mainland forcing many to look for other jobs, I really enjoyed my coworkers so it's bittersweet to leave"
good,It was relaxed and usually quiet. I mostly worked graveyards or  evening shifts. My job title was  stocker/ cashier. I would help train new co-workers as well.
good,"Sometimes it is hard to finish the task if it is only rely on one person specially during the rush hour. Because the starbucks i worked is under Safeway's management, they do not provide the same benefit as corporate starbucks."
good,I really liked working at safeway in multiple states and in multiple stores.  The co- workers are friendly and good to work with.  Managers try their best to do right by you.
good,"I worked a nights, so usually it was very calm chill. Had work with a good team of people. Stocking and unloading freight wasn’t hard at all. Very good team building job"
good,Had an amazing boss which ended up teaching me a lot. Learned how to heard and deep Frye chicken. How to put party trays together. How to do inventory for the deli
good,"My job was to service any customers that required help in bagging groceries, assistance carrying groceries to their car, keep check stands, floors, and bathrooms clean, as well as keep up any spills. I learned a lot of experience in customer service to keeping customers happy and how to deal with upset customers to attend to their needs so that they are satisfied. The hardest part was making sure fellow courtesy clerks communicated with each other to getting tasks done because we are constantly racing around the stores so we need to keep track where everyone is."
good,"A typical day at work involved a lot of walking and regular interpersonal communication, with opening and closing hours involving their own tasks and responsibilities."
good,Safeway was always fun to work at with the great helpful staff who would never hesitate to assisate you with somthing you didn't know. Safeway helped me improve my social and customer service skills
good,"It's good work environment and as long as you do your work effecientialy and productively, management pretty much leaves you alone to do your job.  Would recommend it"
good,"Working for Safeway, it was a good job but the pay was bad, the cashiers were often rude to other coworkers and the store was insanely stressful during holidays. Management is decent but it has absolutely no interest in building professional relationships with its employees."
good,"Safeway can be very fast paced, the work I did was simple to do."
good,Nearly everyday was the same as most people would come throughout the same times throughout the week. You did the same tasks everyday so it is not something that you will find super interesting but it is not also super boring as it is a grocery store and the people coming through change everyday.
good,"Love the management and the customers! The pay is very low for the cost of living in this area so it's a struggle even with overtime. Albertsons corporate is always making changes and that seems to annoy some people in Management more than others. I am fine with the changes, but not everyone is."
good,"I worked as a courtesy clerk and a bakery clerk, averaging 30+ hours a week. Management was nice, the job was fairly easy although very quick paced and a lot to do each night as a closer that made it a bit stressful. No benefits unless you're a manager or are full time for a full year."
good,Safeway is fast paced. Management changes frequently and that can have pro and cons. There is also a high turn over rate of employees.Good opportunities for growth.
good,"Lovely place to work, friendly staff. Good environment. Very caring management, flexible hours. Learned many skills throughout time in the department."
good,"They really do encourage growth within the company and will push you towards a senior position if they see something in you. The ONLY complaint I have was that I never received my raise after my probation period and the pay was to low to live off of, at the time."
good,"A typical day at work with Safeways was usually very fulfilling and busy. Being trained in most areas of the store I found myself in different departments regularly,I really enjoyed the team I was apart of as well. I learnt how to do inventory, lead a team, professionally, train new employees. The work place culture was quick paced and friendly. The hardest part of my job-- well I felt it was very bearable work! And lastly, the most enjoyable part of my job was the growth in responsibility, the joys of training new employees and running my own cut fruit team."
good,"A typical day for me at the fuel station was usually full of angst due to the fact that it didn't matter what I had done the previous day, I would still have to pick up the slack of my co-workers daily because they would leave it all up to me due to the fact they knew I was a hard worker and would never leave a job unfinished, even if it meant working overtime. Which by the way because I had to constantly pick up the slack for the rest of the team, I would also get reprimanded for working overtime when need be. However, being from a military background I welcomed the challenge, remained flexible, and truly appreciate Safeway for giving me the opportunity and would gladly go back in the future if the opportunity presented itself."
good,"High work flow with little down time makes for a fast day."
good,"There is never a dull moment when I came into work. There will always be work to be done in the deli department. I worked 8 hours straight with no breaks. "
good,"I really enjoyed working for Safeway. I always stayed busy wether it was working in the check stand or arranging produce. Customer service was extremely important which was easy for me since I really enjoy talking to people and helping them out. Working in the Produce department was challenging and fun as well. I lifted heavy boxes and stacked them in the coolers when a truck load came in. I arranged the fruit and vegetables in a visually appealing manner. I cleaned shelves, swept and mopped floors. I got to work in the check stand everyday as well which was enjoyable and fast paced. Management was always pleasant to work with. Working for Safeway was very team oriented."
good,"i worked for safeway for 22 years,i met alot of people,learn alot from people i worked with.  workers are friendly and outgoing,i seen alot of managers come and go.  only two mangager i would go back and work for."
good,"It was a productive work environment with lots of additional outings for employees. There were lunches, bowling, and Christmas parties. The staff really felt like a community!"
good,I liked working at Safeway. I loved seeing the customers and working with such great people. Seeing usual customers and having them recognize me was always such a great feeling.
good,Worked as a selector by selecting orders giving to me threw a year piece and having to make at 80 percent of the product picking up for being able to ship to the store all around the states
good,"Safeway trained me in many different positions in the store. (Bakery, Deli, Starbucks, Deli, Floral, front end, GM stocking, and Inventory receiving.)  Mainly leading up to be a head bookkeeper. I worked close with management and very close with customers. I always made sure there shopping experience was above and beyond what they needed. I loved interacting with customers who then became regulars because they loved the appreciation and friendliness they deserved for shopping with Safeway. Even if a customer was rude and mad at some reason, I always made sure they left with a smile on there face willing to return again for another pleasant shopping experience."
good,This is a company that's very good on payroll and how to maximize profits through savings in payroll and proper scheduling. It was a great experience to learn the grocery business of retail.
good,good benefits and room for advancement. It is a union job so workers are protected. Salary is low compared to other jobs. ............................
good,"my day at safeway is meet new people, and I learn how to stock food ,the management is good , the hard part of the is cleaning the store ,the enjoyable part of the job is making money"
good,"-A typical day at work usually meant running carts, bagging at the registers, go-backs and cleaning."
good,"The team I belonged to had a very encouraging management team. They provided us with a lot of learning and development opportunities. I became part of special projects that broke the monotony of a ""desk job"" and made going to work something that I looked forward to."
good,"its a good place to work at . its got good benifits and paid vacations ,the management is ok ,,,they work with you if you need days off.its alot of fun ..the workers are friendly for the most partl"
good,"This was my job while in high school. I started out bagging groceries, helping customers with them and cleaning. I them moved to a cashier position. Sometimes I helped out in the deli or bakery."
good,Fast paced and everyday different challenges. My last position with Safeway was the most challenging position I've experienced in thirty plus year's. Sedona being a very fluent and tourist area it was nearly impossible to fully staff.
good,Fast-paced environment with friendly people.  There is a lot of competition among departments.  Competitive nature can come off as hostile at times.  Friendly management staff.
good,"Safeway overall is a pretty decent company. working in Arizona can be difficult due to its a right to work state. the pay in my opinion for the job duties, respect and loyal-ness i've had for the company for 11 years is not what i think it should be. meat department is one of the more challenging departments to work in because every aspect  desires the upmost dedication and detailed-ness. not everyday is the same but for the most part if you have a daily plan and stick to it, you can work stress free. workplace culture is fairly decent, most employees get along like family and most dont. thats just how life is but you must remain kosher to the people you deal with on a daily basis and remember you are all there to reach a common goal."
good,"A normal day at Safeway depends on the department you work in. I was lucky to be able to work in several departments. Everyday is a learning experience because you never know where you will be in the store during your shift. Working there is a fast paced environment with very little slack time which is a good thing. Store managers are hands on, meaning they are not in their office all day but rather out on the floor working along side you, keeping employees busy."
good,As I move on to another job I take my skills from what I learned in my past jobs and put them to use in my new job as well as communication with the my coworks. I It is very competitive as far as working in different lines all at once. Fun as well because your time gose by and I challenge myself with time so i can be faster nd better...
good,Great first job for some but definitely wouldn't keep for long term. Very understaffed and i was always asked to stay late. I usually always had homework and i would have to stay later than i was scheduled so everything could get done because it wasn't a job that was very popular or one that people wanted to keep.
good,Safeway was a good place to work. I was a barista in the licensed Starbucks store there and the work environment was healthy. It was equal work shared by two to three people. It was your average grocery store job.
good,"Chances for advancement, fun work atmosphere. Managers were usually good, they came and went fairly quickly. Full benefits. Paid time off. Paid sick leave."
good,This company served as a starter job for me through high school and college and now I am looking for a new opportunity. A typical day at work is to start off the day see what needs to be completed by a chart on the clip board. What I learned from Safeway was to be stronger than I ever thought I had to be learning new experiences not only alone with the job duties but also with handling customers needs and wants. Management was overall well and fair. Workplace culture not that great a lot of hostility in the workplace people not agreeing with how a job should be done. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the co-workers customers were better. The most enjoyable part of the job helping out customer's and providing them with excellent customer service.
good,There are no Safeway’s in Tx and I. Truly miss working there. I worked there for over 12years and I do miss it. One of the best bakery managers I’ve ever had
good,I worked here for almost two years the people were fun to work with for the most part but it was also pretty stressful sometimes. But overall if you like being busy all the time id recommend Safeway.
good,I enjoyed my time with Safeway. I started with the company as an in store cleaner after being made redundant from a previous position elsewhere but it did not take them long to realise my future potential and having taken into consideration my previous experience I was promoted to assistant front end controller and then controller within twelve months. My responsibilities included running of the checkouts with sixty staff to supervise and the scheduling of those staff. I was also responsible for running of customer services. Other main responsibility was liasing with the cash office in the checking of all till balances.
good,"Schedule is flexible around college hours, great for students looking for a job on the side. Pay is ok for a non specialized position, but the salary cap is low."
good,"I'm an ""assistant manager"" and I'm supposed to get 40 hours a week. My manager never provides me with more than 30 hours even though I work the hardest in my department. If you are okay with less than full time this job is great. Amazing medical and benefits. I've been with the company for 5 years and I'm sad to go but I have to provide for my family."
good,"As a Personal Shopper for Online Ordering, the hours were flexible for what I needed. It is an early morning shift that is fast paced but the time goes by quickly."
good,"fast paced, great learning experience. was able to build customer relations and a positive working environment even during stressful holiday shopping needs."
good,"A typical work day goes by either fast, or very slow... My coworkers were very helpful with me when I first started working. The Deli manager was kinda rude at times. But I put the attitude in the back and moved on from it while doing what she told me to do... The workplace was very fun, fast, and a lot of learning was being done. I had to learn how to maintain the hotcase, clean the fryers, and do a whole 5 hour shift by myself... The hardest part about the job would have to be when youre there by yourself and have to keep up on the costumers, food, and everything else all at once it feels like. The most enjoyable part is watching the costumers walk away with a smile on their face because they got what they wanted and was being treated well. I enjoyed working with my coworkers as well,  they made great friends."
good,"In the bakery department as a helper you learn various tasks. I learned how to proof, fry and decorate donuts. I also got to help assist the bakers with bread, cookies, muffins and setting up various other goods to be baked. Keeping areas clean and organized was another task, as well as washing dishes and taking out trash. "
good,"I did enjoy my time with Safeway, but after multiple buyouts and transitions in pharmacy protocol it got a little crazy. The tech hours to Rx amount seemed unreasonable to me especially since customer satisfaction was of utmost importance to corporate. If it were not for my amazing Pharmacist in Charge, I probably would have left sooner"
good,Make up fresh seafood case.Fill and rotate stock.Fill out orders for fresh and frozen products.Inventory done monthly.Writing up work schedules for employees.Customer service.
good,love the people I work with just poor management. Would recommend if you are in school. they are pretty flexible on hours. My store was really busy all the time so its pretty fast paced.
good,Typical workday of a Night Clerk Grocer consisted of a very fixed schedule that mainly relied on staying on a schedule. Working to restock shelves at night and cleaning up afterward. Making the store presentable was a must and management would get upset when there was no time to do so. The day to day schedule always remained the same.
good,I started as a courtesy clerk and quickly worked my way up to cashier and then customer service. I really enjoyed working at Safeway and the people I worked with. unfortunately I ended up moving.
good,"I enjoyed working for Safeway but I was sent to different Safeways all over the Pacific Northwest. In a 2 week period, working 4 days each week, I averaged 179 miles per day! I suffered from exhaustion and management didn't care."
good,"All of the people at Safeway were very nice and easy to work with, but low pay scale. Customer relationship was very good. I had a lot of repeat business."
good,"everyone in the working environment is friendly and everyone gets along, the managers are nice and get along with all the workers. it was a fun job where you could have fun but still be on task and get the job done."
good,Worked on sales floor and interacted with customers and other employees through the work day. Worked at a set pace and rarely had no work to do as it was usually very busy.
good,"This is my first time applying for Safeway, therefore knowing myself, i  will try my best to get myself settled for what comes through in such time given to me. But i know that if worked here at safeway it will give me much more experience for the next jobs i apply for. Right now this is the best option for me to do because at my age i know things will be different for me. I truly will love this job and will love it more if i am most comfortable with it."
good,Hours got cut a lot had to deal with a lot of corporate bs. I did love working with who I was working with all the time. Would go back if hours where better.
good,It was a good place to work. The location of the store I was at wasn't the best so I had many strange encounters with the customers but the store and management was fairly well
good,"I worked on the night crew so my position had a more stable work schedule than other departments.  It is very busy and stressful during holidays.  The pay rate varies depending on which department you work in, however there are regular pay raises, paid vacation and health benefits.  There is also an opportunity for overtime work. There is the ability to transfer to another department that suits you better or work up to management positions.  There is a lot of standing on concrete floors, walking, bending and heavy lifting, so the jobs can be very physically demanding. You are dealing with customers all day, so if you are a people person it is a good job.  Sometimes the managers can expect more work from the employees than is realisticly possible to do, which can be frustrating.  Overall I enjoyed my time working for Safeway and would recomend it to job seekers."
good,"A typical day in File Maintenance depends on whether you are putting up the sale tags overnight on Tuesday', working during the day during the week or weekend. Tuesday nights a person is just hanging tags, the rest of the time a person is hanging tags, making display signs and hanging those signs.  The weekend is the same as the weekdays with fewer tags and signs. File Maintenance is great as a 2nd job. While in this position I learned how to print tags and apply price changes. The hardest part was working overnight once a week while the most enjoyable part was helping the customers. Management is reasonable and easy to work with.  The culture is easygoing."
good,"Safeway is decent place to work, But once you get into management the expectations of the job sometimes are unrealistic.  Its supposed to be a family workplace but its anything but.  If something happens with daycare or family issues its very hard to get off work, manly only in management."
good,I did night stock at safeway so the store was closed at nite we just had to make sure we had our shelves and aisles stocked before the store opend for buisness..
good,Working at Safeway was my first job and there was not much to learn. I would bag food and other things then proceed to push carts. It was good money for being in high school.
good,Wanted more hours and room to advance but they hired more people and cut my hours. If a company makes you feel worthy and valued your eager to get to work but when they cut your hours to 8-10 a week you don't really want to run there..
good,Good entry level job with plenty of people skills to develop and keeping busy with helping out customers and listening to their concerns so that you can better help them out.
good,"Working at Safeway is a good experience for young people, in order to show them the work world much quicker. You aren't able to move up quickly but are able to gain knowledge for advancement in other areas"
good,"I enjoy this job and my coworkers, but I wish we were able to receive full time easier. It is hard to provide for a family on an inconsistent 20-30 hours a week."
good,"Safeway was my first job and I went in fully committed and motivated. Unfortunately, following their merger with Albertsons to gain an advantage in the competitive market, decision making in the upper end has been very inconsistent."
good,The health benefits are outstanding in my opinion.  The management in certain departments can be lacking and sometimes the morale also leaves a lot to be desired.
good,"Fairly busy store, always something to do. Management can relate to all employees. Cashing is an easy position, and people are easy to get along with."
good,But Safeway did not pay very well for sevice clerks and to advanced to become a cashier was not easy thing to do.asa sevice clerk I could get 40 hours but a cashier I could only get 20hours and I would of lost all my benifits .so I stayed a sevice clerk .after a long while l left the job so could get a job as a cashier.
good,"My store is always busy and busy is good. The hardest part about my job is when lines get backed up and page repeatedly for someone to come help and no one comes, other than that I love my job and love ringing up our regulars. It' a fun face paced work environment that makes time go by fast and that's what I like."
good,"The management was  great, well informed and supported  its staff in any situation .  Customer satisfaction was Ultimate goal."
good,"There is no typical day at Safeway, for me at least. I have been trained for many different departments and do something new almost everyday. I have learned how to do checkout, how to make arrangements/bouquets. Lastly, to be more organized as well as learned the basics of customer service. Management had good days and bad days with their employees, as does every company. The hardest part of the job would be being crossed trained. When you're trained for multiple departments and ever department needs you, it's difficult to be pulled in every direction at once. The most enjoyable part is being able to be creative in Floral."
good,Nice place to work friendly staff great location. competitive pay...good for students just starting on their first job................................
good,"The other departments besides the deli seem great.  I have heard from co-workers that they really like the people they work for.  However, the deli is another story.  I was advised from another manager that I should move on and find another job.  His reasoning was it would take two years for me to get a decent raise and the sweat and the effort that I was putting forth would not be rewarded.  So to sum things up deli no, any other department is good."
good,"I worked for the Safeway in Duvall, WA for over 3 years. I started as a courtesy clerk and moved up to a food clerk, assisting other departments as needed. The community there is pretty good, but upper management (district/corporate level) has a slight negative effect on the store as a whole (from what I observed). Good for a starting job, but recommend not making a lifelong career in Safeway (though this particular store isn't bad for it)"
good,"It's really easy to get stuck at Safeway, but it's a great place to start and get some experience in the real work. The relationships are top notch. It can be very stressful, and your experience will definitely depend on the store you end up at, but if you work hard you'll be appreciated and be able to make it a really great place to go professionally."
good,"This place is all about learning customer service. I can't say they do a perfect job of teaching individuals how to change their attitudes, but the tools are all there from training to experience with customers and Safeway definitely gets people from all walks of life. "
good,"Good company to work for...people overall are nice...wish it paid more money to its non-union employees...the company pays weekly...and they offer health, dental, 401k benefits"
good,"i had a bad fallout with one of the managers, she was new and didn""t like my work habits i guess i don't know very well because she was just yelling at everything i did and i couldn't take it i had built a report with the main manager but i just couldn't handle her however safeway did say that i was rehirable."
good,"Being comparitively inexperienced, I learned a lot of new things here. All my collleagues helped and supported me a lot in exploring and learning new concepts."
good,"staff meeting every morning for amount of imports coming in then chosen for job task either poultry,veg, ETC, placing orders for the right destination with the tickets attached, finalizing order is correct for shipping."
good,The work day can either be really easy or really tough. Customers can be demanding but I stayed at this company for 5 years just because of those I worked with. Everyone was friendly and treated each other like a close friend or family and that helps a lot when you're working a day that seems like everything that could go wrong will go wrong.
good,I was a Courtesy clerk at Safeway. My time was productive and i gained great customer service skills to add to my background. They're multiple possessions available if you're of age.
good,"While it's rare for those with professional aspirations to stay in retail, it certainly makes for a great place to start as a young person getting involved in the workforce. Safeway is a company that I would recommend to someone getting their start young with, as they are fair but realistic in their treatment of their employees, and there is indeed early forms of advancement that rewards effort and ingenuity. The work is not complicated overall, but there is a rewarding increase in difficulty as one's position rises."
good,"Overall, Safeway was a good company to work for.  The work was varied and interesting, and there was always a good balance between work and home.  However, pay and benefits were not great."
good,Originally a student part timer it was easy to progress to a managerial role with effort. Looking back it was a fairly stress free job as long as early starts were not an issue.
good,Enjoyed interaction with customers and being able to help customer. Didn't like Union or hours given to me. Altogether had trouble providing for my family.
good,"It's a good place to get your foot in the door to the workforce. They're very lineant on new-hires and there's always work, stable pay and opportunities for advancement are prominent."
good,I learned to work alone and in a group. I also learned customer service and to be patient with people. Safeway was a great learning experience because it taught me to be resourceful and adaptable.
good,"Minors are able to get a job and gain skills to be employable elsewhere. It is easy to advance within the store if you are motivated and a hard worker. One of the most difficult tasks is dealing with the ever changing moods of the public, while always being courteous. This is a valuable tool to learn, that will be used throughout life."
good,I enjoyed working for Safeway. Management are very understandable and flexible. Although customers are aggressive over coupons. Not alot of room for advancement.
good,"I really enjoy working at safeway, except they have decided anyone who has been employed under a year is not entitled to ANY hours at all. I went from working a 40 hour week to now working 0 hours. sad but I'm going to have to find another job. thats what you get as part time i suppose!"
good,"Competing for hours can be very stressful. The hardest part is just staying on task. The most enjoyable part is interacting with customers. Management there kinda sucks, they dont notice the hard work you put in. They play favorites."
good,"Safeway was a lot of fun but the the only downside was the the hours were vary inconsistent. One week id only work 20 hours and the next a full 40. Every person there had a great attitude, the management was always making our jobs fun."
good,I have learned form this job how to process fast with good quality of work. What I liked about this job is that my co-workers were from different backgrounds.
good,"It was a good place to work, my coworkers were nice, they included everyone, no judgement or gossip was thrown around and overall it was a wonderful first job opportunity. I quit because I needed more hours and a different schedule but I don't regret working there."
good,"Safeway was a great place to work,or so I hear, before they merged with Albertson's. I was employed during the transition period while the companies merged. There was a lot of chaos, and confusion, from the head office, down to the district and store management. This level of confusion with those in charge had a negative trickle down effect on the employees. I found the confusion frustrating and ridiculous."
good,"I worked here starting as a teen, and continued into adulthood. They provided excellent customer service training, It was also union driven with great employee support."
good,Safeway is a great place to work. The employees are fun to work with and the management are an outstanding group to interact with. Even with difficult people you still must act professional and respect their wishes.
good,Safeway was willing to train me to be a cake decorator which was a huge blessing. enjoyed all the fun things we had to create and the bakery manager was great!
good,"A typical day at work would be me bagging groceries and cleaning bathrooms, the management was sub par and leaved a lot to be desired. Overall the job gave me some useful skills of talking with people and interacting with coworkers and multi-task and work in a fast-paced environment. work in outdoor parking lots, including ability to be exposed to weather conditions, including extreme heat or cold and rain ."
good,Most of the women working at the local safeway are older so as a teen it wasn't a very social job however it is often busy which helps the shift go by
good,Overall good company. Balancing work life and regular life can be hard at times. Best place to have great customer service. The customer service there is the reason customers comes back.
good,"working for Safeway was a good job to have while I was going to college. Most of the other employees were all very nice. Of course, this was 25 years ago."
good,Safeway is ok to work for but the management expect the world from you. enough is never enough and they dont like to help out much. nothing hard about job it just the management.
good,"Safeway was very good about providing training. Anytime you advanced in the company it was optional to go for training, but was recommended. During my sixteen years of employment I went for food safety and sanitation training, work place violence and harassment training, payroll and schedule writing and many more. I would take this training and hold classes at safeway, as this was part of my job. "
good,I was a manager at this company a total of 8 years out of the 10 years I spent with the company. I enjoyed this job very much. I left due to relocation. I was in charge and over saw operations by corporate and handled 500+ associates daily
good,"Safeway taught me patience, great customer service skills, and how to work well with others. The hardest part was working to their A+ standards with little or no help."
good,"Started as part time high school. Got me through university, the relationships I build will last a life time. It has changed a lot with Sobeys take over in a bad way."
good,"This was my first job, I had a lot of stress at first working here. After working for a while I started to get used to the chaos and busy days. I gained quite a bit of experience working here it was a perfect starting job for me."
good,Safeway has a good atmosphere to work. You have opportunities to move forward in the company. Safway is a fun place to work and the benefits are good.
good,"Management was great for the most part. Location was great. Worked for a top performing location in the southwest (downtown phoenix). Pay is weekly, overtime is available, many employees have been with the company for many years. I unfortunately did not last too long due to working a second job and going to school full time. Great reliable all around job for anyone."
good,"nice and friendly place to work, always busy, If you want to learn lot of room for that. sometimes difficult to go with the senior staff who dont want to change."
good,"A typical day for me started out rather uneventful cleaning up the outside of the store, making sure all the carts were in their stalls for new customers, occasionally bagging a customers groceries. Unless I was in the Deli then there were salads to put out meats and cheeses to slice, hot foods to cook and making sandwiches."
good,Its a very enjoyable job with people who care. My co-workers are amazing and the customer service is outstanding. I learned how to communicate with people.
good,"For a retail job, this was a decent place to work. The management was great; they treated me like a person and were willing to listen to my concerns and answer my questions. The other employees were very nice and willing to help whenever I needed it. As is typical of a summer job (in my experience), I had terrible hours and no benefits. It was difficult to get any time off for family vacations, even if I planned a month in advance, and even though I said I couldn't work Sundays, I somehow ended up with Sunday hours anyway. But whenever I had a problem with my schedule, I could always talk to management about it and they would work with me to fix it."
good,"Safeway tries to create a certain company culture but it is always up to individual employees to practice this culture. The employees were all decent people, some were more fun to work with than others. I think the store manager was over-worked, and she was not friendly towards employees. I worked there only for a few months but overall I enjoyed my co-workers, although the work itself was pretty boring and repetitive."
good,"I have worked at a Safeway Deli for only 1 year, but the experience, skills, and knowledge I have gained make it feel like a lifetime. Some customers (and admittedly, some employees) soured my experience- but didn't ruin it. I genuinely, at the core of myself, love working here. It's a shame it isn't a viable source of income to sustain myself (you must reach journeymen status to do so, which takes some time) otherwise I would be comfortable growing within the company for many years as I go to school."
good,"My opinion working as a service courtesy clerk for Vons is a challenging position although at the same time i do enjoy meeting new customers every time i arrive at work i learned to not be so quick to work tasks out quickly so that i don't mess up because there's so much to do which i feel is the hardest part of my job and completing most things in a timely manner i am a people person and i  will be willing to help and talk with a few customers that are in need of assistance,my coworkers as i known them since working for Vons are cool in their own way"
good,"Stalk groceries and run the cash register. It a easy job, just have to stay organized and do what is ask from me. I'm surrounded with nice co-workers and when its a busy day it goes by pretty quick."
good,This employer still has union for workers. Those union benefits are nice to have. Regular benefits don't include very much. Nice clean grocery store with friendly staff.
good,"Though the environment isn't always friendly, Safeway and its union takes care of its employees. You will be given good job security and flexibility with attendance. The pay starts out very low but will be raised with advancement."
good,"No breaks, no lunches, 12-13 hour shifts..."
good,My typical day starts off with checking around the store making sure everything is kept up. The other Co workers usually keep more to them selves unless a customer has a problem or there is a mess. The hardest part of the job was trying to resolve an issue with an unruly customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when things were clean and customers and management would show up and be satisfied with their overall shopping experience.
good,"When I checked out customers, it was fast paced. Most of the time, I was always doing something. This was different when I and to work late, but that wasn't a concern. What was a concern was the amount of hours I was working. Over time when I was working, I was doing stuff automatically instead of being bumbling in the beginning."
good,"I work on the bakery department, I was a baker for about 4 to 6 years I had to step doen due to not doing my job right which I wasn't given the optuon to due my job right as a ful fleged baker because thwu alwasy brought in a floater knowing darn well I knew how to due the dough cycle that sucks and been trying to get back to being a baker. But over all the crew is cool bump heads ever now and then but that's what makes our crew great."
good,i was not there that long but everybody was very friendly and helpful. pretty simple job to do and kept you very busy. this is a great job for young peope as a good first job
good,"This job would be recommended for someone thats still in high school, or maybe a part time job. the workers there are great by the way. always looking for the good in others."
good,"The manager position at Safeway pharmacy is a very demanding position.  It requires you to maintain accuracy and accountability of  the pharmacy pertaining to laws, rules and regulations.  I manage a crew of 5 people (1 staff pharmacist and 4 technicians).  I have been in management since 2004 and understand the importance of maintaining the daily operations of a retail pharmacy and abide with all standards that are required that are mandated by state and federal laws and guidelines."
good,"faced bread wall"
good,"Safe was my first job while I was still in highschool and they did a great job of working around my school schedule. I learned the ways of superior customer service while working there. Safeway was a great place to work and the colleagues there were even better, even while management was having issues."
good,I was a manager of a Starbucks kiosk and had little to no oversight from higher up unless they had to interfere. this was nice in the way that I could mold my kiosk into what I wanted since they had no knowledge of Starbucks but this became aggravating when I did need help and had no support.
good,"A typical day at work consist of looking at our production shelf and determining what needs to be filled or if I'm on pizza duty, I would be checking to see what pizza's need to be filled as well. In the deli department, I interact with customers on a daily basis; whether it's weighing sandwich meat, serving salad, or making a sandwich for the customer."
good,The working environment  was warm and friendly . The managers did a great job of carrying out tasks assigned even though the store was under staffed at times.
good,"Worked with multicultural people. Delivering at grocery stores.Safeway is a great company to work for, I wish they were on the East Coast."
good,"Enjoyed working with the public, serving others, fixing food, filling orders, and setting up the food cases. Loved cooking, and making food."
good,"Typical day would start off with bagging groceries, sweeping floors, collecting carts, then bagging more groceries, its just a cycle of that throughout your shift. I learned o be very patient and know that either way the costumer is always right. Hardest part was putting carts away in very hot weather or pouring rain. Best part was seeing regular costumers daily and connecting with them."
good,"I get to the store at 12am take the grocery idioms off the truck unwrap the plait and start working the idioms to the floor. "
good,"The work environment here is pretty good. Management can be difficult to reach and it is often not clear to whom you should report anything to or who to ask if you have any questions about your tasks. They are very reasonable and accommodating for needs of the staff (within reason) and with a few exceptions the staff consists of friendly, helpful people."
good,"I loved my job, looked forward to working everyday, also regular customers were great. I was working right under my manager so there was always new opportunities coming my way. I think the hardest part of my job was not  being able to make everyone happy. The most enjoyable part was having the chance to make a difference in everyone's life."
good,"Clock in check check the chart and find out I am on cart duty and floor sweeps because Iam the only courtesy clerk. so I put on the cart vest go to back room to get the broom. sweep four aisle clean Get called up to bag and or a carry out call. After I help the costumer I gather I couple carts and put them in the cart lot. I would even take plastic bags from customers and recycle them for them. Hardest two thinks where cleaning up really, smelly gross messy on the store floor and also helping out drunk customers that smelled of alcohol and yelling in the store.I learned ever supervisor  and manger are different."
good,"you get job security, but coworkers were not motivated enough, I was able to earn a lot however for working there. the most enjoyabe part was doing what I liked most interpreting and translating books. i enjoyed it a lot."
good,great atmosphere to work in depending on management and what department you work in.my coworkers where mostly friendly.
good,"Safeway is a good place to work. A typical day at work involved serving customers on the check stand, advertising promotions and answering any questions customers had. I thoroughly enjoyed working with my co-workers and interacting with the public."
good,"A typical work day is filled with a lot to complete. Time management is a must, and delegation helps you get these tasks completed in a timely manner."
good,"Great Union."
good,The work environment at Safeway was enjoyable and safe. Everything was always organized and worked like a machine. Every day was busy but the great co-workers and management team helped relieve any issues that would emerge.
good,was a great job great people the job itself just wasn't for me i enjoyed talking with the people and the staff i worked with
good,Working overnight as a night stocker with a small four man team taught me how to manage my time and work under pressure. It was a great experience with great management.
good,"Work most of my shift in the express check-out 15 items or less."
good,it was a fun great place to work. the job was great to keep busy i was always on the go and i really like that but of above all i got 40 hours every week
good,"I learned many skills working at Safeway, the most valuable one being Customer Service.  I worked for 12 years in customer service before the job was eliminated. I than went into marketing.  I enjoyed every part of my job in marketing, I learned advertising skills, payroll, scheduling and much more."
good,"A typical day at work would be depending on the job title I had for that day but if I had to multitask between jobs because of illness or other things, my favorite part of the job was multi tasking because not only did I get to help the customers, I was able to help co-workers with prioritizing with tasks that were at hand. I have learned to multitask, prioritize and to communicate.  The management at Safeway were supportive, understanding and compassionate.  The hardest part of job was my store being sold to Haggens and going under and losing my family.  The most enjoyable was having the family and still communicating with them both customers and co-workers."
good,"Very friendly environment with very helpful and flexible managers as well as co-workers who only want to help you perform better during work hours. Everyone helped each other with whatever was needed as well. Some of the co-workers however, weren't the best to work just because of the simple fact of them being lazy but were the management was able to take matters in those situations very easily. Also that was a problem that quite a handful of people would very accessional steel from the store and us as workers cant to anything about it besides the management which aren't always there to stop theft due to the training they do. If that training was shown to the rest of the workers, less theft would happen because they as workers would be able to stop most of it"
good,For anyone who is wanting to get their feet wet in grocery retail this is a great place to work. The staff at my location were great at making sure you got all you needed for training and learning their rules and regulations.
good,"A typical day is good at my job, I've learned customer services skills and other great skills at safeway. The Management is ok could be better in some ways though. My co-workers are great, hard-working and fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is serving customers food. The most enjoyable part is learning about food and what I have to do as an employee to make sure all goals and jobs are done and for-filled by the end of the day."
good,"Overal, Safeway is a wonderful place for your first job. A typical day at work is like any other day, you have your good day's and you have your bad. I've learned that you're not always right, most of the time it's the machines mess up and not the customers cards. My co-workers are wonderful people to be around, they're always there to listen to your stories, and they really make your work ethic much better each time. The hardest part about the job is when you're very low on staff sometimes, and there's not a whole lot of people to handle the job correctly and you're left running around way too much. Best part about my job is getting to chat with strangers about their days, and getting to know your regular customers that come through your cashier till all the time. You get to meet new people among your co-workers and just expierence a great time."
good,"I did so many different things at Safeway. They afforded me the opportunity to work in the following departments: Deli;Gas station;Cashier;overnight stock;price change/inventory and general merchandise dept. I was always very busy. The culture at Safeway was always that of a very diverse ethnic culture and one that was sort of a home away from home environment. The hardest part about working there was all the different shifts I had to work in any one given week sometimes graveyard, swing, day, and early day shifts all in one week. The most enjoyable part of working at Safeway was the fact that I was able to gain so much experience in so many different departments."
good,"Safeway was a fun work place to start providing myself with stability, the best part of the job was being able to interact with customers and learn some great customer service skills that will help me out with other jobs. I met some awesome people and enjoyed my time there but I just wanted to explore other options and experience something different."
good,i really did enjoy that they work with you with your schedule. but sometimes you need more hours and they don't always give you more. but the have good flexibility
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday, I managed  the Customer Service Desk. I would help customers with returns and exchanges."
good,its a good place to start off as your first job. You get to experience some hardship but at the end its totally worth it. there are a lot of friendly employees who you can make friends with easily. overall its a good place for part time workers trying to find a quick and busy body job.
good,"This is a great opportunity to get a look into a big company and how it functions. It can be busy and stressful but it teaches you that much more on working in retail. It's also a union job which is both good and bad depending on your oppinion of unions. Personally, i've never had to utilize my union representative except to learn how to acquire my benefits. Overall, I think it's a wonderful opportunity for anyone willing to work hard and wear a smile to work."
good,"It's been a great experience to work around a group of people that are non-egotistical and supportive."
good,"A day at work is helping my customers with whatever they need and fixing any problem that way they want to keep coming back. "
good,"Great place to work. Had a second job at the time and were very accomodating of that. Sometimes difficult to get hours, lots of employees, and as I was a new employee, hours were given to them before me. So the hierarchical nature of the employee organization made it a bit difficult for me. Shift work meant irregular hours, but that was fine by me, I needed as much work as possible. I was kept very busy, which I enjoyed."
good,Most of the pharmacy employees care about doing a good job for the public they serve!  I have had other customers from other Safeway pharmacies while on vacation  come to us because of their pharmacy's reputation of taking care of their customers.
good,"Good employees."
good,i learn through this job about how to hard work help. i also communicate different people. i learn how to make to care coworker and how to help them.
good,Good place to work if its your first job or you plan to stay fro a while. (i.e 10 plus years) management could be better and cause its union they take half your paycheck.
good,"Before the Merger with Albertsons, this was a great environment to work at.  Management was good and there were many opportunities for growth."
good,"It was a great place to work, I didn't work there for very long, but it was a good start for experience, and they're pretty relaxed as long as you do what you're supposed to."
good,"The job itself was good. The managers really cared about their employees, and I liked the work environment. Advancement is promising due to it being a union, however with it being graveyard shift I just physically wasn't able to continue working, although they would have made me a permanent employee."
good,"Safeway is a great starting point, and my store has a welcoming feel. Although, like any retail job environment, you run into Debbie downers and negative Nancys. I've flittered through different departments, trying to see what fits me, and right now as a cashier, it's the closest to the 'perfect' fit that I have found. Seafood and Fuel didn't have the customer interaction that I'd hope for and Courtesy clerk - there really was no stability."
good,"Almost all of my co-workers were really nice people, who I could count on to have my back when i needed them. Management was usually good and always firm on the dress code. A typical day at work at safeway was cold (because I was in a cold department), quite often boring or dead (during the week), and usually streesful or pain in the butt.  The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with the customers or the constant cold. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely working with my co-workers. I learned to work at a fastpace especially when it was busy."
good,I had a good morning schedule great co-workers did office bookeeping and was office manager I started bagging grocerys and worked my way up.
good,"coworkers get me through the day. work can be a little rough because i am a hard worker and care too much when others dont hold up their end because i believe we are all a team. i also do believe that you would probably have that problem at most places. overall decent place to work at. they work with my school schedule and for the most part, havent done me wrong."
good,A typical day of work consists of daily  great customer service which taught me how to deal with people and to conduct myself in the right manor. With the help of my Co workers and excellent management it made the hardest part of my job more easier which was dealing with customers which turn out to be the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I have learned how to tackle unique challenges and who are offered substantial opportunities that, together, produce fulfilling and exciting careers in a wide variety of fields. Given more information and fully understanding what is instructed to become a better employee. Taught how to greet our customers and learned that service is number one growing in a company."
good,"Being in the deli was a lot of hard work,aswell as being very busy. I was constantly working on my feet for long periods of time. I learned something new everyday and, the management was super friendly. One of my favorite parts about working there was the fact that everyone was so friendly and welcoming. I had wonderful co-workers who would always help when needed, but the most challenging part would be to keep up to the costumers at times. We would have many rush lunch hours, and could become very over wehlming."
good,"High paced Environment, fun and challenging. Excellent co-workers. Eventhough the work is somehow repetitive, every day there are challenging and different situations. Great opportunity to meet and deal with customerws from different multicultural backgrounds."
good,Come work a 4-8 hr. shift with helpful employees and nice customers. Was a fun and interesting job experience. Has a good work environment and the warm small town feeling of a market.
good,"fast paced most days. learned from everybody. made friends fast from all departments. learned all cleaning and health requirments. as well as operating specific heavy machinery, managment was fun, and understanding while teaching new skills. all co workers were friendly and helped to lend a hand. hardest part was the physical just keeping pace."
good,I had learned lots about the communicate with the customers. they all had different culture and understand how to deal with them. foods are very challenge and have lots of safety code
good,Safeway provides a great work environment which supports a healthy living style. There's classes that are offered to help us better work our skills.
good,"a typical day would be come in and make sure all customers are satisfied if not possible try to find a solution if an empyloee does not come in cover the shift to the best of your ability or have someone come in early or stay later do what is needed to make the company work to its best ability.consult your management team to see if you need to cover the shift or if the production is down you do not need to.i enjoyed meeting new people everyday and makin their shopping exprience the best you can. i enjoyed my co-workers, but like most jobs there is tension among some"
good,Safeway was a great place to work. All of my Co workers was very nice helpful and friendly. If I had the chance I would work there again. I think the hardest part was making sure my work tactics was good. Loved workin a challenging j I b being as though I was c ty he only female.
good,Been with the company for three years and I have nothing bad to say. I have enjoyed my job through these years and I would do it again.
good,"Work/life balance is good.  Excellent for diversity, 12 Employee Resource groups allow you to network with people who share the same interests as you.  Café is good and reasonable, gym is great.  The people at Safeway are the best part about coming in to work everyday.  Work can be stressful, but you learn to manage that."
good,"I liked the type of work I did, but the coworkers and customers were often very unfriendly and stressed out. I would not recommend this job honestly."
good,This is a very good company. Great management and employees. Work life balance was good no real problems.
good,"Work is always busy. With our little crew, we somehow push through and get everything done effectively and efficiently. I learned many things working here. I learned how to work with costumers better, assisting various types customers and adjusting my way of communication to each one of them. I learned the technical aspects of the produce department understanding the numbers and percentages that are calculated weekly and monthly and adjusted my way of working to improve those statistics. Working in the produce department, I developed a large data bank of produce product knowledge like knowing how to pick certain fruits and vegetables, where they originated from, and how they are used along with knowing their growth seasons. I enjoy working with my coworkers. A lot of teamwork comes into play in our department. We divide the tasks depending on what comes in from our orders so that everything gets done properly and cleanly."
good,"I was just a helper clerk and courtesy clerk, but its an enjoyable place. time seemed to always go quickly."
good,A typical day at work included me being yelled at and talked down to in front of costumers about things I was not instructed on. I worked six out of eight hours alone most shifts with no one there to cover my break. When too sick to come in and work with food my Manager expected me to come in. Though I did enjoy other aspects of my work environment.
good,"I come in and clock in  then i go outside and bring in the carts. After that i  come back in and walk through the store and bathrooms to find and sweep/clean up glass,trash,spills etc.  Wen I am done with that,  I come and bag the  customers stuff at the check out lines."
good,Fortune 500 company that appreciates innovation. Perishable working place
good,"loading and unloading of trucks, operating of multiple machine, break down of plastic and wooden totes, hand stacking of metal drums in trucks, handling and disposal of waste products, daily QA inspections, inventory of products that come in, daily clean up of full work area, multi-tasking of projects daily"
good,Safeway is a good company to work for you are able to balance your work and life around. The managers are always looking for employees who are interested in moving into management.
good,"Every shift I work is relatively normal with fluctuations of either it being busy or a slow day. Every day though is quite enjoyable whether it's helping customers or bringing food out from cooking it in the back, or even preparing food for the customer. I learn something new nearly every shift I work, and I personally love stocking the food and any supplies need like crates in the back. Moving around is my absolute favourite. My coworkers are always great when it comes to either just asking for help or a question about how to do something, to joking around with and cleaning up when we have a little bit of time. The only difficult part about the job is the very little hours a week (between 9-13 a week)."
good,"-Scanning customers groceries along with helping customers with their customer service needs "
good,"A very traditional brick and mortar company, but with a lot of opportunities in different sides of the business. Every department varies a lot between one another, but my department tried to keep things upbeat within the corporate atmosphere."
good,I made a lot of friends working at Safeway and also had so many good and bad experiences as well. My customer service skills improved a lot while working at Safeway. Safeway was a good company to work with and I was actually getting paid more there than my current job but it was not my dream job.
good,"No benefits because no full-time but people were awesome very busy not a lot of down time, The Best Bakery in town Management was amazing :)"
good,"I am a main closer, working mostly 12-9 shifts, so my duties involve; stocking, heavy lifting, withstanding extreme temperatures, practicing safety, food preparations, customer service, working well with others, cashier, cleaning, and keeping a positive attitude. Vons has a very positive atmosphere, all employees are very friendly and helpful. Their attitudes are very contagious creating an enjoyable work environment. I've learned that the attitude you exude can change attitudes of those around you. Vons also likes to see their employees succeed and they provide all employees opportunity to advance by cross training them if desired and also motivate them to do so. There still are sorts of challenges  Vons employees face every day, but as long as you do everything in your power to help coworkers and customers, with a smile, those challenges are easily overcame."
good,"Work is always pretty productive, plenty to do and never really a dull moment especially during the holidays, i also enjoy the people i work with, i try to get along with my fellow coworkers, and i like being around the customer as well."
good,"Always busy, learned a lot about data analysis, check fraud"
good,"Meeting new people, communication, my coworkers were around but kept distance , hardest part would be standing in one place for hours at a time"
good,"I loved coming into work and feeling appreciated. The work was always laid out for you but, training was pretty scarce. Overall I enjoyed working for such a great company."
good,i enjoy the atmosphere there for the majority team oriented work place at times but most jobs are like that
good,"Always work to do sometimes overwhelming, but good first time job experience."
good,"Each day is not the same, there is always new ideas and task to take on, which is a plus for me."
good,"pleasant,  fast paced. the incentives are good and it is a team enviorment."
good,"A typical day a safeway was to bag groceries,do go backs sweep collect carts, clean bathroom, produce area. At safeway i learned how to communicate with customers better i also learned what it takes to servive in the retail business. Management was okay could have been better they rules was off at time in the things they say. Some co-workers was good friends of mines so it made it easy to get through the day. The hardest thing about working for safeway was always trying to please everyone everyday. The most enjoyable was i got to meet good people that's still friends with me until this day."
good,"Safeway is a decent company, that could improve on some of their employee policies, such as water being allowed at the check stand. I learned customer service, stocking, pricing tagging, and more advanced cashiering because of PLU codes. Management was acceptable. My coworkers were wonderful people, and I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of my job was being stationary on my feet for 8 hours a day, with little room to move. The most enjoyable part was customer interaction, and having my own favorite customers who came through my line to see me."
good,"At a typical day I would come in to my duty as Customer Service Advisor I would help customers with their services and provide more services to be done to their vehicle that was noted in our system. I learned how to do my job better and keep customers stratified with the services they asked for. I communicated with my manager on the daily on how i can better my work ethic and how to solve problems with my customer or employees. My co-workers and I had a wonderful relationship and we worked fast and simple as a team. The hardest part of the job was doing an oil change on a diesel because, you would have to get directly underneath the vehicle and pop the drain plug. The most enjoyable part on the job was coming into work, because everyone had fun, and got along well which made the job easier and enjoyable."
good,It seemed that Safeway as a whole was a great company but the particular store that I worked at needed work.
good,"I was lucky enough to land a job in the meat/seafood department of Safeway."
good,"Always stayed busy, Learned ways to control shrink to save company money, learned how to stay communicating with co-workers even the ones who don't want to communicate much, Every day I would come in count all cash drawers from day before perform the cash deposit distribute new cash drawers, have a team meeting to get motivated and prepare for a great day for customer service, get on a conference call to communicate with other stores on ways to improve my store, I learned a lot about being a leader and being effective."
good,"When I started working for Safeway, Inc. I had no experience cutting meat.  I started as a seasonal cashier and was promoted into the meat department about 2 1/2 months later as an apprentice meat cutter.  During my apprenticeship the learning curve was very steep.  It was a two year apprenticeship to become a journeyman butcher.  My pay was increased substantially every 1000 hours, without overtime that's about 25 to 28 weeks (6 months).  It was a very learning intensive program (the apprenticeship program used to be a leisurely 7 years) but the work was very satisfying."
good,"On an average day I run stock on the dairy department starting at the fridge making sure everything is faced and loaded onto their proper pallets or on the fridge stock floor ( or L). Then moving out to cover eggs, and hauling out the old egg cages and milk crates with a pallet jack. Often i will have to work the bailing machine and wrap/remove completed bails of cardboard. I restock beverages in all cold cases, work the rest of of the dairy, yogurt, butter, cheeses distributed to the other departments etc. Temp logs to make sure all cold storage is working effectively or if it needs to be cooled within acceptable levels. Very constant heavy lifting and movement, if there is nothing left to do in my department i restock aisles or help individual departments with various things, stocking, labeling, and cleaning."
good,"cashier"
good,Safeway is a wonderful place to work a family enviorment to be in. The customers was great i rarely had a problem there. The hardest thing was being on time there.The enjoyable thing about my job was my employees.
good,Busy; would like to have more stable hours. Everything else is fine.
good,"Learned How To Make Sandwiches,Salads,Pizza; sold meats and cheese. Learned how to slice the meat or cheese too either stock up on meat or cheese running low. Or If A Customer wanted the meat or cheese sliced at a certain size"
good,I can only review what I remember.  I remember a friendly environment and friendly people.  Safeway was always nice.  Great customer service and in a small town everyone knew everyone.
good,Well structured union environment to work in. The management did well overall and most of the employees have been there for a long time.
good,"My typical day at work was working on the cash register the whole work day. When it was slow I did other taks around my register but it was a very busy store. I learned how to be more social and have better communication with customers and co-workers alike. The management was mostly fine for the six years plus I was there, there was good times and bad but mostly good. I had wonderful co-workers to work with always full of energy and happy, friendly to work with a well. The hardest part of the job I would have to say would be to stay calm in cases like before a major snow storm or other wheather is about to hit or dealing with a very rude and un-friendly customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was to have most customers but all the co-workers be always nice and very fun to work with so that made me feel happy at work."
good,"I enjoy my job very much. A typical day for me includes processing flowers and helping customers with any problems they have in the store, and assisting them with their flower needs. My Favorite part of my job is being creative and talking to my regular customers."
good,It is nice to be working in an environment in which people are genuinely hard working and care more about work to be done than other distractions.
good,"Safeway is a big Corporation and having be part of a union really help me in regards to pay and benefits.  Overall, Safeway is a good company to work for."
good,"I did Learn a lot of different thing's in Different Department's, and Always Administered, World Class Customer Service. and Anticipating what customer's may need."
good,CA. is mainly Asian style cooking. I met a lot of awesome people that im still friends with until this day.
good,I worked for Safeway for 7 1/2 years. I started as a cashier and within 6 months I moved to management/customer service. After about 5 years and some management training I decided to become a front end manager. I did that for 2 years and loved it. I got great experience and great benefits.
good,Safeway is a good company to work for. Very friendly staff who like to help people and have good customer service
good,Enjoy the comraderie and helpfulness of co-workers.  All levels of management work together and are accessible.
good,Very good company to work for. Staff and management are extremely friendly and professional. You are treat as a part of something big.
good,"I enjoyed Safeway as a way to start out my job experience. It allowed me to learn more interpersonal skills which was nice. I learned that no matter what type of job you are in, you'll deal with the occasional crazy person/situation. The management at Safeway was great...always felt like I could talk to any of the managers & bring up personal issues when they became present. My co-workers were great as well, everyone genuinely likes interacting with people & we always found the fun in simple grocery store tasks. The hardest part of the job was being a courtesy clerk... I know you have to start from the bottom & work your way up, but this position was the most demanding. It required you to pretty much be the slave to all the other departments... Having to be all over the store when called upon. It got tiring after a while, and at times you feel unappreciated. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to somewhat shadow each department when there was down time. If anyone needed a break, or some assistance, courtesy clerks are the first ones there. There's not really much room for advancement it seems like.. You can change departments, but to be someone higher up towards management, never really seemed like there were opportunities."
good,The Job was overall fun. They management were very considerate of me going to school and they worked around my schedule. Most of the people there were really fun and some were very lazy but because of unions they were able to still work.
good,"I enjoy working with Safeway however wages are quite low."
good,"Great job assisting with customer service, at checkouts, and other areas."
good,"Unloading of nightly shipments after store hours. stocked shelves in a timely manner independently. carrying up to 75 lbs consistantly, facing shelves, cleaning packaging. Observing, and removing expired or nearly expired/damaged goods."
good,"Great fortune 500 company with guaranteed hours."
good,Offers an abundance of opportunities for promotion and lateral moves.
good,"As a registered pharmacy technician for Safeway pharmacy, everyday was filled with the opportunity to assist people with their health related and personal needs. The knowledge I had allowed me to advocate for my customers and assure they received medications they needed even through times of economic hardships and rejections by their insurers. I learned how to be persistent, patient and to researcher different options to resolve issues and never settle for less. I learned about medication classes, uses, dosages, strength and their preparation for dispensing. The management was amazing they held the same passion for helping people and their families and went above and beyond to serve our customers. My coworkers held the same compassion and would strive to reach the best outcomes for every customer. The hardest part of the job was witnessing the ridiculous co-pays the geriatric population dealt with on a monthly basis and their inability to afford their prescriptions. At times, no matter what you did to resolve this, the situation remained. I enjoyed having the power to help people, to call their physicians and insurers and resolve issues my customers would give up on through frustration. I loved to listen to people and be a support for them through their stressful and joyful times."
good,customers are generally nice and kind. There is an open door policy with the management system. co-workers are fun to deal with. the most enjoyable part is when i received perks like free starbucks drinks when i collect many donations from the customers. Not really hard to work in safeway because they only allow me few hours in a week.
good,"I enjoyed working in grocery, not only did I learn and experienced working in every department of Safeway but I also enjoyed the fast pace of being a cashier. As a cashier I scanned items for each item the customer purchased and was able to provide customer service by talking to them and seeing what their needs were; whether it was needing help out to their car or assisting them to the location of any items they were looking for, also having some-what quick conversations with the customers while checking their items. I provided a receipt for each order including any coupons, greeted and asked if the customer was in need of any assistance and politely ending the conversation to see them again. I also worked nights from 11 pm to 8 am including a 1 hour lunch. Working nights I unloaded freight onto the store floor and placed each item on the pallet to the shelves while facing (Facing the item to show the front of the label) and checking for any expiration items.Not only did I do this but I was also working with the night manager and assisted by training new employees to learn the general routine,safety, procedures, and worked as the night cashier in our 24 hour store."
good,"I learned more about compounding at my store, which I am very thankful for. The hardest part about working for Safeway is the wait period for medical benefits, dental and eye insurance. After almost 5 years of working there will you end up with all three. The Union is good about raises and seeing that you are taken care of if something goes wrong. About 99% of the management for Safeway Pharmacy is amazing to work with, very fun and knows how to get the job done in a timely manner."
good,"Clean the warehouse with floor scrubber remove or load and unload some food product. I learned to use some equipment like standing forklift, electric pallet jack floor scrubber with water. My co-worker is very nice to be with if we have some issue we assure that we settle it before we go home. if all the deliveries is delayed that's the hardest part because were working with other department while were cleaning the warehouse. the enjoyable is the weekly meeting so! we can interact about some idea for the work"
good,Everyday gets very busy. Lots of multitasking and learning how to deal with the public. Keeping things fresh and clean. Following managment orders and working well along with many coworkers. The hardest part is keeping the checkout lines moving swiftly and the best part is having a customer leaving Happy!
good,"Demanding, competitive, driven towards performance. Plenty of on the job training as well as vocational training. Management positions always available."
good,Safeway is a good place to get an idea of what career you would like to eventually have. It is a good place to work when you are going to school because they often work around your busy schedule. I would recommend it to any college student who wants to make ends meet while they are going to school
good,Meat department Deli...I learned customer are always first and I liked my co-workers .Always willing to learn
good,"Typical day would begin reviewing if I shorted any products for sales and how to recover. Forecasting for upcoming promotions and working with vendors to get product in. Working and reviewing history of sales, aged product, new product launches. Making daily purchase orders for fulfillment, managing inventory lean but not enough to affect sales, turn product in time fashion. Some hard part of my job would include last minute ads, no time to get product in. Most enjoyable would be working with my coworkers as a team, and my vendors as well. Having a great relationship with both made my nob very enjoyable and gave the ability that working with both could not only help me but that I could help them."
good,"This company has great opportunities for advancement. A typical day sometimes was survival. It was an understaffed place to work due to limited budgeting. At times I was the Manager, cashier, bagger, cart pusher, all at the same time."
good,I really enjoyed this job and as a part time position and a second job for me it was a lot of fun!
good,"A typical day in the position of overnight stocker  is very routine and physically tiring too. The job requires a lot of standing , pushing , pulling , lifting  , and carrying throughout the shift. I learned the effects of a full-time job with this type of employment."
good,I loved going to work until we got a new manager. They were no longer able to work about my school schedule so when I had to leave work to go to school I got in trouble. I learned how to work hard and a lot of skills with cash registers and espresso machines. I loved being around the customers and helping them. Making drinks and getting to talk about the coffee was also fun.  
good,Typical day at work would be just to help customers with their orders. I learned how to handle money and how to use the cash register and learned alot of the codes of most products. Managment was good. Co-workers were all great because alot of them i went to school with. Hardest part was standing on your feet for so long but after a while i got use to it. Most enjoyable part was working with friends.
good,Stocking the product or grocery in a 8 hour time can be demanding but if you do the work it is as simply and easy. Get along with your crew and your manager and the night will go fine and easy
good,Safeway is an awesome place to get a career. If you have a strong work ethic you will be given the opportunity to further your career. 
good,"A typical day included scanning and making sure the price was correct, bagging groceries, asking the standard questions to my customer.Ensuring that all the customer's items were charged, watching always for B.O.B. (bottom of basket). Also included cleaning both inside and outside of store, rounding up the carts, "
good,The best part of my time with Safeway was the relationships I had with customers and other co-workers. The balance of my personal life and work would be at questioned. Management was always in transition and the goals of the company didn't match for what they would allow for labor.
good,"It is an interesting place to work, lots of fun and enjoyable people and environment. Management foes need to improve a little to create an equal work area"
good,"Loved it, Great management. could use more hours. But it was a nice place to work"
good,It was challenging It was my first managment job. It was probly the best expierance of my life. Safe way tought me sooo much. It's hard to even explaine what they did for my managment carrier
good,I learned how to be a team player and learned better work ethics at this job.
good,Typical Week consisted of a Monday through Friday 5am to 2pm
good,Good people.
good,Good job but not enough job security
good,"I enjoyed working for Safeway, the benefits were great and I learned a lot about myself and how to deal with conflict."
good,I felt like this was my second family. Very outgoing. Was able to live comfortabily
good,I really enjoy working for Safeway and gave the company some of my best years.
good,It was always busy there. The people there were friendly and i got along with everyone. The only thing I didnt really like about my job is that a few people were lazy so I had to do there jobs for them. Other than that it was a nice place to work.
good,This company was pretty awesome. I loved that you could talk to your boss without feeling like you couldn't bring anything to the table. Scheduling was pretty good but occasionally changed.
good,Good when there's hours. Ive learned how to run a shop. My managers took the time to show me alot. Ive got the chance to work at many different locations. The schedule is the hardest part. It felt good to provide the service to customers on a daily basis
good,working at Safeway was a good experience because you learn a lot only thing i didn't like about Safeway was there management
good,"stocking shelves, and checking all night untill close store closes then u lock up the store. and finish with shelves and order for the store. by then you open the store back up and check a little before you sign out."
good,if you can stay away from the work politics you will be very sucessful wit this company
good,"A normal day starts off with a mound of work to get caught up with. I have learned how to prioritize and multitask better then I could before. Management is very supportive and willing to work with everyone.I would have to say the hardest thing about my job is that there are some days we just don't have enough help. I really like my fellow co-workers and the environment in which I work, I also like being able to solve problems."
good,"I would come in at 11pm and start cleaning the store. I finished so quickly that I would ask the overnight manager if I could do more work. Of course! That's how I started stocking. I am an expert at stocking both perishable and non-perishable items. Overall, I enjoyed the additional challenges given to me."
good,I am willing to move in order to advance my carreer with Safeway!
good,"Flexible hours, laid back atmosphere, simple, repetitive job."
good,Hours always available
good,Working at Safeway was a joyful and good experience. it was constantly busy.
good,no huge complaints anything was mostly my doing if things doing go as expected.
good,"Fun, productive, and great work place until they changed management. It then became a terrible place. They brought in a new manager to remove employees with tenure."
good,"Well equipped with warming values for company and employees, different charities were in involved every week to raise through our customers loyalty. Available postions for working with other departments within store as well as commutes to additional store branches. Full days and enjoyable coworkers. Coffee shop customers were more difficult to assist but more than not had promising results and many were returning customers. Having the knowledge to train associates anywhere in the world."
good,"From my experience with the company, I learned quite about customer service relations and rapport. Also time management, prioritizing, and working to protect the safety of fellow co-workers and customers."
good,"Taking care of customer's with movies, lotto , money orders, returns, and western union. Also, computer work, managed 3-4 employees along with scheduling and maintaining the entire dept."
good,The only con of the job was the low wages. I really enjoyed every other aspect. I got along well with customers and staff. I moved up the ladder fairly quickly and was basically managing the service clerks for the whole store.
good,"I had a great time working for Safeway, especially when I got to work in the back doing merchandising and stock."
good,"I enjoyed the hardworking, and the fact that there always something to do. Working as a team. I annoyed the friends that I have made there that feel more like family. I learned how to multitask very well, as I am also now a professional in the field of customer service."
good,Safeway was a safe and fun environment to work in. I worked with great employees and very good managers. Gossip got the most of the employees. So I decided to quit not because I wanted to but because I had too. From carts to walking around the store my body couldn't take it. I wasn't really tired it was just my face was getting two toned from the sun. But other then that working at Safeway was a life time experience. If I could do it again with the same employees and the great customers I had to serve I would.
good,The only thing I dislike was that I hardly ever got lunches. I was only scheduled one if the supervisor said so. That meant I had to work 8 long hours at the register and not have a single break.
good,"a typical work day is to go to the fuel station check all pumps, pick up trash, fill buckets clean pumps to were they are clean. help customers on using the pumps with there club cards and credit cards. set for prepay for the pumps take payment for gas and other items. count out the money drawer after each shift. Check emails and reports each day. Call in for any help to the help station."
good,"Always providing outstanding customer service. The management was so-so i really enjoyed my co-workers because all my friends worked there. Job wasnt hard at all, but the most enjoyable aspect would be it was right by the beach."
good,"I enjoyed customer service. It can be challenging sometimes, but i loved it."
good,This is a part time weekend position and I enjoy seeing the customers and co-workers when I go to work.
good,In 2007 this company closed down several locations in las Vegas and left a lot of employees without work or with less than 20 hours a week.
good,"Great place to build up on your customer service skills. Working in the produce department has taught me about inventory, shrink, ordering, merchandising, marketing, forecasting, purchasing, profit margins,and more. The hardest part of the day is standing on my feet for 8 hours a day and constantly moving and lifting. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with customers."
good,Great place to work entry level is entry level but there are always ways to move up if you speak up
good,"Starbucks is a great part time or second job to have (the money is far from being enough, so there would have to be another income coming from somewhere else) It's honestly like hanging out at the coffee shop for a few hours, and you're getting paid for it!"
good,overall i would say my experience with this company has been positive. The hours are flexible which is nice if have alot of accomedations. The benefits are quite generous and the opportunity for advancement is there if you are willing to accept the responsibility.
good,"What you put in is what you got back, commitment and dedication go a long way."
good,Worked full time as both a staff pharmacist and as a pharmacy manager.
good,Good place to work did not get along with the manager. overall good work environment.
good,Good company to work for and management team very down to earth. Enjoyed my time at Safeway!
good,"It takes forever to get raises here and the pay makes it unlivable it California. My co-workers are great but, the pay makes the job depressing sometimes."
good,"I didn't realize how great I had it at Safeway. My manager and co-workers were some of the best people I've ever known, not only at work. Out of all the Pharmacy Tech jobs I have had Safeway is in the top 2."
good,"I learned the skills to work in face paced customer service, how to follow proper cleaning and cooking instructions, how to operate the p.o.s system. Management was great"
good,Overall it’s a good place to work. There is plenty of room to grow within the company you just have to put in the work. If you do your job you have nothing to worry about.
good,"Overall I liked working at Safeway, they were very flexible with your schedule and the benefits were great given I didn't work full-time. The benefits included; medical, vision and dental."
good,"Management was switching around a lot during my second year, and I started having problems with a particular employee on the night shift, I failed to defend myself and was terminated from the position, though I got good experience and know to go to the manager whenever there's even a question. Coworkers are not always sympathetic, labor is often shared or related to other's labor, and those issues need to be taken up with management when they become problematic. The job itself was good enough. Unfortunately the bakery manager only worked during the day shift."
good,A typical day for me was to clock in and check the catalog to see my hourly duties then to my first job of the day. I learned better costumer service and how to bag groceries. I thought the management could of been better just in the way we did some things around the store. There wasn’t really anything difficult but one thing was learning where everything in the store was located.
good,Safeway was a great company to work for and made their employees feel included and offered opportunity for growth in the company. The company made me feel included at all times.
good,I work part time over night putting merchandise on the shelf’s and organizing them when I’m finished. I work alone and have 9 aisles to do by myself. I work from 11pm to 7am.
good,"Start the day off just by helping customers by putting groceries in their car if needed, take items back to the respected shelves, sweep aisles, clean bathrooms, and bag groceries. I worked at two locations, one was very slow since it was in an elderly community, the other was busy since it was in a city. The hardest part of the job was being able to please customers in a scenario where I had to no control over the situation. The most enjoyable part is when customers come back due to customer service skills."
good,everyone at safeway is nice and outgoing. they always help when you need it but going threw computer training is a bit bad the safeways server is kind of slow.
good,"I like the place, it is a nice place, not the best because it is not something someone wants to do for the rest of your life but it gives you the experience and teaches you valuable things."
good,I came into the Abbotsford Safeway Deli in June in help them close because they were short staffed it was quite stressful doing sometimes very long production lists and helping alot of customers although the customers are very rude here but I did meet some good people The closing shifts are a little bit stressful because you closed by your self while serving customers it was a 1:30 to 10 pm but it was overall 4 stars the people who have been there longer always have priority in choice of shifts but if youre ne you can still get some 9 to 5:30 shifts
good,"Haven't worked in other departments but starbucks can be fun, until you're left alone and have to take orders and make drinks yourself then it is stressful and not worth the money. Hours are wack and resemble the ups and downs of a roller coaster with only split days off regardless of telling management you hate it."
good,"Work place was always relaxed not to busy but busy enough not to be bored, fun work stuff always felt included while working there, always had time for life and work while working there."
good,I loved working at Safeway due to the people I worked with. But I wasn’t happy with management not being flexible with my school schedule. But other than that Safeway is great for job opportunity and advancement
good,"Many challenges working with many different people,   dealing with grumpy. Rude customers and their rude remarks and demands, them getting upset because we are out of a product. Very annoying at times, but then seeing our regular friendly customers to brighten our day."
good,"I was the acting manager for 2 years, although promised I would be made manager. I was not promoted. I loved working there, and I put in a lot of overtime hours. I also worked up to 27 days straight at times."
good,"After being behind a desk since 17, I am enjoying the change and socialization."
good,"safeway is union so that's where it's main flaws lie. it makes it extremely difficult to let a bad employee go. because of that, a lot of the good workers get burnt out too quick."
good,I didn’t want to work there if i wasn’t getting paid correctly. Safeway wasn’t giving me enough hours in a week so i quit. If i got more hours i would have stayed there.
good,"The store is clean and sweep logs are maintained. Employees think themselves are family which is good. Current store manager is great, deals with problems in a snap."
good,"Maintaining store shelves "
good,I make coffee and clean and talk to customers. I learned how to be fast on my feet to multi-task. I also learned how to be patient and how to listen. management is good.
good,A typical day at work consists of 8 hours of work with a 1-hour lunch break. The hardest part of the job would be pushing carts and taking out the trash. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet while working. Almost all of the other employees are kind and will help you immediately.
good,Large amount of problems arose but were easy to solve as a team. The ability to overcome and battle through tough situations came easy with the crew I worked with.
good,"Employees are very friendly and try to help as much as possible, the managers are very understanding. Once you've worked at Safeway for a certain period of time, your hours can become very flexible, and even part-time employees get pretty good benefits. However, new employees don't have much say in which shifts they receive."
good,"Hard, stressful work, understaffed, no communication really. I like who I work with for the most part. Bakery manager doesn't really seem to care too much about his job or who works with him. Store manager is pretty chill and awesome"
good,Great place to work. Excellent training. I would strongly recommend this company. Honest feedback... I also think this survey is on the lengthy end and borders on annoying. Thx
good,I enjoy working for a place where management are more involved and treat employees well.  So far management seems very helpful and knowledgeable.  I really like it cause we are represented by an Union.
good,While I started working here there was a few bumps and bruises on the way because there were a few people that hated me on the job site but they didn't make me feel welcomed once I showed up. Once they got to know me and what I did for them a lot of them gave me perks and were more lenient with me in the workplace because I showed them I worked hard and was a happy go lucky kid. So I would say it would be a great experience to work there as a young teen but as You get older then I see it as a strict area and not a happy greeting place for you to work there.
good,"If you are 18 years old and like to work in fast-paced environments, then Safeway is for you. You meet a lot of wonder customers, and meeting coordinated time intervals are amazing."
good,"This was a unionized franchise, which I didn't appreciate that much, because I just needed a job. The typical day was on your feet all the time and doing labor that made you tired, scanning and cleaning, and whatnot. I learned a lot about time management and social skills. Being around people the entire time and helping them out, you need to work fast in order to make sure you are being as efficient as possible to get to the next customer while also making the previous customer feel taken care of. People had fun there. It's a grueling job but the people make light of it. It was fun to be there with a bunch of other people who understand. The hardest part of my job was being 18. I wish I had been older when I started there, I may have been able to climb the ladder faster. The most enjoyable part really was being around the people."
good,The work was very intense and stressful to a degree. Working with other people and customers was the fun part. There were no other real extra curricular activities within the company.
good,"When you first start out, you take a lot of computerized tests. Typically management and coworkers don't help you become familiarized with the store so you are in the dark with helping out customers when you are new."
good,I like working at Safeway there is a bit of management issues at times. I will say that I love everyone I work with and that really makes coming into work.
good,"A little tiring, customers can be hard to handle, some of the managers were hard to work with but it was a fun environment. It was pretty easy to remember the produce codes and there was a lot of help from the managers and other experienced cashiers."
good,"Overall a very good company to work for good benefits "
good,"People were cool there wanted to stay but wasn't getting enough hours less then 40hours a week hard work but great benefits Teamsters. "
good,Nice working there because of building relationships or fellow employees and customers! Was able to have my own space to knee organized. And was able to work with friends
good,"Learned a lot about customer service and working with different people but over all the jobs were really easy. The management was not that great but nonetheless I liked my managers at the time. Overall it was a great experiencing, I made a ton of friends and I had fun."
good,safeway was a fun place to work all in all it wasn't to bad was my second job starting out after high school so it was a fun learning experience  moved on to a different job because it wasn't paying enough
good,"it is an awesome company to start working after you graduate from school. they will work with your college hours, you have benefits and you will also be part of a union"
good,It was a pretty typical retail job. I worked in the bakery department and set out all of the merchandise. I filled cake orders and kept stock on the inventory.
good,Very reliable place too work but it may take years for any sort of pay advancement but when you do get a pay bump it is quite significant. Many different positions available.
good,Safeway was an ok place to work. It did however change when the merger with Albertsons took place. I did like Safeways policies better than the new Albertsons policies.
good,You do the best you can with what every your're handed and never complain. It's a blessing to have a Job anywhere that pay's enough to live on and not have any worries. I love working with people and meeting new people of all backrounds. I love learning new things while helping out where ever needed to make a different.
good,"A typical day at work involved bagging customer groceries, checking orders, providing customer service, selling lotto tickets, stamps, money orders, and completing western union purchases and payouts. The workers are great and the company is more than willing to work with your schedule."
good,Working at Safeway was usually an easy going day more than not it was so quick paced becuase of the low amount of staff during the time I worked there.
good,I worked my way up through different areas within Safeway. I was able to advance to higher paying positions as well as gain knowledge of different areas of Safeway.
good,"Very friendly work associates and friendly management. Sometimes you are left alone for long periods of time, but rarely. Work hours and breaks and schedules were very organized. Customers were very friendly for the most part. Required to work with cashier, restock materials, and learn how to make drinks very fast. The main struggle was that the training was very fast and some things you have to figure out on your own."
good,"I worked in several different departments at Safeway as a Cashier, Dairy Clerk, in Receiving and Frozen Food. I enjoyed working Dairy but I often was overexerting myself and not being appreciated for the extra work I completed."
good,When I started working 8 month's ago I was getting a tone of hours! Now its going on Christmas and Thanksgiving they cut are hours to almost nothing and there is people blow me that has a few more hours then I do this coming up week I'm getting 12 hr for the week now i don't know what the reasoning is and why there cutting everyone hours at work are getting cut but I do know its almost Christmas and how in am I going to do anything for Christmas or even pay my bills on this type of pay. When I got my job I was told that they would need to be my priory job so if i got another job they would need to work around my hours at Safeway I will be talking to the union about this but for now ill just do a review on the employee side of things. oh ya another thing is they keep telling me there going to get better well its going on 3 months and no change!!!
good,"Great place to work for, but you rarely see management and the supervisors are biased. More women are hired compared to men, sometimes they give you less hours, and have you try to do three things at once. The workplace culture is great, but they never prepare you for the seasons, and the people you meet are great people"
good,"There isn’t much to get excited about, unless you’re really into bagging groceries, pushing shopping carts, and taking out trash. If that’s you, you’ll love this job."
good,good place to start a career but you defiantly have to bounce around your shifts changing every week and hard to get full time spot it is nice once you get your inc they have a very good plan but first level is not  that great after a year you will receive dental
good,"I enjoy working at Safeway, sometimes you have to lift heavy items and that can put a strain on your body. Also standing for hours on end can be tough. Sometimes the best part about going to work is knowing that I get to talk to people all day, you eventually build a relationship with each customer and you feel like your part of their family."
good,"safeway taught me a lot being young but with new owner my managing skills were over looked because of my age and they wouldn't pay be more because of so and then at 8.25 ,would proceed to give my white coworker  10cent more because he counted money for the office but i was the one that ran the store when the store manager or co manager was gone this is for indiana"
good,"A lot of the employees at the Silverdale Safeway are friendly, management likes to put people with no experience into your department and have them as head sales when they don't want the position anymore, there's really no leadership right now in the bakery department. Also we have very few hard workers in that department and their hours are getting cut from 40 hours a week to 28 hours a week."
good,A typical day im pushing carts filling dairy facing shelves bagging. Management was good. Sometimes I felt like I should get paid a bit more. 10 would have been nice. considering I covered for people at the bakery side produce side.
good,"The Safeway I worked at was alright coworkers weren’t really nice and I wasn’t trained really, but other than that it was a good first job and I like interacting with people there."
good,I think the management could have been a little bit better and more relaxed but somewhat stressful in other words. As well with the stress having to know where everything is within a short period of time to further help with the customers wants and needs.
good,"I learn to enjoy to offer a great service to all customer and make a difference to provide some details in greetings , products, and  service. The company has a high rate customer service. In my opinion , the company offer training to the employees and incentives to the grown of the company in each month and the employees offer report to the company. "
good,Great place of work if your going to school it’s a good summer job to make some money during the summer to buy school stuff if you need it or anything
good,42 years at Safeway.. Had a Brain aneurysm and came back during the Sobey's buy out.. .. I felt we were disappointing our long term customers so I retired
good,Come to work on time do your job right and have good customer services. And always treat people with respect. The work is not hard so do a good job on it
good,I loved my time here the work is different everyday. And you get to know the regular customers . everybody helped each other .there was a true team effort to get the job done
good,"I loved working there, it was ideal for a summer time, relaxed environment and enjoyable people to work with. The employee discount was a big bonus and used frequently."
good,"Safeway is a fast-paced work environment driven on providing the best customer service. Being a barista, I learned a lot of multitasking and thinking on my feet. Management was very communicative and your expectations are clearly stated. It is a very straightforward job."
good,"My typical day as a front end supervisor consists of running a checkstand, ringing customers up. Handling customer complaints and giving customer service. I manage breaks and lunches through the day. There was lots of multitasking while assisting customers. I closed the store around 3 nights a week and it is easy work."
good,not very fun to work at but had nice coworkers . seemed like they had favorite employees . i learned that you might have to pick up other coworkers mess you have to be fast and organized
good,"I held various positions during my tenure at Safeway! I had eventual hopes in securing better compensation, but that become a moot point when I started to inquire."
good,"Prepared cakes and pastries, helped customers. Friendly environment. Room for creativity. Supportive coworkers. Always something to do. Not great pay."
good,"A typical day at work: checking, put frozen back to fridge,"
good,Going and gathering the carts from the parking lot to bring back to the entrance for customer use. Customer service by bagging groceries and helping them out to their cars.
good,Working in the Deli can be fun and tiresome. It keeps you busy for sure which I love. I love to keep busy at work. It also has its regular customers and you will meet all kinds of people.
good,I loved working this company. I learned alot from different meat cutter. The different kind of people you meet. And there benfits are not bad. The managment team help you out any way they can.
good,"A typical day at work would vary for me. During school I generally worked after school, working the 3:30PM-12:00AM shift. As for when Summer rolled around I would work until 8:00AM-3:00PM. I learned how to properly interact and assist customers. I also learned how to let those in charge of me what my schedule was and how to work out a working schedule for us both. The workplace culture was very relaxed, everyone knew what they had to do and just did it. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the bathrooms. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people, whom I got along very well with."
good,The Safeway I worked at had a clean work environment and that is what we were most known for as a store. The Deli department was good except for 5 Dollar Fridays and that paired with someone calling in sick did not make the work day flow well at all
good,day starts off with basic and general cleaning.Than once that was over I would start packing food items that would be put on the sales floor. The managers were some of the nicest and most humble people ive met.
good,I was a clerk. My day was running the paperwork  for the pickers and then getting independence ready for delivery. Running  tags for all product  answering phones. Tacking care of the office
good,"Was a fun place to work, just wish that they managed breaks better, fast pase work and friendly employees. Great customer service and well discounted products."
good,The job is good but the hardest part is that work is heavy. People are given an assignment  and you have to finish that assignment  within the time given or on time.
good,"safeway is a place that will accept you with open arms, its nice calm and relaxing. Working at safeway will give you the real world experience you need"
good,"Starting in Courtesy Clerk can trap you into a position. Good courtesy clerks rarely are given option to move up by upper management when Departments show interest. "
good,Nice employees and fun atmosphere. When i walk into most of my stores you always have people greeting you and saying good morning. The atmosphere is good.
good,"Great job to start off with, people are friendly and customers are great most of the time. They are a great company to work for just wish they had more opportunities for growth within their company.  They are great at giving their employees time off for school when needed or for personal reasons. Definitely a fast paced environment."
good,I was extremely fortunate to have a pharmacy manager that was very patient and willing to educate me in the daily operations of a retail pharmacy.  I enjoyed meeting new people through our customer base and always offered my assistance when possible/applicable.
good,only worked there for a few months pay was fair but they only had part time positions and the hours and day were random but i heard once full the benefits were nice
good,"Safeway is part of the second largest grocery chain in America, and you can tell because it's busy all the time, even when the store is fully staffed. They do their best to prepare you, and their extensive training program for new hires is one of the best in the industry."
good,Good company to work for as an intern. Good at teaching students/interns about what is expected of a retail pharmacist. Good work life balance and working environment.
good,Good employer who looked after staff well in terms of pay and benefits.  Well managed store and excellent staff.  Sadly went downhill when sold to morrisons and then subsequently coop
good,"Safeway consisted of bagging, go backs, and greeting customers. Fast paced but manageable. Management was easy going. Hardest part of the job was remembering where everything went. Enjoyable part of working at Safeway you meet new people everyday."
good,Not my favorite but it was an ok job. Felt like sometimes they didn't care but it was ok for a job. The people is awesome and they all keep it very professional
good,"Fun place to work at, employees are great, customers are great, pay isn't good. Good for kids in school, works with schedule well and are understanding of them."
good,This was my second job and it was a good experience there was always something to be done and I liked that. I will always remember what I learned at this job.
good,"The store I worked at was the busiest and highest volume store in the district. Because of this, the store was often busy most days of the week.  This could cause a stressful environment for some, because there were sometimes unrealistic demands from store management."
good,"Working for Safeway is all about customer service, The emphasis on this only increased over my time there. I found that most of the people I worked with truly enjoyed working there which made the job enjoyable for me. Most management teams were fair to all."
good,"I worked in the from line as store assistant manager."
good,"Before Albertson's came on board the company was an excellent place to work. I have since left the company but many changes have been made since they have taken over, some for the good, some for the bad."
good,"The job is a Union, with and without the union help, its a gamble your first 540 hours. You are required to pay the dues, but you are technically a part of the union but they dont do anything to provide job security until after the 540 hours due."
good,Good company to work with..had lots of company get togethers and softball games..the Christmas party was always a favorite.. would highly recommend this company
good,"Safeway is perfect for high school students and beginner college students. just gotta do your job and everything is fine. management is fair, salary is good, schedules are flexible. it was good."
good,"I worked in the gas bar, and it was an okay job. I left for it got a bit repetitious and I needed another experience. I worked with some great people, yet wanted more variety"
good,"Safeway was a high paced fun jobs. The people I worked with always was able to have a little bit of fun in the times that it was okay. The customer service was the Number 1 Priority. Safeway at times also was a little bit stressful, the amount of workers there were in the deli was not very sufficient which resulted in lack of customer service. There was not always enough workers due to low sales, but we also had low sales due to being understaffed. Safeway was really good at explaining and teaching you as you go along, although sometimes you may be stranded in left field depending on the amount of customers. Overall Safeway was a wonderful place to work at."
good,"It was my first job though i never got to presue my career there do to outside issues and would like to return someday. My coworkers where more than great, some very understanding of my situation. I wasnt mature enough for some things at the time but as a first job, thats expected."
good,"Everyone at Safeway is kind-hearted. There are no issues between co-workers, and everyone is just open-minded and sweet. I would highly recommend working here, it's a great environment. It is fast paced, and there's always something to do. The management is super friendly and understanding about everything. The responsibilities are intense, but it's nothing impossible. Keep up with your work and you'll have a blast, I promise. Everyone is always smiling and just down right nice."
good,"I love working at my safeway starbucks. I have a great team, amazing regulars. However there isn't in much way to advance or acquire more hours. Our team leader is new and she is doing well, but there is still room for improvment. Also safeway starbucks do not get the benefits a standard corporate starbucks recieves. So my options for furthering myself in starbucks careers is very limited."
good,The work I did was hard to do.I was always the closing clerk and had to empty the garbages and they were heavy.why do you care?Can you make my job easier?
good,"High Paced dealing with customers and people......Good company with quality employees and management.  Flexible hours, and consideration when life happens.  Sometimes the employees took advantage if you were a person that handled your position.  they would slack a little and expect you to do it for them.  This caused a little stress for everyone in the picture.  Management did their best to maintain the basic structure of management to bottom of the chain."
good,I worked at the fuel station. Fast pace at times but for the most part steady. The staff was great to work around. For the most part pretty flexible with my  schedule. It was a temporary position but enjoyed working there.
good,"At first it's a bad place to work at, but through the years they notice your work and offer raises."
good,"Typical work day includes busy independent work in my department. I've learned time management and interpersonal skill sets at this job more then ever that I will take with me. The overall management of the store is wonderful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers in bad moods, or when they get upset at things outside your own control (it just comes along with customer service). But the good outweigh the bad as the store is run quite smoothly and everyone does their part."
good,"Good place to work, wide range of jobs and cross training opportunities were available. Management expects the employees to be polite to customers and follow though with customer service."
good,"I got out of my junior year of high school and Safeway was the place to go. They were willing to hire a kid willing to do anything to get a job and prove themselves. The Tasks were nothing different then what you would do at home, so why not get paid to do what you already know how to do."
good,My one complaint about Safeway was regarding hours. Every cashier had to work some of the undesirable shifts regardless of any extenuating circumstances.  That requirement made working at Safeway difficult for me with a baby with health issues.
good,"Safeway is requires more and more reports and corporate statistics that ""must be"" submitted but they do not give the staff adequate labor coverage to accomplish this. They base labor on script count so if extra time is needed to serve a patient, scripts aren't being generated so ,in essence, the pharmacy loses."
good,"Develop working relationships with management, vendors and customers. I learned ICC, power equipment, store replenishment, supply replenishment, inventory process, stocking, cashiering and customer service."
good,"I would help to get fresh baked goods ready to deliver to a couple locations that didn't have in store bakeries. I would fry doughnut, package buns and muffins etc. and a little cake decorating."
good,This is a very stressful environment. I don’t recommend it to anyone who is looking for a career within this company due to management and sanitation issues.
good,"There are some pretty good benefits, good pay if you can move up, not a whole lot of opportunity for advancement past a certain point in some departments. Low starting wage for a large work load."
good,A typical day at work would generally consist of helping as many people as you can with whatever they need and making sure you are performing your duties to the best of your ability.  The management at the store where I worked were strict yet kind individuals that enforced accountability but weren't overbearing and rude.  Overall it's exactly what you'd expect from a company as large as Safeway is because it encourages individuality in dealing with customers yet you must adhere to their conduct policies.
good,Days at work tend to be slow but learning in the store is non stop. Many things do to and learn about. Management was not as strict as you would expect but very focused on getting things done at work. The hardest part of the job was not getting many days off or no days off. I enjoyed learning new things and doing higher level position work.
good,"Working at Safeway you see all sorts of things, many positive, some not so much. Customer service is a top priority, even when dealing with unruly customers. Good management, some good coworkers, an okay place to work overall."
good,"ok place to work, good pay, upper management difficult at times. pay is better the longer you work there.  you reach a peak of pay and position because of merger no way to go get training for store management position."
good,"Good place for my first job, everyone was helpful and friendly. Learned a lot about produce, from, up keeping, packaging, and culling. Good job overall."
good,"I started off as a courtesy clerk and two years later I did not expect my self to still work here. I am now a food clerk and a part time PIC (person in charge, $21/hr). For this reason that I am now getting a shot at the person in charge position is why I am still at Safeway, me being 20 years old this is the best pay I could receive as of now and that's why my Safeway time has been decent. I feel that the experience of working at Safeway relies heavily on the type of manager that you have and the work culture that surrounds you created by co workers and customers."
good,The Manager was really a good guy because show me bagging this is right or wrong sometimes. got days off from getting sick the Benefits were great if get hurt fall my injuries pay for their insurance companies make sure you 're okay cause was unity jobs.
good,I enjoyed the comradery between the employees and the supervisors. I loved this one supervisor who was always willing to work with the other staff and help out just like we were. She was very nice to all the customers and lead by example.
good,Great team oriented environment where working together is rewarding. Often shown appreciation for a job well done. Room for advancement but you may have to compromise your morals to move to the top.
good,"A typical day at work for safeway includes clocking in and going to your station to begin work. Greeting customers in a friendly manner, scanning products, bagging groceries. Handling cash/credit, coupons, and wic/foodstamps. Taking care of customer complaints. At times working along side management."
good,"The hardest part and the most enjoyable part of the job, or any retail job, is the people. Customers and coworkers are what make or break a job culture."
good,"the work was great learn a lot in the deli department, making sandwich is a fast past and can be frustrating because customer desire, morning prep was good and evening closing demanding."
good,"Working for Safeway was educational and taught me how to use a register. Though at the time the store was understaffed, the hours were decent per person but you ended up having longer lines. Overall a good place to work if you're needing a job."
good,"Easy to learn, nice people to work with. they were able to work with my scheduel. Great managers, and nice customers. working there was a pleasure...."
good,A busy working environment. I learned how to operate a till and ensure cash taken matched correctly to till roll at end of shift. Management were approachable and the workplace culture was customer focused. The hardest part of the job was stock replenishment which could involve movement of large quantities of items on occasion. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting members of the public.
good,"Great company, management and customer's! Its a great company to advance fast within, there's always ways to advance to upper management. My overall experience at Safeway was Amazing!"
good,"I learnt many things and had great experience working for the company. I learnt a lot about myself and my skills and ability, such a shame the company has closed down."
good,"a typical day at work for me consists of rotating and stocking milk, eggs, and perishable dairy products, temping coolers, and writing safety observations. I've learned the importance of date checking items as well as rotating them and what items sell in what quantities when. I feel as though managers are managers and just that, never being personable with their employees and breathing down your neck more often than not. In the workplace you're always dealing with people, greeting them with smiles and asking if you can help them with anything, you always have to provide 1st class customer service. The hardest part of the job is being expected to get EVERYTHING done without help in a department that needs 2 people to work it. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is working around the other employees in the store."
good,It's a good starter job if your interested to join after high school there's alot of cleaning as a courtesy like cleaning floors pushing in carts in the parking lot helping up front ect
good,Come in and make sure my bags and register was accurate. After I went from a bagger to cashier. I would converse and make sure the groceries they wanted are scanned and placed properly in the bag. I would make sure I went fast and remembered all the numbers for veggies etc.
good,This was a fun job to work at. Flexible hours and there is a lot of room for advancement. Management was always respectful. The only hard part was working during the summer when it was really hot.
good,"My 2 years there were generally enjoyable. Hours were okay, people friendly; relatively easy job. As a courtesy clerk there's a lot to clean up usually. So just prepare to be needed."
good,"Very fast paced job, never a real moment of down time. Great for multi-tasker types of people, good for those who like to meet a variety of customers."
good,It was a good job it is just that i did or could not make as much as i  wanted.it always felt like there was never enough time to complete your tasks.
good,Great place to work if you enjoy a fast paced work environment. Expect to be held accountable for not getting everything done that you are supposed to in a day.
good,My typical day at work i keep my area clean I come in on time and get my work done time goes by fast customers are friendly the people i work with are friendly
good,This is a great company to work for. A typical day would be bagging groceries and going outside to push carts. I learned a lot of patience while I worked at Safeway. The workplace culture is great. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with the heat in the summer time. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers and having conversations with other employee's when your not busy.
good,"You're able to set your own hours and request days off 2 weeks in advance, so makes for nice work/ life balance. PIC or lead may change schedule any time after schedule is posted, so be aware to check it frequently. You may get called in at a few hours notice or can decide to swap hours with another employee if approved by manager with advance notice."
good,"Staff and management is amazing to work with. If you are willing to stand for a long period of time and have the patience to deal with extremely rude customers, you will be fine."
good,"When I would come in, most employees and customers would be friendly to me and I would be friendly back and I learned a lot about working with people."
good,"On a typical day at work, I would help with the cutting and grinding of meat products for customer purchase. I learned a lot about the anatomy of cattle, pig, and chicken I never knew before. I learned about a variety of cuts of meat and how best to prepare them. My experience with my manager was great, but the higher up the chain of command, the pressure was brought down on us to get more sales. I enjoyed my coworkers a lot and the health benefits were great."
good,It was a great first job. Started when I was 16. It was easy to learn each department. I made many friends there. And I also learned a lot on what to look for in my future job from there
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, the hours are not steady and fluctuate often. Very hard to get full time there. The job is fast paced, and you stay busy most of the time."
good,The work experience was fun but some of the employees weren't on point and kept up with their job productions witch made working there kinda bad cause there were problems left and right
good,Great place to work. The people are great. Management is great. Works well with my at home restraints. Wish they had given me the 40 hours i needed. I would have stayed.
good,"My job experience working at Safeway as a Courtesy Clerk was very helpful and I formed a lot of essential skills.  I swiftly picked up useful janitor jobs that I wasn't familiar with before, costumer service skills, bagged groceries and stocked shelves.  Every Lesson I learned at work was very beneficial."
good,"i would pick orders from a forklift, paper, water and numerous other products. quiet place to work and great pay. the hardest part of that job if i had to say would have been the hours i would have to work."
good,"I liked Safeway . For a temp job that turned into a 23year job .It paid my bills and the medical /dental really came in handy . Like any job ,it is what you put in to it is what you are going to get out of it ."
good,Its a nice place to work. Employees and guests are nice. Nice location. Nice pay. Easy work............ The managers try to work with you on scheduling.
good,Small six store grocery store located in Indianapolis Indiana that was really fun to work for. The customers were great and I learned quite a bit there.
good,"Safeway was a very fun and interesting learning experience. I mainly liked the job, because it was my first introduction into the job world. I would work there again if they offered me more payment."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Safeway when I was working in the Floral dept. or in File Maintenance, but not as a cashier. Management was very kind and understanding to their employees."
good,I loved my time at this plant. There was lots of opportunities to advance my career and people who took interest in me moving up. I learned so much and feel that upper management was more of a mentor to me. I liked the staff and felt that we were almost family. I am sad that this facility closed.
good,Working with my crew was fun and challenging.  Learning something new everyday.  The hours were long but the day fly by because of the  fun atmosphere.  The lead man and carpenter always  willing to teach me to ropes to the craft.
good,"I worked at Safeway for two years, safeway is an overall good company. Although the management at my former store was never stable (always someone leaving and getting a new manager) and there isn't a lot of room for advancement."
good,"Working closely with team members, we tried to provide customer service at the highest level while working quickly and efficiently."
good,"Every other day, there is always something to do. No matter how slow it gets at the store. Pushing in carts, changing the Trash, cleaning the Front End, and such. Sweep log, which is where you walk around the store, and check off a list of what is cleaned and what needs attention. "
good,"This was my first job and it was great, it was always busy which made the shifts go by quick. You get to connect with customers and there's many employees to help you get through the day."
good,A typical day at work would be getting there 15 minutes early to change into my uniform and then going to clock in. I would ask where they would need me right away and then continue to do what they asked. After that i would spend my shift in a till helping customers. At the end of the day i would sign out and say goodbye to my co-workers while proceeding to get unchanged and go home.
good,"A typical day normally consisted of stocking shelves, bagging, and bringing in carts. I learned that to survive in retail you have to become friends with your coworkers because the job can be rough at times. Management was good for the most part, there was one very hardcore manager though. Co-workers were nice and friendly. Hardest part was how time seemed to stall at times. Most enjoyable was getting to know my co-workers."
good,"Safeway taught me a lot about production, packaging, ordering, and I  even gained more customer service skills. I got along with all my co-workers; even when we were under a lot of stress."
good,"To print any and all reports for day to day operations. Check meat counter for quality control. Cut meat needed for counter for daily sales while remaining high customer service."
good,"This position was a wonderful learning experience, I look forward to becoming a partner. Co-workerks and management is wonderful. Pay is great and the customers are the best part!"
good,I have learned a lot from this position. My time management skills have improved and I am hoping to grow in this position and with this company. I have grown a great deal as an employee.
good,A very busy pace... great group of people to work with. Lots of learning opportunities. With an excellent safety culture.
good,"Managers and employees were really fun part there because of their nature and after couple months i started, everyone started to know more about me and same applies for me. i still have really good relations with all managers at safeway"
good,"Worked in the back of the bakery doing set up for the next day as well as frying the doughnuts for the day."
good,Safeway is family friendly and a safe place.  It's also customer friendly and very professional. Co workers are respectful towards eachother.
good,Was a great place to begin in looking how to deal in customer service. This job taught me a lot. Overall a very good job. I would recommend working for Safeway.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of prepping the meat, packaging the meat, and putting the product on the shelves for consumption. Pulling all the expired product off the shelf. Ringing up customers at the counter."
good,"As a courtesy clerk, your duty is to assist customers and staff. You bag groceries and ask if assistance is needed to load bags into car. You gather loose carts and place them in cart stations. You sweep the floor of dirt and check prices when necessary. Management is helpful when you need their help and co-workers are good people."
good,"My first 7 months there, I had THE BEST managers. Very supportive. Work was work.. but work was also fun. I had the best co-workers. I really appreciate that Safeway didn't discriminate against people with disabilities. I met so many hard working people. I LEARNED SO MUCH!"
good,The typical day consisted of loading and unloading crates of all sorts of items and restocking shelves. The days were fairly easy but sometimes things get hectic and you might have to step to do someones job.
good,"My experience working at Safeway was overall positive. The atmosphere was encouraging and stimulated good work. Whilst I worked as a meat clerk, I enjoyed helping customers and completing my tasks. After I was promoted to seafood manager, the extra responsibility was no problem for me to handle. I did in fact feel under trained to some degree, i found there were some tasks i did not yet know how to do. The hardest part of the job would have been taking inventory. The organization of the back room was poor when i started and was hard to improve. The most enjoyable was helping customers and learning knew aspects of my work."
good,"Responsible for managing department inventory, in-stock position, pricing integrity, merchandising, labor, "
good,"Its ok place to start in the work world, its not bad theyre will to work with any schedule you give them. so there a good company , managers are also good to the employees."
good,"It was a great first job learning experience for me, ad I'm excited to move forward with another job opportunity. I would recommend this job to anyone who is looking for their first job and need experience."

The managers are easy going yet business oriented. The coworkers are also interesting and varied. The hardest part of the job is to please everyone while the most gratifying part of the job is the co workers."

I see it as if I am able to help one person out it still made a difference showing that we do care and that   even if they have a bad day that some how I was able to make it better to have them be able to get in and out the fast they can. Working with co-works that did take there job really seriously but over all I would still have co-workers that I would work with that would have fun with while doing the job to were it made the day go by faster.

good,"I liked working with the customers in Safeway, including giving them help to their cars carrying the bags or pushing the cart with the bags then put them in the car."
good,"A typical day at work started off clocking in to work and greeting everyone up front on the registers. I would then go to my department which was mainly produce and start breaking down the load and pushing out products. Every so often I would be asked a question by a customer and do my best to help them solve the problem they encountered. Before leaving I would cull through the whole department and say my goodbyes to all my coworker, which I had a great relationship with. Management was great always trying to help and adjusting schedules accordingly to every coworker. To me the hardest part of my job was just the labor side of it like carrying heavy boxes, which was not hard at all. I enjoyed the interaction with coworkers and customers everyday and that was the most enjoyable part of the job. I learned how to show excellent customer service."
good,A day at work is busy because it's a grocery store. There'sa lot of work to attend to which keeps you busy. The managament has good rapport with employees and the job keeps a person active and fit.

good,Was able to travel and train others in new software that I assisted in developing. We had good cost savings measures in place.

good,stocking shelves and help to check costumers out at the cash register help costumers with any other needs. My most enjoyable part about working Vons is always meeting new people. The hardest part of working at Vons is making costumers to management and  everyone satisfied only have some must time in a day. I've learn to be a wiser stronger individual through life experiences at Vons.
good,I learned how to wrap and package meat for display. I learned customer service along with how to receive the product from various vendors that we used.
good,"Well, I was a pharmacy tech for 8 7 1/2 years at safeway. A typical day at the store was entry level at computer, answering phones, customer service, cahier, insurance claims, etc...Loved working with others. The best part of my job was interacting with the customers."
good,Safeway Corporation Call Center was a great call center to work at.  The training was comprehensive and the supervisors work with their employees to make sure they are making their goals.  The only factor that was a concern was that Safeway was recently purchased by Albertson's Inc so there were many layoffs as management was adjusting to the merger.
good,a typical work day here for me would be to make sure everything is set up and ready to go to start the shift. I learned to communicate with others well and how to use my energy and positive and smile to my advantage. my coworkers were amazing and easy to get along with. the hardest part of my job was collecting carts in the hot summer sun of phoenix.
good,"work on the registers"
good,"I've learned that how enjoyable your job is really depends on the management and store vibe.  I'm on a traveling team.  I know which stores are fun places to work, and which to avoid like the plague.

good,"Everyday, I helped many customers with their shopping needs. Some customers were angry at purchases and others were happy. Those that were angry received all my attention and I solved their issues. If I wasn't able to resolve the matter, I would direct them to the person that would. I strived to complete their transactions such as wire transfers, movie rentals and grocery shopping efficiently so that they may continue with their daily lives."
good,loved working here. willing to work with your availability. great mangement. friendly associates. mangement was always willing to help out with cashiering when we got busy.
good,"My typical day would start out seeing if I needed to relieve anyone for their break. I was either at a cah register or at working the customer service desk. At the end of my shift I counted the revenue and documented it."
good,"A typical day is usually made by yourself , I had a set routine and spaced my jobs out to fill the whole day up. Sometimes you would have extra jobs to do for the offers on sale such as displays and promos. I got on with all my work colleagues and when you work in supermarket you are one big team so you help each other. I didn't find this job hard in anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed working at Safeway."
good,"I truely liked this job as it was a very fun fast paced environment. I got to manage my employees, be in charge of ordering products, scheduling, having to deal with customers, be role a model, provide excellent customer service."
good,"Had an opportunity to be mentored by others in my field."
good,"Everything is about customer service; both customers and employees.  A good company to work for with great support from supervisors and management.  I developed skills and knowledge in Cal-OSHA regulations along with environmental affairs with CUPA, EPA and county inspectors.  The hardest part of my job was ensuring that all employees, including management, executed both company policies and state laws/regulations."
good,"I started working at Safeway, "
good,"-Help customers with what they need"
good,"I learn a interesting new job in working doing show cases,learning new food and preparing great tasting food. I enjoyed working with co~workers and my bosses.the hardest part of this job was that going in i knew nothing,but i learned a lot and i like what i did."
good,"Vons (or Safeway) is a place where you can feel a part of a team, be a leader, be a follower and be apart of a family. The people there are nice, very easy to work with and the only overwhelming part is when a sporting event hits and people want to get their drinks and snacks before the event. The breaks are fair, employment is fair and training is thorough."
good,I enjoyed solving problems that arose and designing signs to promote deals. I didn't like that sometimes it seemed like thinking outside the box was discouraged.
good,"Safeway was my first job and in the beginning. I thought it was a very nice environment working with customers at the best of my ability. I learned a lot of new things and worked in different departments in the grocery store. The things that I learned at Safeway, helped me for jobs in the future. When I would go in for my shift, the day would go by so fast because of how hard I was working. The managers were real lenient  with the employees making sure everything was getting done. The thing I liked most about working at Safeway was helping customers, working hard and making different foods."
good,Its a good place to work. They are getting bought out so i feel its time to move on with a uncertain future. i need job security
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to create product in an ongoing basis; being able to see the end result of all my team's hard work is one of my most rewarding employment benefits.  In addition to creating beautiful product, I am able to build substantial relationships with my team and my customers.  Without the ongoing support of my customers I would not have a job; as a valuable employee I recognize this and go out of my way to ensure that quality personal relationships are built with the people that we serve."
good,"Serving customers in a friendly manner. I also did the hiring for the store, was also a mentor to new employees."
good,"Safeway is a good company to start out with. They are equal-opportunity employers, and know how to give customers the best possible products with the best possible service. I learned excellent customer service skills during my time with Safeway, and value my experience as a part of their team."
good,"worked there for 37 years. learned justs about every aspect of store operations, from daily to weeky projections, pricing structures, audits."
good,"I management well, I have to trained new workers and open/close the doors. My typical day at work, is the focus of work, I clock in, I did what they asked me which was, putting item back on the self, if a person ask where ""cheese was?"" I would say ""In the dairy self."" Other jobs were including going outside, getting carts from their racks and do it quickly as possible. The hardest part was, training new worker because I'm not very social person, so the term of talking, I had trouble but I like working as a team when I needed to. My co-worker, always knew I would help or I would say ""I will be back, I just need to do this first."" The most enjoyed part was closing, because I had time to put stuff away, clean the check-out stands, the night were cooler, and seeing night owls."
good,"A typical day at work began with immediately jumping onto a register to start checking customers out. I learned: how to operate the register system, I memorized a lot of different produce codes, how to diffuse high-stress customer/employee situations, the layout of the store, the proper way to bag groceries, etc. I really enjoyed working with all my managers, they were helpful and looking out for my best interests. All of my coworkers were a joy to work with and helped out tremendously in difficult situations.

good,"Overnight Freight:  Bring pallets out from back.  Move caselots to proper aisle.  Open boxes, shelve product, straighten shelves. Backstock. Dispose of cardboard.  Cashier as-needed, this Safeway was open 24/7.  "
good,This company was a good place for someone to start off in. The reason I left was because of a consistently conflicting schedule with my school.
good,"I enjoy this job."
good,"Job is difficult with time restrictions on everything that you do..Employees are given a time standard for their job and are required to maintain that standard. The standard is constantly being revised to achieve as much work as possible out of each employee.Yiu don't get to know your fellow employees anymore because everyone has to wear a headset with their orders being sent to them. You are more like a number than a person.Breaks are 15 minutes, but several employees have to work part of that to achieve their standard"
good,"Working for Safeway was an experience. You were never in the same location day to day. The co-workers were easy to get along with, just a good place to be employed."

good,"Cleaning, bagging of groceries, cleaning of facilities. Customer service including carrying groceries to vehicle."
good,"I started out in the pharmacy at Safeway and after a few months was offered a job as the closing supervisor of the whole store.  6 years later I became the bookkeeper and Customer service manager, and the hiring coordinator. I was in charge of oredering, as well as all of the hiring for the store."
good,"Baking/Decorating for Vons was an overall positive experience, my coworkers were a pleasure to work with and there was ALWAYS something to do, shifts went by like lightning. The best part was that  my hours were always steady, which is hard to come by these days."

good,"A typical day at work would be different everyday, although your duties are normally the same, sometimes you do not know what kind of issues you need to deal with. In the four years working at Safeway I learned many helpful skills to reach customer satisfaction.

good,"I had learned how to bag groceries, sweeping and mopping a big store."
good,"I worked here while attending community college. Safeway allowed me to have a flexible scheduled while in school. I worked as a cashier here and my favorite part of the job was the constant one on one interaction I would have with customers. I ended up having many ""regulars"" there and miss that type of daily interaction with them. The only thing that was difficult about this job was staying in one spot the entire day. Fortunately, I was always busy so shifts went by fast!"
good,This position was my most challenging stepping into management after six months of working as a cashier.  I had to learn policy and procedure while on the job and from my co-workers which endeared me to some and not the rest.  Setting schedules and doing payroll was probably the easiest to learn since they had solid instructions in place.  I did have many training courses later on that validated everything I had learned on the job and from my managers.
good,Checking that my work area was clean and belt working for customers shopping making sure stocked with enough bags there wasn't a bad thing I can say about any aspect of the job it was a fun environment and the customers were also a pleasure to serve and help if help was needed

I ewnjoyed the management I had worked with at the company but at times it was difficult.  I think ,my coworkers are fun to work with and help each other  and enjoy work . the hardest part for me is being in the rain and doing carts. the costumers make me happy"

good,i loved working at safeway cause of the regular customers and friendly staff...i loved my job
good,Was constantly busy. Fun people to work with.  Great management friendly and treated employees with respect. Hour's were a little difficult at times. As long as you were available any time you got the hours.
good,"A typical day at work, the customers were my boss. I didnt deal with my lead too much I interacted alot with the fans. It was an independent lifestyle."
good,I loved coming to work at vons because the customer made it easy to serve them. I saw how the managers were so geniune in helping the customers an also teaching you along the way so u could be prepared to be a manager or to a department that pays alot more an requires more people skills and better decision making. The hard part was going outside during the summer to get the shopping carts because it was to hot. 
good,"Safeway is a good job where the people you work with are easy to get along with, and management is good about getting things done that need to get done."
good,"learned how to work quickly and efficiently"
good,"I started as a bagger when I was 16, and quickly moved up the chain as my skills improved. I had a natural talent when it came to customers, and Safeway taught me the importance of customer loyalty. I have only been held in the highest regard when it came to my work, and the management have often complimented my ethics. I ran several departments, and quickly learned how to work efficiently when hours were cut. I got promoted to receiver, and became a key person to the stores success. My tasks were many, and the longer I was there, the more I took on. My main goal was shrink prevention, and I had an average percentage of .52%."
good,"I was a front end cashier, also a part time shelf stocker. I assisted customers with paying for and packing their groceries and also with putting stock on shelves"
good,Everyday started with prepping in the morning by facing up the department and filling milk and eggs. I learned faster ways of stocking product by hands on and being familiar with the product. The face down was not necessary the hardest part of the job but time consuming. I enjoyed everyday working with the customers and help them with their grocery needs.
good,"Easy tasks, hours are not inconvenient, room for promotions, and overall good place to work."
good,I am trained in most aspects and daily functions in the store. I have also trained multiple employees within the store. I carry great leadership and communication skills.
good,If you work hard you can easily advance and make a career out of it. The pay is horrible and controlled by the union.

good,just it closed down i probally still be there the money was decent and people were nice
good,Good place to start a career in management. They taught me great customer service skills. Showed me how to deal with everyday issues as well as problem solving skills.

good,The management has been extremely helpful and accommodating with my schedule.
good,"Not and overall bad place to work. The management was kind to everyone and listened to what we had to say. There were some not so kind characters but that's to be expected anywhere. Some supervisors were not well trained and did not listen to more than one side of any story. All in all, it was a job with some fun people and some not so fun people. If our supervisor was convincing enough we put forth more effort and did a great job and went home"
good,Great place to work. Everyone was friendly and all tight-knit. I was welcomed with open arms
good,I love the interaction with the customers. I have bonded with quite a few of them. I look forward to seeing them and catching up with what has been happening in their lives. I enjoy multi-tasking and having the opportunity to work with others daily as a team.
good,"While at Safeway I was able to learn the Deli, Starbucks and the fuel station. While there I was able to learn most aspects of the Departments. I was working alot with in the Deli where I Would make the trays when they were ordered. Some time when working with people there are those who are having a rough time and they take it out on the person who is behind the counter. I was able to learn how to just smile and help them not matter what was being said to me. Since I was there for 5 years it was sad when a couple of people that I got to know a some people on a First Name basis and when they passed away it was very sad."
good,"Great co-workers and management for the most part when I was there; since it is a grocery store and retail, you are pretty busy which helped with long hour shifts; just like everywhere, had to deal with those select few bad customers, but overall a great experience"

good,Safewy was good to me...Decent pay and benefits...I liked my hours usually and had regular days off...I worked with some great people and learned a lot...I liked the physical labor it was like a free gym...and I had a 7 minute commute...The hardest part of the job was getting a load out in the time that they gave me..especially if they sent an inexperienced person to help me...but I always appreciated any help...The Truckee store is so busy and we were always busting to keep it looking good...
good,"This position required working from locations in Norristown, Pa and Lanham, MD. My typical week including meetings at the Safeway Eastern Division office in Lanham, MD and visiting stores with retail team who are my direct reports. Providing support to stores teams was the most enjoyable part of my job as they are on the front line serving the customers. The CB team are the ""Ambassadors"" of the Store Brand Programs and responsible to provide sales information and opportunites."
good,"I have stayed at my job for so long because the people I work with are so much fun to be around, and we all work together as a team.

Ultimately, I thoroughly enjoy where I work."
good,•Acknowledge customers in Deli Department and always greet them with a smile.
good,"I worked graveyard which was fine so my typical night at work would have been arriving at 10:30p and clocking in on a time clock. A typical night would be to move pallets of groceries to the floor and work from aisle one down until done with an hour off for lunch. Oh, our small night staff was responsible for the customers too. I would often rotate and work out of the filing office. On those nights I would print tags to price the supermarket and check inventory. Management at Safeway was superb. The night shift was highly praised by the primary store manager and the workers all seemed to get a long real well. The hardest part of the job was the unusual switches in days off and having to become nocturnal. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with my co-workers and the random customers in our quite busy 24/7 supermarket."
good,"Varying hours and serving the public. Management was professional and made sure the job got done. Working with people was the most enjoyable part, co-workers were also very helpful and teamwork was a large part of the culture."
good,"Great staff, met lots of nice clients, learned how to train new employees, customer service, inventory control."
good,"I learned Retail Leadership and Developement and Zinger Miller Business Management to effectively lead large groups of employees to be the best they could be at Superior Customer Service. I learned Management skills, Departmental skills, Inventory Control skills, and a variety of other skill while working for Safeway"
good,"I learned interacting with people of different cultures. I learned about different kinds of hams, meat and cheese and how to use, disassemble and sanitize a heavy duty slicing machine. The hardest part of the job is when you do the night closing on Saturday where you have to clean everything including the counters, but it is challenging and fun."
good,"There were over a hundred customers a day, and I got to know most of them by name. I valued my customers as friends."
good,"fun place to work at, flexible schedule, chance for advancement"
good,"I started in the store level checking groceries. As dept. mgr. order and inventory product. As assistant buyer, handle invoices from companies and asst. the buyer with shipping."
good,"A very challenging job, ensuring that customers are satisfied starting from greeting them; the stocks at the store are well stacked and well arranged."
good,Very good company to work for its usually the management that you have to worry about.
good,Safeway is a very busy retail grocery chain that is very customer service orientated. Having a very strong work ethic this job was very enjoyable.
good,I like Safeway as a company but miss the self expression as a chef and the variety. Production work can be interesting and I have enjoyed the opportunity to experience another aspect of baking as a career. The hardest part of the job has been working nights. I don't get to interact with any co-workers as my shift is generally a solo duty and seldom are there others around. Our bakery manager does a great job in writing the schedule to suit everyones individual needs and also has to deal with hours based on sales for her scheduling and is able to meet the challenge on a weekly basis.
good,This is a somewhat fast-paced environment to work in but the work load is never overwhelming.
good,"This is a good company to join, if you like working with customers, and for a union. The pay raises and benefits are decent, and there's always a manager around in case of any questions or inquiries."
good,I enjoyed working for Safeway because if they saw you working hard they would reward you. Also they had no problems with moving people up to better positions if you earned it.
good,I would see new and different people each day and find new cultures and different life styles. Met many people and had a fun time working with them.
good,Fast paced and lots to do. U never get bored. People are great and fun to work with. Friendly enviroment
good,Safeway is a great company to work for. The company exemplifies diversity.
good,"One of the best things about working at Safeway, was that, though you did need to meet certain expectations, the management, as well as coworkers, were very good at forgiving and correcting mistakes. Friends were easily made with the management and other workers, and the team spirit made it a fun job. One of the hardest parts of the job was during the holidays; at about a week before any holiday, the business doubled, sometimes tripled. Getting more work done with the same amount of time was definitely a challenge, but helped me work at a faster pace."
good,I received merchandise as it came in every night.  Restocked shelves in the aisles. Assist cashiers with products and Bagging when short staffed. The hardest part of the job  to me was not being able to finish up all the work in such short time spann
good,i enjoyed this job it had a higher pay than most because of the location it stayed very busy and i enjoyed that i enjoy working with other people in the work
good,"If you are planning on applying you should avoid the Bakery at all cost, the work day starts absurdly early (3am) and ends  around 1-2pm however the amount of work you do is quite a lot especially if you have little help. It's very enjoyable if you and your coworker get along but it pretty tedious alone."
good,Loyal to there employees. They promoted within the house. Management always help out when busy. Always family orientated.. always receive praise when doing a good job.
good,I liked working there but it wasn't the right fit for me. The people are really nice. Most of the customers are also. I had a lot of friends there. Being apart of the union was weird at first but it was kinda nice.
good,"It was good, managers helped me out with a flexible schedule and the people’s union was a great benefit to have and take advantage of. I enjoyed going to work."
good,"Good store level management. Friendly co-workers. Is union, for all the good and bad that includes. Feels like a work family. But starting to feel a little corporate."
good,It's a pretty good place to work. The customer base is a good one. I feel I help people every day and that makes me feel good about the work I do. I often make someone's day.
good,"I think I spoke about my work with Safeway Foos in Tracy California. I enjoyed the job just me and my family decided that we was going to relocate and move back to the South. If there are more questions that a company would like to ask me.  I would be happy to answer any questions, thank you for this opportunity"
good,I would give Safeway an amazing review because there wasn't really anything bad about the company. The only bad thing would be the pay per hour. Other then the pay I loved working here and miss it.
good,it is a good place to work with good people. work a lot of hours but enjoy the environment. I enjoy the atmosphere as well. it really has all amenities as well
good,"Responsibilities included bagging, go backs, cleaning out the car corrals, cleaning the bathrooms, cleaning the front end, and other general front end assistance - including helping customers with what they might need."
good,I worked at Safeway Canada part-time for more than a year.  Good people and good relaxed atmosphere.  Opportunity for advancement for people interested to grow.
good,"Greeted all customers and provided them with prompt and courteous assistance"
good,You need to have a good memory because you have to memorize all the codes. Have to be good with people and good at solving problems. You need to be a team player as well as work independently
good,"Each day was the exact same. Open up boxes of food, and fill the aisles with whatever was in the box. Management was good. They spoke to their employees like regular people. It was an informal boss-employee dynamic."
good,Didn’t get trained very well so was unaware of what to do most of the time. People were great tho! Hours were awesome and getting paid weekly was always a plus!
good,"Good company, I always got the hours & schedule I wanted. Good & fast environment. Very easy & fast Company if you want to move up. Only bad thing open on all holidays."
good,"it was a pleasure working at Safeway, the people were helpful and always willing to assist and answer questions. It was only a few minutes from my home and I enjoyed that."
good,"workplace was great friendly people was able to be provided with heaps of training with staff and management.Delivery drivers will carry the order inside and place it wherever you'd like it. If drivers are going to be late, they call ahead. Usually that delay is only 10-15 minutes past the delivery window. Safeway is generous with emailing good coupons for discounted or free delivery codes."
good,"I was constantly on my toes.   On busy days, which was pretty much everyday customers traveling on cruises would come in and order a variety of meals and dishes."
good,"Although much of the work at Safeway pharmacy was repetitive, every day brought new challenges and expanding expectations. The workplace culture was challenging. The management culture was kind yet very confrontational. The most enjoyable part of working at Safeway was the opportunity to grow into more responsibility and self governing roles so long as I put the effort and time into the work and tasks at hand."
good,"it was good i had fun but was to busy with school so i couldn't keep u p with the hours, i would work there again now that i  have finsied school but need a position to open up again."
good,I like people and I try to chat with them and welcome them and give them a smile =)   My co-workers are fun to work with we all try to keep a positive attitude towards our day or night !
good,Great environment great people and best chance of climbing the corporate ladder. Training was finominal and the management was very enthused to help at every turn.
good,It was a good place to work for a student who was looking to gain good work experience. It was a fun place to work every Tuesday from October to June of 2019
good,"I was fortunate to work inventory which was considered entry level management. "
good,The place was very fast paced but sometimes too much. They would make courtesy clerks go out to push carts for an hour at 100+ degree weathers and makes them go in the low degrees while it’s raining and isn’t fair at all.
good,"As a overnight clerk who has also worked days, I will say that if you can handle a decent amount of work daily and be resilient. you can make it here."
good,It was a positive job experience just looking for something to further my career. I helped greet customers and ring up their groceries and answer their questions.
good,"Dont apply if you have in life obtained a criminal record they wont hire you and if by chance you do get hired an they find that you do have a criminal record they will fire you."
good,Safeway is a good starting job and for the few that can handle management have a great opportunity for advancement. I would recommend this job to anyone young or otherwise.
good,It's an easy job for decent pay. Good health insurance opportunities. They give good training the hours are pretty inconsistent though which can be rough.
good,Excellent place of employment for full students. Also a great 2nd job for part time work. Safeway is very flexible and will work around your schedule and availability.
good,fast paced work enviroment very friendly co workers and management . management was very understanding if you needed to switch a shift with someone. Every day was an adventure
good,"I started as a courtesy clerk then about two weeks later they promoted me up to the customer service desk, then to day stocking, then around a month I was learning how to run the store help the managers out when needed"
good,Not a bad job I like it. The interview I believe took like 30 minutes. They were really nice and helpful with any questions I had about the store. I appreciate that.
good,I worked as a courtesy clerk so for me it was very slow paced. I enjoyed the work because your crew is always so nice and helpful but your work was limited to your job position.
good,"Great place to work, good people, teamwork is encouraged. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement. I started as an Administrative Assistant and advanced to a Promotional Specialist."
good,I enjoyed working for Safeway. I left because I found a full time 9-5 Mon - Thursday job. The management and staff were excellent. The pay and benefits were fair. based on experience.
good,Duties ranged from cleaning to assisting customers and handling transactions. management was fair and coworkers are respectful. The hardest part would be balancing production and customers as it did get busy.
good,Things constantly change there. It's not bad if you plan on a short term employment. I do not think it is the best place to be for a long time career.
good,I really liked working at Safeway. I started out as cashier and then I would help out with Customer Service behind the desk. I had to call people in if someone could not come in. I helped customers with their returns and any other needs they may have. At the end of the day I had to count the money and put in the safe.Management was great! They were very helpful and fun to be with. I liked working with my teammates. The best part of the job was enjoying my co-workers and meeting so many people!
good,"A multi-billion dollar company in the food/grocery business. Over 150 stores nationwide. The warehouse employees are LOCAL UNION 104, a difficult, inept and selfish organization."
good,It’s ok.  The store manager is great with people.  She does a lot for her customers. She hires special needs people and that is an amazing heart.    The people are great and they are very helpful
good,"My experience with working at Safeway was great. Everyone was very friendly and Safeway provided a very comfortable workplace. It seemed like everyday I was learning something new.The management team was very nice and was always there to answer any questions I had. I learned how to address many different problems and assist many different customers. The hardest part about the job was trying to assist customers with information I didn't have. thanks to my co workers and management team, I was able to assist anyone. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with a lot of my co workers."
good,"Working at safeway is harder now then it used to be. Benefits used to be better and the moral used to be way better. Since Albertsons took over Safeway has gone a little downhill since then, If you find a great manager make sure you stick with them."
good,Working with safeway over the past 9 years has been a great experience. I was able to expand my work experience ten fold. My only complaint would be that I am unable to transfer to another store and keep my full time.
good,"I like the place..... Really do, There is one ""A......(customer)""; once in a while, but overall people are nice, and coworkers are too."
good,"The average day of working in the Meat Department was helping customers. cleaning, prepping the food and case to be presentable to the public. And following safety and sanitation guidelines while doing so."
good,"Helpful management and friendly staff. The manager was always accommodating with adjusting my hours when I needed to."
good,"Depending on the managers and how the store is run it can be a lot of fun , so i recommend go in with an open mind so that you can enjoy your time there ."
good,"Other than the fact it is a mandatory union job (which is illegal to fire someone for in the state of MT), it was a great job. The manager and other people were nice, and the hours were very flexible with school."
good,"Safeway is a stable work environment that treats employees fairly. While I worked here, I received a 10% discount on all final purchases and felt comfortable with my coworkers."
good,"customer service based."
good,"The Safeway in my town was near a university, so a lot of students worked there, including me. They were very flexible with employee availability and understanding when it came to leaving for the summer, etc."
good,"I was part time, so I do not know anything about the benefits."
good,i have both good and bad things to say about my time at safeway. for starters safeway is overall a good comapy to work for. all the employees get treated fairly and theres always room to pick up hours. Another positive is the weekly pay and union benefits. My only down fall while working at safeway was the store manager who managed the safeway that i specificly worked at i always felt as those she was out to get me i thought well maybe it was just me till i found out that other employees also had run ins with her and thats when i knew it was her and not me.
good,"Safeway has been an experience for me. It allowed me the opportunity to engage in customer service towards all customers. Although it was a fast pace of work, I enjoyed it."
good,"It is a great place to work because of good pay, benefits and room for advancement. It is a challenging environment that requires a level headed individual if you would like to be successful there."
good,Good working place and working environment if you live close by tto the store. Get paid every week so that was also a plus. Nice managers and cool co workers.
good,"It's a very busy store , was able to learn how to be fast paste , also you deal with alot of different customers . I like how pay it was weekly pay , you learn alot from this company."
good,"A day at work would consist of slicing deli meat, stocking deli in their casing, making food products to be sold on the floor, cleaning/sanitizing counter tops and machinery, assisting/helping customers get what they desire. I learned how to work as a team, help customers the best i can and stay organized/work efficiently. The  facilities management was organized as the schedules for employees were always correct and up to date. Co-workers and myself were always on top of everything and everyone took their part. The culture of the workplace was always positive and friendly with no criticism and judgmental issues. Everybody got along no matter how far apart age gaps seemed to be. The most difficult part of the job was cleaning the machinery because they were often hazardous; knives, meat slicers, etc. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers get their daily groceries and welcoming new people to the family on their first day."
good,"Breaks were well balanced, although were prone to human error (even I was guilty of forgetting to give cashiers their breaks on time if it got busy). When grocery stores started selling beer they provided smart serve training to all cashiers 18 and over and provided time at the workplace to complete said training. The job was relatively easy, it all depended on the kind of customers you encountered. Hardest part of the job was scheduling time off but again, understandable, as well as dealing with shoplifters."
good,"I enjoyed my many years with Safeway "
good,People were friendly and nice to work with. My supervisor was great to work with.The work week was manageable and works loads were fine. it's a place to start a career.
good,"I was at Safeway for most of my career starting out as a baker's apprentice, once I achieved my journeyman certification I soon advanced to management. I worked with a lot of great people over the years and I am still friends with a lot of them."
good,"While a lot of the assistant managers had unrealistic expectations, the general manager and the bakery manager were reasonable people and wonderful bosses. I learned how to work hard and what great customer service looks like."
good,Safeway is a great place to work in retail. Provides great opportunity to work within different areas. Great setting for learning customer service skills.
good,"A secure job, management is really professional. Good value given to seniority.Gets to be very routine after a while."
good,"Enjoyed my co-workers and customers. It is a fast-paced and interesting industry. Employees are friendly, hours can vary weekly. It's beneficial to love the food and grocery business if you work in that area."
good,I have have a positive work experience at Safeway. The customers are nice and the management is fair to every employee. There are plenty of opportunities to move to different departments. The hours that I work are pretty much up to me.
good,Massive company with a very mixed employee field. The company in a whole is highly successful for a reason. Safeway served as a temporary employment while i was between jobs.
good,"My job at Safeway was that of a cashier a typical work day at Safeway would be helping customers with their groceries, basic needs such as asking them if they had a pleasant time shopping at Safeway and if they found everything okay, anything you would expect from a cashier. I learnt many different skills such as time management as I had to be quick and friendly to every singe customer, this helped me improve my customer service skills and understand the needs of every different consumer. The hardest part of my job was standing for long hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers and how friendly everyone was ."
good,"If you have ever worked in a grocery store, especially a big one. Safeway runs the same way. We stock at night when there aren't many people around. It can become very tiring, especially when you are done with stacking and there is nothing else to do. It can become tiresome but overall it is a good place to work. The people were easy to communicate with."
good,"Overall, Safeway was a good first job. I enjoyed learning and valuing the customer service skills I had learned along with running the register at a fast and efficient pace."
good,Its a very quick paced work environment. Depending on the store that you work for your experience can differ greatly. Depending on seniority you may end up working holidays but the pay is great in exchange for working those days
good,Safeway is a good company to work for. You can start at the bottom and work your way up to different departments. They are able to train and willing to give employees chances to learn different department job.
good,I love working for Safeway its just they are unfair with the new people if you already been working for them and you get into a incident with one of the old workers they choose their side I feel as doe that's unfair you let go of talent like that.
good,"You must have food out on time and at the right temperature and keep it rotated through out the day. you don't want to get caught being unfocused because, people consume your food and you represent the company."
good,Always something exciting going on at Safeway.  I loved the management team and the people within the stores.  A good mix of cultures making it always nice to come to work.
good,"Fast paced work environment. standard Stationary engineer position. Took care of boilers, chillers fire system etc... Liked the job just too many double shifts and weekend work."
good,"It has diversity culture environment. Even our family members can do lots of courses along the year via the Union. You can learn lots of things. It's changing the way of productions and presentations. therefore I was  not in board. Customers give their appreciations right in front of you. That is the most satisfied thing in my profession. "
good,"This was my first paid job, and the reason why I would work at this firm is that they taught me how to apply effort into the position as a bakery clerk."
good,"Worked in multiple departments. Learned enough to be able to move on to another company and advance quickly. Face paced, friendly environment. Highly recommend for a first time employee"
good,Safeway was very fast pace which i enjoy. Keeping a tight schedule and needing to be on time was one of the big parts of working their overall good job to have
good,"Working here was a pretty standard, pre-high school graduation job. I showed up after my last class of the day for a shift of 4-8 hours. It was fun, but still work. I made a lot of good lifelong friends at that job, the first outside school or family. I really got to know the people of the neighborhood, as well. My general work day at safeway had been to arrive after school, change into my uniform and head up front, where I bagged groceries and offered take-out assistance, occasionally rounding up carts from the lot, or going out on litter patrol. After about six months, I began working a closing shifts, where I'd add a lot of vacuuming and sweeping and garbage emptying to the end of my night."
good,"Was part time. learned great customer skills. Learned how to set up a deli, slice meet, weigh out salads, close the deli at end of shift. most enjoyable part of job was dealing with customers."
good,"The management was amazing."
good,"If you want to grow in the grocery industry this is a good company to move up in, but you have to get into the right store. That is hard in this area due to the fact that the managers aren't advancing themselves and holding others back."
good,The job was very demanding  in order to meet parameters set for procurement requirements. The job was to forecast the demand for 125 stores and to meet procure estimated amounts of product.
good,Helping customers fine certain food products as well as assisting customers with bagging their groceries and if needed assisting with carrying out their groceries.
good,I made a lot of good friends and acquaintances that I still know and speak to today. It was stressful but your day did go quickly. The deli was a fast paced area that not most can survive.
good,"Safeway was my first store management experience.  While training was adequate, there always seemed to be employee issues, add poor employee training meant high turnover, which made the experience a daily trial"
good,"The workplace was generally, friendly and the managers were easy going. I have been late to work quite a few times without much repercussions. The shifts were pretty long(8 hours) and sometimes got really boring when there were very few customers. First Tuesday of each month was Customer Appreciation Day(10% off if you go over 50$) and it got get really busy and it was very tiring to work those days."
good,"learned about time management"
good,"Safeway was a very fast paced work environment, if you can't be on your feet for long periods of time, this is not for you. Being a courtesy clerk was very easy. It is very hard to move up to be a checker though, but there is a seniority list."
good,Good company to work for. enjoyed working in the grocery business. You first start as a courtesy clerk and easily get promoted depending on you work ethic. Company doesn't pay as much as back in 05.
good,"Overall I enjoyed my employment with Safeway.  Unfortunately, because of the difficulty in filling overnight shifts, many weeks I was receiving full time hours.  I initially signed up for 3 nights a week because of my other full-time employment.  The approximately 70-75 hours per week of work combining the 2 jobs became too burdensome."
good,"Being able to work hard and still able to have fun with co-workers, at least at my store. There is always something to do and most will teach you anything you want to learn to do."
good,"Fast paced , busy ,  holidays are chaos, large staffed , corporate, and union business , paid fairly , great hours, great customer satisfaction,  great staff treatment , raise opportunities,  advancement opportunities."
good,Safeway extern for a few months. Great learning opportunity. The manager at Safeway pharmacy was amazing & really helped me out. Wonderful employees & not too high stress.
good,"I have learned so much in my career, they provided so much information to their employee, good benefits. The only downside is when you are at the top rate there is only cents increase per year"
good,"A nice job if you want an ""8 and skate"" career. Requires great people skills; if you don't have them, they'll teach you. Love working with such an interesting customer base!"
good,"Piece of cake. As long as you use common sense and a great attitude, it's a simple job. Customer relations, product knowledge, and efficiency make everything that much simpler."
good,Great company to work for and they offer great benefits. Management is wonderful and listens to their employees. It was a good experience to part of the company.
good,I like working in the deli  I learned how to prep food slice meat & work with customer that had orders for christms events. food safety was a big part of my job I made sure I fowled all the rules
good,If I were to be completely honest; Vons was my 1st job and I actually liked it. I had no problems with people. Everyone was very chill and very helpful.
good,"I started out working the coffee bar and quickly was moved to the deli, where I became the first female Chinese food cook. I then advanced to the pharmacy which I loved"
good,This is the first job were everybody helped out it just made the days go by faster. And by far the best management I have worked for so far out of all my jobs
good,At Safeway i beleive that the company suffers from a lack of leadership and a disconnect from its evey day employees due to lack of communication i like it because there is a measurable amount of work that needs to be ✔
good,Working at safeway was great I was the store bookkeeper so I worked alone until my work was done and I had to stay to assist the cashiers.I also lived about 25 mins away and had another job so that really is the only reason I resigned.
good,"Very flexible hours for people with other commitments (sports, other jobs etc.)"
good,Good place to work . Opportunities to grow in the company. Management was outstanding. Great atmosphere and good team to work with.Alot of overtime available.With regular raises.
good,Basically ya come in and do your job. Keep your work area clean. Work as much backstock as possible. Help out where you can when you can. Coworkers are hit or mis. Benefits are great.
good,"In my 30 years with them , they provided many opportunities for advancement , Training was excellent and you always knew where you stood with them.  I enjoyed being a store manager."
good,"A typical day at work looks like bagging groceries, collecting carts, sweeping the store, cleaning spills, cleaning bathrooms and taking out the trash. I learned to be flexible. Management was good. Workplace culture was pretty good. The hardest part of the job was getting everything done in a short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends."
good,"I've learned many things at the deli such as learning how to cook, bake and providing customers of what they need in the deli. They are very professional when it comes to job management; they will take care of you and you're schedule"
good,"being a large chain they are able to pay better and are more professional than grocery outlet. I worked grave yard, but was unable to adjust to that life schedule."
good,i usually worked weekends so it was usually busy all the time. but when not busy at later hours it was just standing around doing nothing. hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers
good,"What i loved about working at Safeway is I learned a lot by working in diffirent departments and trades in the store. "
good,"I worked in the deli in which I learned how to prepare food and interact with costumers.  The workplace environment was very welcoming, I got along very well with my coworkers."
good,Nice place to work. Friendly people.  Great customers.  Friendly people. Nice place to work.   Great customers.  Great customers. Nice place to work. Friendly people.
good,"a typical day at Safeway I would star at the cash register or self check out and greet my shift lead and manager as well as customers I see on a daily  bases and even the new faces ."
good,"From clocking on, to clocking out, there is always something to do. It is different in each department. But I did enjoy working for Safeway in the floral department."
good,"Kind of wish I had more hours at the particular time hoping that they will be a little bit flexible because I end up getting sick I end up being now announce with cancer"
good,"loved it.  good experience.  wouldn't do it again.   liked it at the time,  in my younger years.    good bye  I don't have more to say by the over priced  store."
good,Every day I went to work it was a spontaneous routine of attending to all work available from going to help a checker in need of bagging for customers and keeping spontaneous whenever there was other work to find within the store. It was easy to be dependable and attentive to the customers and employees whenever help was needed and I remained on my feet to be useful. It could be stressful to get rushed or running back and forth to get price checks or item checks on very fast-paced days but I managed to make it through with keeping everyone pleased and satisfied. It was a friendly collaborative and steadfast working environment overall and it has been easy to miss the spontaneous fast-paced routine that it was all about.
good,"The most enjoyable part of work is through serving costumers. I learned how to manage my time, be a team player and to move and think quickly. the environment is also diverse and people working there were very nice and helpful"
good,"Safeway is a very friendly and learning environment. Great coworkers, good atmosphere, and easy to adjust to. Management is very supportive, patient, and helpful."
good,"This is a great first job or temporary job. Hours and scheduling is flexible, but usually for long hours as Deli staffing is generally low. Deli is a great place to learn and develop skills needed in other career paths. You learn self-control, time management, suggestive selling, collaborating with other departments and co-workers, and organization. Management is nice, but would push more onto you then they realize, often adding unnecessary stress to unrealistic goals. Although customers can be irate at times, they in addition to your co-workers are what really makes work enjoyable. Cracking a couple jokes, catching up with a regular, and looking forward to seeing those faces can make any day a good one."
good,i have worked there for 8 months and it was great and the only reason why i left was only because my hours did get cut a lot and i at that time did get a new job that did happen to pay better but i definitely would have stayed if i had my original hours
good,"I working with this company over 23 years."
good,I enjoyed working here. Lots of room for promotion. Pay was alright. Management wants you to grow here. I say the hardest part of this job would be customer service.
good,Working in the bakery at Safeway will definitely put you in shape. You will throw freight 3 times a week and make product then mix dough and make lots of bread. Very physical job.
good,"early mornings, constant customers, easy relaxing job for most part, pay not the best, couldn't take any tips, great benefits, awesome starbucks manager, store manager okay."
good,The atmosphere and requirements for the job keep you in your toes. This makes the job fun and entertaining however management can be hard to deal with and a I experienced dissatisfaction with one manager in particular.
good,"Safeway is a place to learn new things with co-workers, aswell as helping customers. It is challenging and fast at times which helps young people grow and become better. I would recommend Safeway to new workers."
good,Good part-time job while in school. Scheduling can be problematic in that changes are made with little notice. Overall a good part-time job for a student.
good,Working for safeway was challenging as per the hours they needed workers.  A devide from employees and managers. Customers were great.  Some work there was fun and exciting.
good,I am an Associate at Safeway and one of the most enjoyable parts of my job is the interaction with all my regular customers who have shopped here for years. I have fantastic management and co-workers.
good,"Safeway runs a tight work force. Hours depend on your strengths. I recommend working at Safeway. If you want it , its all yours. People working for the people. A fine work place for contiued success of a company."
good,"I worked for Safeway for about a year and very much enjoyed my time there. I worked with a great team of cashiers and courtesy clerks, and always had an enjoyable time when I worked there, whether it was bagging groceries, working the check stand, or stocking shelves."
good,A good place to start out with lots of things to learn. Managment is nice and is understanding if you do need time off as long as work hard. You will be working a lot of different shifts in different departments.
good,"it is a good job i have no complaints whatsoever worling at safeway,i have been working here for a while andi enjoy doing what i do,its nothing difficult but pay can be better"
good,As a college student the hours provided fit my schedule perfectly. Crew members were friendly and helpful. Pay was fit for the job being completed. Flexible schedule
good,"had to start at the bottom and quickly with learning the deli job, I advanced to department manager in less than 7 years. Demands from upline was sometimes stressful, but in order to follow safeway standards they needed to do their jobs."
good,"The store manager could have better overall. But the front end managers and assistants were fun to work under and made the job better. The job itself was easy and having holiday pay, overtime, and paid vacation was nice to have."
good,"Working at Safeway is definitely fun. Interacting with customers and fellow co-workers is always fun and engaging. While pushing carts in the middle of summer isn't the best, your always able to get a drink of water at the Starbucks inside."
good,"I really enjoyed working in the bakery. I started as a donut fryer and then moved up from there. I have done all the jobs that need to be done in the bakery. Donut fryer, packager,cake decorator and baker. When I left safeway I was secound in charge. Just below the manager in that department."
good,"Safeway was a good company to work for. The hours were reasonable, management was easy to work with and pay was reasonable.  Unfortunately Safeway outsourced my position to another company."
good,"Working in customer service is a great way to learn how to act as a decent human being. Having to serve others that come in to get their necessary groceries gives you the chance to learn how to handle many different types of personalities and needs. You learn the importance of money and the complexities of our payment system; whether they be cash, credit cards, or ebt. The wide range of positions and jobs available can be daunting, but it also lets you learn what you do and do not like about a specific job or what you are good at."
good,Safe way gas clerk was my first job at being a gas clerk. For the most part it was very laid back and not to stressful. The part that got stressful was when the pumps decided not to work.
good,"Fast paced, go, go, go. You can work your way up quick, just work hard. You Wii boot get promised full time, but if you work hard, you will get you share!"
good,Paid the bills. Did mainly just grocery stocking. Was using it as just a stepping stone job to get to the next job. Recommend working if you are in school.
good,"Very Culture driven company.  Has great advancement opportunities  You get to meet with Senior management on a regular basis, and talk about the success of your teams"
good,"in my role, my job was to keep the front end moving smoothly. I was to help out in whatever role was needed of my on a daily basis. I was a cashier when needed, or customer service representative or a supervisor."
good,It was an interesting place to work. Met some very good friends and providing customer service is always a plus.i don't have much more to say. Everyone including management were highly competant.
good,"It was my first job and I worked there 2 yrs through out high school. The job was very good, people friendly, management was knowledgeable and environment cleaning."
good,"While walking to the break room to clock on before the start of my shift I never had a complete idea of what I was going to be doing for the day. While I knew I would likely be bagging, cleaning, gathering carts, or taking out the garbage for a few hours of the day there was always something unpredictable. Once clocked in it is important to know that even though you are assigned a task for that certain hour chances are you will be taking on more than that task. Anyone can succeed at Safeway if they are able to accept that and work as a team."
good,"Process customers purchases by payment of cash, credit  or debit. Treat each person with respect. Stock items on shelves during down time. Assist customers to find items that is needed to purchase."
good,"There is ALWAYS something to be done. You will learn how to manage your time as well as master multi-tasking. Communication is key in the store. Fun place to work, fun employees!"
good,Wonderful work environment  with positive co workers. Typical day day work was being responsible for resets. I worked on my own making sure all new products were in place at the right time paying attention to product placement. The culture of Aisle One was one of consistency. The hardest part of the job was being accountable for product placement and the company. I enjoyed the responsibility it required.
good,its a good place to work and they hire good people everyone is very polite and helpful really no complaints I wish I could still work there today the pay was good the work was easy and the managers were great
good,"Safeway is a great company to work for because  they give you benefits , discounts , and 401 k, and the people are great there . i learned how to bag groceries properly. but a typical day at work at Safeway as a courtesy clerk was very busy , bagging peoples groceries, receiving carts from outside , cleaning the bathroom , and taking back food items people did not want ,"
good,"everything is face paced especially for a courtesy clerk. However some days are slow, nut manageable. the managers are understanding. employees are good sometimes have their good and bad days but doesn't let it affect the work space."
good,"I came to work, never missed a day of work. Performed my job to best of my ability every day. Helped others that needed help. Assisted with daily orders/purchasing and inventory. Kept my section in tip-top shape, and got better each day."
good,"a typical day at work consisted of merchandising, stocking and helping customers, i learned alot about different types of produce and why theyre good for you. the hardest part of the job was the cleaning of the coolers. the most enjoyable part was being able to assist customers"
good,Safeway strives to bring the best customer service by accommodating and making sure there customers are taken care of. They maintain a good staff and are very reasonable with meeting the needs of the company but there employees too.
good,I loved Safeway. Kept me busy and happy. I had a consistent schedule and I was considered often when making decisions that affect me. Would work for Safeway again
good,"I enjoyed my time at safeway because of the people I worked with directly every day. I learned a lot about business, customer service, and food prep/safety."
good,"Working nights is a way different than working days. At nights your in charge of getting the product to the shelf within in a reasonable time frame. Once the freight is thrown, product must be pulled to the edge of the shelf. Typical how we face is you bring two forward. At about 2:30 am, I start ordering. This normally means going through the isles and ordering products that are low or out of stock."
good,it was a very nice place to work. All my employees were very nice to me and they were happy if I did the best that I could. They had to let me go for unknown reasons.
good,i would have to wear a hair net and beard net which was reasonable due to the fact i was handling food some days were busy then some slow and then some days in was in between
good,i loved working for safeway they were friendly and understanding to my needs. the only part i did not like was the younger group coming and not doing their job and bringing drama into the work place.
good,"My job at Safeway was fun. It was fun to come to work and interact with my co-workers and the customers when I passed them in the aisle. People were very friendly, and on occasion, not so friendly, but I assumed they were having a bad day. Overall, I got along with everyone."
good,"Working in Starbucks inside of Safeway was pretty simple. The worst part of the job was being required to serve people before your kiosk was open which would put you behind for the rest of the day. I don't know if that is still required of Baristas. Other than that, the job was fairly easy."
good,"Cashiers make on average 8.75$/hour, which is a respectable wage. Maybe actually enough to live on if you have a roommate. But for part time or full time work if you live with others, it's acceptable."
good,"Employees are treated fairly, fun atmosphere, Safeway provides a 10 percent discount on groceries to it's employees. Staff/Supervisors are friendly to each other."
good,"Albertson bought company and everything went down hill. Benefits cut in half  poor management"
good,I managed the Deli Department with a total staff of 5. I tried to create a fun environment for everyone to work in. Retail can be a challenge. People aren't always the nicest. I went out of my way to insure customers got what they needed.
good,"i worked in the bakery for 2 years just out of high school, i loved my work, i was good at it, but i kept getting write ups for my tattoos and piercings. nowadays they do not discriminate against either of those things"
good,"I did like working here, there were stressful days, and sometimes management was stretch thin. "
good,"Hey, I had a fun time on trying to make customers happy. I did like having a lot of things to do through out the day. The mangers worked out my schedur. so that my dad can drop me off and for him to go to work."
good,"Friendly and positive setting,and good place for an opportunity to advance.safeway allowed me work in a few department within their store which gave me the chance to do different duties."
good,"Really enjoyed working for Safeway."
good,"Job duties as courtesy clerk consisted, sweeping the "
good,Very nice place to work. You will meet a lot of people. You must be energetic. Always keep a clear head because there will be times when the customer won’t be happy but it will be your job to make them happy and want to come back.
good,"they treat their employees equal and they make sure safety is number one priority , they give people rise if they work hard , an vacations are paid for"
good,I would like to be off weekends because I have small kids. You’re required to multi task when others aren’t. For the same pay. Want to learn new things about other jobs.
good,"When it’s busy it’s fun! Makes the time go by faster and enjoyable. Constantly cleaning. When not busy theirs always something to do such as;  brewing coffee, looking for expired dates, cleaning syrup pumps, pitchers, blenders etc."
good,"Under new management things have been changing for the better for employees, flexible schedules, never miss out on breaks, union-very secure, staff is very friendly to new comers and management is very helpful in any situation, training is short and sweet and additional help is given whenever needed. Very welcoming space and it’s fun to be there once you’ve found your footing"
good,Always had a good day at Safeway. Majority of customers were happy & always friendly. Management was good & employees were treated fairly. Nothing negative.Days could be quiet & could also be busy but always left happy at the end of the day.
good,Great place to work while going to school. It allows you to transfer stores to relocate closer to an area in which you want to go to college. Always an opportunity to move up in the company.
good,"Working at a widely known grocery store was like being a juggler. You have your main job, then are asked to help in a different area of the store. Different departments would be short handed and the over flow from other departments would fill in."
good,"The Vons that I worked at was amazing! I loved my store managers, Even after the switch. Terry was always looking out for us. Never had a problem. Working for his company was one of the best things I've ever did."
good,Howlette all look great place to work. The existence of the union really helped deal with management when there was issues that arose. they were very accommodating with scheduling
good,Easy but hard working job. Get to communicate with people all day. Was able to learn about the necessary things you have to do when working at a grocery store.
good,You must be able to multitask and get as much production done as you possible can to make sure that we have everything we possibly can to insure customer satisfactory. Must be willing to work efficiently hard to be able to give great customer service
good,"Every time I walk in the store to clock in nothing but smiles, Learned everything from being a clerk to being in the deli and in the meat department, management are always very good to their employers, hardest part about work would be would five dollar Fridays, Most enjoyable part of the would be getting all the work done for the day!"
good,"It was an overall great environment to be in. I enjoyed every day I was there! I loved everyone that worked there, we all got along great and I enjoyed the customers that came in!"

good,I really enjoyed working at Safeway.  I learned many things and more than I ever wanted to in a small town.  My coworkers are still my friends and feel like family.
good,i mean its a very fast paced work place and they have a really good union for the deli bakery and meat department. but the management can sometimes be kinda weird but overall its good!!
good,"At Safeway, hours are being cut for both the Pharmacist and the Technicians and more responsibilities are being added to their plate. If you need to work full time hours there is minimal assistance in finding locations which need help."
good,Safeway doesn't provide the hours needed to properly run the store. One person has to work extra hard to get things done. They do pay their manager well.
good,The job was slow at times. But it had its busy days. The trainer i had was amazing and told me to learn every drink that was offered on the menu. And to practice making them SO that way they was known by memory
good,Typical days r busy
good,"I love dealing with people so this was the perfect job to start my working career in. This job right out of High School groomed me to always give 110%, always be friendly even when having a bad day, taught me to work with others as a team and to always be trustworthy & dependable."
good,good moral between coworkers. the hardest part of the job was not knowing when you would be able to go home. the most enjoyable part of the job were the medical and dental benifits.
good,"Typical day of work consists of dealing with a wide range of people working through the doors and you learn how to work with them properly."
good,"nice place to work, really focused on customer service, long days sometimes short of help. otherwise a nice place to work. was sold to Albertsons recently."
good,I actually enjoyed working for safeway only thing I don't approve of is them firing you or letting you go because you call off dye to a family emergency
good,"If you enjoy working with people, this is the place to work. They have high standards on customer service. It is a very fast paced environment, great place to work"
good,"I started as a courtesy clerk collecting shopping carts, maintaining the store, and bagging groceries. Later I was promoted to stock clerk/cashier. I would work the register when needed but my primary job was to restock and maintain the isles assigned to me."
good,"Very accommodating for flexible schedules, friendly customer base and reliable supporting staff. Would work at the company again with no hesitation. Loved it."

good,"It can be a fun place to work but for the pay I definetly need something better, everyone has fun there but if you aren't getting paid enough or getting enough hours you need something better."
good,"Safeway is a great first job with encouraging co-workers. It was  pretty busy most of the time so I always had something to do which I loved. My favorite part of the job was giving carry-out service to customers because I got to have one on one conversations with  them and really get to know the customers more. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts in bad weather. While working there I got to learn the store pretty well which made it easier for me to help customers. I also learned how to work with other people which made the job less stressful. Before I started working at Safeway I was pretty anti-social, but that soon changed overtime since my jobs purpose was customer service. Overall, the workers and customers were great which made it a pretty good first job."
good,"It's   nice place to work, for a start if u are in school, flexible schedules and time to relax and has a workers comp which  I personally didn't like"
good,"I enjoyed almost every day working here. my co-workers were kind and wonderful people who always went out of there way to help create a wonderful work environment. the managers were easy to talk to and trust to ensure a safe and productive workplace. the hardest part of the job was never knowing how customers were going to act, thankful I learned to adapt to situations and learned to talk to management if it was inappropriate or went too far. the most enjoyable part were the regular customers who came in and always treated me kindly and with respect, making my day better if I had a rough start."
good,"Great company to work for. Most innovative, well managed, good working conditions, good wages. Well provided training, work tools, & necessary requirements provided to do the job, well"

good,"Working at Safeway, I learned customer service skills, working as cashier, stocking, helping customers locate items they were looking for, and money handling. A typical day at this job was between slow and fast-paced, I was constantly helping customers with locating items or just checking them out at the register. The most enjoyable part about the job was being able to learn all the different skills I was able to pick up on. The hardest part of the job was that the management wasn't flexible so it didn't work around my schedule when I needed it to."
good,It was an ok job ok pay management could have been better and they could have looked out for there employees more then harsh costumers but overall it was an easy mice job to have
good,Company does not put huge importance on the happiness of their employees because there is such high turnover. More concerned about your ability to do the job at the current time than keeping you long term.
good,"As #1 grocery chain in CA, it was easy to see why Safeway was so successful. Incredibly smart people at all levels, and most employees were long-term and very loyal, having worked up from stores."
good,"I enjoyed working at Safeway  learning about produce & produts of shelves & helping the customers one on one , mangers we good with days off & shedules"
good,"I would say  that my work day was productive and busy depending on what day it is and what promotions that were going on hit can get crazy busy. I learned to multi task more effectively and to be more patient with customers and my employees,"
good,"I learned how to work on computers and a few other things like operating card board machines,operating bubble wrap machines and other e-waste tools they have"
good,Work is fast pace but you get credit for a job well done .Management is understanding on days off needed .Get to meet a lot of people work indoors cool when its hot outside warm when its cold outside.
good,"Great colleagues and management (if you were lucky enough to get a manager that cared about you). It is retail with slim margins so that navigating budgets and constant budget cuts, and changes in direction made it challenging."
good,"This was a job that I felt fulfilled at. However we had to meet goals in the pharmacy to help the store meet payroll. It was very stressful, and situations were not handled correctly."
good,"Worked for this company for 5 years until the store was closed and I was made redundant. "
good,"I worked at DotCom department in Safeway so the shifts started at 4 am. It was really a great temporary job because it fitted my school schedule and them willing to work with you on the hour per day you wanted to work. The job is fairly easy, you come in every morning and pick items that the customers placed online and get ready for it to be delivered."
good,"This is my favorite job so far, because I adapted very well to the work and people, did very well, got lots of help and training and loved my co-workers!"

good,"Working at Safeway required diligence and the ability to work efficiently even if others did not. They do focus alot upon customer service and ""the customer is always right"".

good,"Even though I was a courtesy clerk, I had many positions. I had to work in the back assorting and cutting fruits and vegetables. I also had to stock merchandise."
good,"Fast paced as closing cashier all of the out of town and locals would rush in for final items. I would stay late after hours to assist customers.

They never really listened to the employees even when a complaint was made about another department manager. I enjoyed the people and working with the team we had."

good,"i do cashier  recieve payment  by cash,checks,credit card debit card, and voucher "
good,when you first get there you check out the call sheet to see what duties you have to do. i learned how to talk to customers in a friendly and polite manner.

I did only work around 30 hours per week though. After transferring to the bakery and becoming a baker/cake decorator I really enjoyed my job and received 2 weeks of paid time off per year, and paid sick leave as well as the other benefits. I was getting paid somewhat higher than minimum wage with regular salary increases and the option to achieve journeyman status, which would have raised my wages above $15/hr. However, the job was somewhat stressful and it was important to work quickly with a sense of urgency. I wish I had not left my job as a baker/cake decorator."

good,"Fast paced,  challenging and many opportunity's."

good,During opening shift you pull stock off the shelf that has reached expiration.  To ensure quality you take temps of the products that have been left on the wall. Then you fill out the production log to see what needs to be made for the day. As you make product you wash quality shipped fruits and vegetables. After making the products you cool the fruits and vegetables to standard temperature. This job is relatively easy once you pick up pace. The hardest part of the job is cutting warm onions. Management is nice and they have a welcoming work culture.
good,safeway was a good company to work for. I had no problems working there I was there over 5 years until the closed my store so I decided to try something different

good,"I generally enjoyed working here as the staff and overall environment was supportive. However, my only concern was the rotating of new managers in which schedules were changed without notice. This occurred a few times but it was still a annoying problem!"
good,"My workday... customer service is the name of the game here and I enjoyed every minute of it. This job also can challenge you to be and do, the best you on a daily basis. To me, it doesn't matter where you work, management only wants you to do what you are there for to the best of your ability. Work."
good,"Good company & benefits. I worked in the Starbucks department but was a Safeway employee, we weren't allowed to except tips. Very busy at times & not always enough coverage. Room for advancement"
good,"My time spent at Vons, was a very memorable time indeed. The job itself was very fast paced, which really made the time fly by. I could not have asked for better co-workers. I believe it is the phenomenal people that work there, that truly made it an experience worth having."
good,Great place to work. Great employees. The atmosphere is calm. I always had agood time working. The store was always clean. Customers always happy. Recommend.
good,"Minimal complaints, worked here for 8 years and they treated me quite well. I seldom had any issues and when there were issues they were mostly always handled appropriately."
good,"Safeway was a great job to have, while i was in school they were very aware of my school schedule and helped in making work and balancing school very easy."
good,"if you are looking for a part time job while going to college, something with basic benefits then safeway is a good place to work. guaranteed 24 hours through the union, nice people and friendly customers."
good,"Even as a contractor, I experienced good teamwork in resolving technical issues."
good,I enjoyed working here if you get into the right store with the right crew it becomes like a family. I spent most of my life working with this company.
good,"Good place to work. Friendly customers, trustworthy co-workers, and plenty of room for advancement. I worked in a small store, so it wasn't as hectic as working in a bigger store."
good,Safeway was a good place to work. The benefits were outstanding.Working in the deli gave me great knowledge of all deli products.I also learned alot in the seafood department.Working in a grocery store environment is a great place to work.
good,good co-workers hard work at times picking up carts outside garbage and different stuff. fun first time job learn a lot  of different departments and cosormer service skills
good,"enjoyed my coworkers and overall experience with this company, sometimes things did get rather annyoing without having enough people on the payroll and hours had to be filled kinda took all of my personal life but it was overall a decent job and full of decent working people."
good,"I had to clean to store up and the bathrooms, stock the store, bag the food and help people to the car. it was something i a had to get use to and i learned fast"
good,Management and people were fun to work with. Work was balanced and pretty straightforward and not too demanding. Pay was good and hours were good. Was a great first job and was not upset working there.
good,Nice staff and management. They had snacks in the break room and got me out on time most of the time. Wouldn't get annoyed if I asked for time off and were always really sweet when I came in on my days off.
good,Great place it a way to meet people and get to make relationships with them. Favorite part was getting the regular costumers in and knowing what they already wanted to drink
good,I learned alot about being a supervisor and how to better help a customer. Today it has helped me tremendously to be able to continue my learning and use it in my new jobs
good,If you like working with people and love helping customers to either check-out their goods then this is it because you would be helping people with what ever they want.
good,"This job was a great environment to learn and be trained in, the people who worked there where friendly and professional."
good,"As a part-time worker, I did not get to truly reap the benefits of Safeway, though when I worked there I could see that it was a pretty good place to work."
good,safeway is one of the better places i have worked. it's hard but fair work. all the managers at my store were very understanding and worked with you on any problems you may have. only down side i would say is you don't get full hours.
good,working at Safeway was a great learning experience to build a great foundation in customer service skills. if i have had the opportunity to work at ranstad(Google work project) i would still be working at Safeway. its a great place to work yourself up the latter and learn from the different departments. Safeway really take care of the employees
good,"This location was by far one of my best working experiences.  My management team was great, and they encouraged my growth within the company.  Our team worked very well together which made it such a pleasant place to work."
good,"If you have never had a job this would be a great place to start at. Courtesy clerks have the easiest job, If you could put up with the supervisors then it shouldn't be a problem, all you do most of the time is bag groceries for customers."
good,Each day of work at Safeway taught me quick and effective stocking techniques. Maintaining a clean and organized store. Assisting customers to find product and the best deals. The management was flexible with employees needs as well as their work schedule. The company worked promptly to award raises to hard working employees and pushed to help excel them to higher positions of the company if requested.The Graveyard shift was the most difficult part of the job considering it was 11pm to 7am.
good,"My job involved working with customers, employees and management.  Constantly changing, everyday was different.  Counting money, doing deposits, reports."
good,"Courtesy Clerk: Provided excellent customer service; assisted with client requests & offering cashier support, maintained a safe & clean shopping environment."
good,I haven't been working at Safeway long enough to give a hard and strong opinion of the place.. That being said so far I like it. My co-workers and my customers tend to be friendly for the most part. Its a nice place to work.
good,I have been working as cashier over the past years and  I always enjoy dealing with customer and solved their problems.I always communicate with all tape of people.
good,They were pretty cool about everything you just come in an do your job and the people were cool at least where I worked. It may vary from place to place.
good,Arrive to work on time clocking in cleaning and making sure your check stand is ready for customers going on break is the best part because some customers can be rude but the most part some customers are very nice you can learn a lot from them
good,Safeway is a fast-paced working evironment. Management is there to help you learn and to get to where you want to go. The department is constantly training the employees so that we are all up to date and on the same level too achieve our goals.
good,"Start your morning by walking the store, check for store conditions and communicate with department heads to identify any opportunities if they arise and start a list of action items. Check emails and distinguish which items to prioritize (throughout the day). Walk the store while performing your daily tasks, communicate with your team every hour or so to get a feel for the pulse of your store. The people I work with at Safeway are great! I've been to a handful of stores and have met some of my best friends in the Safeway work environment. I've learned a lot while working with Safeway, not only about how to run a retail setting but also about life. Safeway has taught me to take nothing for granted and has helped me immensely with my financial goals. The challenging part of the job is managing the resources given and translating that into growing sales while margins shrink. The most enjoyable is working  people, customers and employees alike."
good,I learned how to be productive and how to minimize movements to boost productivity.  How to build loads to be shipping without hurting the contents.  How to use a motorized pallet jack.
good,"Worked as a bagger clerk for a little over a year until I became a checker/cashier. This was my high school job, really no complaints, too young to know any different. Very easy job."
good,Great job if you like people and customer service.  There are many positions available in all stores so you never get bored doing the same old thing.  Advancement and training is always available.
good,"over all i had a good time working here, i never really had any problems and the work space was always friendly. the managers always helped out when i was asking and they would give me good tips and ways to do things when they saw i was struggling"
good,Easy work. Only problem being a lack of management knowledge on how the store actually runs. Feels like random people thrown into management sometimes.
good,"Reasonably enjoyable job. Knew what to expect every shift. Learned how to manage time (how much I can reasonably get done in a shift). Mostly worked closing shift, so I often only saw my other coworkers for maybe an hour before they all went home. At times this was a pro, as it meant I could quietly go about my business. Cons were that if you encountered a problem (either with a customer or with a machine) you couldn't ask for help. When asking for time off, you had to submit a paper request which was put into a folder. I was a little paranoid that there was a possibility that the paper could get lost. Would have preferred and electronic system. Management was alright. Store managers were friendly and came when paged on the intercom. Bakery manager was really nice. Only issue was sometimes I wouldn't get my schedule until a few days before the start of the next week. Would have preferred something like 3 weeks scheduling in advance. Overall, pleasant experience. There was enough for me to do that kept me busy every shift. So time went by quickly which I appreciated."
good,"First job in pharmacy. Management always encouraging, willing to help out. Learned a lot. "
good,"Great job for someone in college, seeing that you can only start off part-time and it pays 15 an hour. "
good,"At safeway you learn to operate more than one department. I would be working all day in the parking lot rounding up shopping carts, then get asked to come help with bagging. I advanced to become a produce clerk within months. Great place to seek advancement and higher paying positions."
good,i enjoyed working for Safeway. i spent 5 years there and i moved up the line pretty quickly. Safeway is all about customer service and is very people oriented.
good,I enjoyed working at safeway.. I met great friends and learned a lot about the company as well.. I like how they only use local products from within the city
good,Working on the checkouts serving customers. Promoted to Back Up Supervisor and after eleven months I was promoted to a full time Supervisor's position.
good,I like to work here because its a good way to keep me busy.  I can affored my needs and keep me on a good foot. I think I need a little more time and payments to be a great job
good,"Friendly place to work, learn good skills.  Learned new checkout register system, learned front desk management, managers were cool, customers usually friendly unless they thought they didn't get a sale, but then I could ask the manager to deal with it."
good,"Working at Safeway you must be a lot of things, but efficient is the one thing stands above the rest. As a union worker you are expected to work fast and hard daily."
good,"busy monday through friday. weekends were slow and steady. i learned how to stock and be more associative with people. management was fair, it was nice and clean place. the hardest part was pushing the carts inside in the snow, the most enjoyable part was we all got along at safeway"
good,"It was a great starting job, figuring out the working world, learning many useful skills for many other fields. The employees were lovely to work with but, similar to other retail jobs, customers can be disrespectful and unpleasant. The best part of my job was consistency, never doubting my role in the company, and being able to help others in need, both customers and co-workers. The hardest part of my job was having to calmly handle aggressive customers."
good,"Dealing with customers, handling cash, balancing tills, on computer and paper, handing out cash wages to staff. Taking telephone calls and using tannoy."
good,"Basic training and space for skill development was given. "
good,"This job is a straightforward job with many opportunities being with the union. The employees are kind and friendly. However, management can be frisky at times."
good,A typical day at work is you go clock into the system. You head back too your where the items you sell on the shelf and see which one you need to start cutting up first(either vegetables or fruits) to make sure the shelves are never empty of items. After you figure out what you need to start working on you go back to your work space and start working. Pretty soon you end up realizing that your work day is done and head home.
good,"No day is really average, sometimes busy, sometimes slow. Can be asked to help in other departments. Besides food clerk I am the safety champion, I was taught how to work the liquor department and GM department. Management is ok, through your career you can report to different management and some you will not be too fond of. The hardest thing is when we do not have enough food clerk staff and customers complain about the wait time to check out. When you get the right staff working together who communicate and help each other out is the best and you are helping to be there."
good,"safeway was a good place to work at. i enjoyed it a lot, they kept me busy and asked a lot of me but that is okay because they would be positive to all workers"
good,I bagged grocery's and worked in the deli I learned how to be a team-member my store was very busy but I loved the fast work jobs. I believe I did well because I moved up and had more response ability I open the deli some mornings.
good,Safeway was a really cool place to work i loved it there. I was in the bakery department and loved going to work most days. The pay was every week so that was a plus too.
good,"Before restructuring, good leadership and had plenty of opp the growth . Co workers were friendly and helpful. They encouraged ppl to work at different departments . I learned a lots when I was at different categories. It was a fun job!"
good,"its been a good job ! fun people  to work with , fun customers. good benefits and vacation , now I just need to stay with the company if they with take my transfer!"
good,Great place to work love the workers and management always a blast to work with. It is a fast work pace and always has room for advancement in the company .
good,"Safeway Courtesy Clerk- Summer 2014"
good,"I enjoyed working at Safeway, good place to work for good hours and pay, only left because I became pregnant and was to sick to work at the time, would work there again"
good,"Great experience working with wonderful, hard working, and dedicated group of individuals during the past 23 years. Able to maintain great relationships in and out side of work."
good,a great first job for anybody. i started when i was 15 and still wish i was there in a way. perks arent really that great but alot of incentive if you stay for along time
good,I like working for Safeway because i had enough experience in retail.I like working with public and be able to assist customers in their needs and follow company policies.
good,"Managing customer services and needs as well as associate performance.   "
good,"The people were friendly and were very appreciative of hard work. At times of the day there would be rushes but that should be expected and we got through them as a team. I worked as a night time supervisor and was responsible for all of the employees in the store so I'd have to jump between departments making sure everything was getting done while also getting my work done by the end of the night. I'd often have to work after my shift ended if the day was too busy. It was hard being a full time student and full time employee, but I finally made it through school, so it's not impossible."
good,"Your typical grocery store. Fun coworkers. Engaging managers, very understanding. Very flexible hours. No employee discounts, which sucks. Very clean environment."
good,when i worked there i had fun and good hours good team players and i would work there again and i think they should not lay people off for no reason and keep good workers like me
good,"- Enjoyable and busy"
good,"Safeway was my first experience working at 16. it was wonderful to be apart of a team working together to operate a store. I regularly helped all departments with collecting supplies and taking trash for them, I built store displays daily. I had a nightly responsibility of stocking all display shelves and making sure the entire store was swept and mopped."
good,This was a great place to learn about management I had a team backing me up the entire time and I learned a lot from the experience. Great employees and a great management team
good,"Working in deli requires a lot of patience, and being able to handle meats. Safeway benefits were amazing, and although I found it difficult to meet people there was a lot of job security. The management really depends, I've had micromanaging in how to cut  a sandwich in half to another who allowed me to work on different areas as needed."
good,I work for only 4 hours either two days or 3 days out of week but I've learned a lot since that's what I'm goin to school for . which is pastry chef so. the management is nice they don't like to give over time to whos that want it I thought I was going to be getting at least 30 hours but not even that I'm only getting 12 hours .
good,"I enjoyed working for Safeway because my work was interesting and somewhat challenging. I would code and process all invoices for two warehouses and I had to make sure all work was accurate and balanced . There were times when the work was challenging but fun. Great group of people to work with. I don't think there were very many times when I found the work itself to be hard but in some cases there were one or two persons that were hard to work for. The most enjoyable part was when I was able to help other employees gain experience in the accounting field."
good,"If you work a certain amount of hours (20 I believe) you receive benefits. Loved my coworkers, felt like a second family. Great customers and relationships that last! Not much discounts or anything for employees unfortunately. Good job security; everyone needs to eat right!"
good,Excellent starting point. this company is a great place to start a career and it assists with your growth. Great overall experience.
good,my management team did an excellent job of making sure the customers got the service they needed and made sure all employees had the proper training to complete their assigned tasks.
good,Everyone that worked there was normally always in a positive mood and always willing to help everyone. Only negative thing would be the customers that would come into your line that would try to ruin your day
good,"Safeway is a nice company to work for, nice customers and co-workers, I  learned how much people out there are addicted to narcotic, seeing new born and hearing elderly's surgery stories, co-worker transfer in between store stories. The hardest part for me are ""medicare's payment rules"", I enjoy working at Safeway, because i get to hear new stories everyday from different customers."
good,It is all about getting your team to work together if you are able to build one or inherit on the quicker you get them to buy into your vision and get the main players in your store on your team the quicker you will succeed but you fail at winning the players over you will lose.
good,Safeway was a great company to work for with exceptional benefits. My daily routine was consistent and well structured.  Management was supportive and easy to communicate with.
good,"Safeway is a nice place to work at. The coworkers are great, the customers are great and just the overall atmosphere at Safeway is a pleasant one. It is very fast pace and you have to keep up with the everyday duties of the job, but your coworkers make it the best it can be and everyone just rolls with it and we get things done. This was my first job and I'm glad my first job was at Safeway. I grew a lot as a person and pushed me towards a different career where I can expand and show off my skills that I learned at Safeway."
good,Safeway was able to give me health insurance and give me a steady pay with ways for me to improve on my career and up my pay. I was able to gain different skills and as a courtesy clerk I was able to do air of different things
good,"On a standard day of work, It is always best to go in early and see what the latest news is for the company and check on what is need to be done for the shift such as; inspecting what is needed to get restocked, what items need to be put back in its proper place, checking what needs to be cleaned and more. As well as help the customer with looking for certain items"
good,"Would check to see what needed to be stocked and would prepare what food needed to be made. "
good,"The company is a great environment for collaboration. "
good,"Working at Safeways has been very good, with flexible hours and friendly staff. All of the managers have been very helpful and accommodating and I would not mind staying on here if another job permits."
good,i liked my time at safeway i was on nights there for 10 years and it was a fun place to work most of the time the bosses are nice and the pay is good
good,scanning items the management was pretty friendly but i felt like they walked around thinking there higher then everyone i love the cashier industry remember to send the food down to the bagger i like bagging being a cashier
good,your always working its a high production place. if you like baking and being with a brunch of cool people. the only thing that sucks is the hour if you dont care about working ovenight.
good,Safeway was a great second job. I loved being a barista and my coworkers were nice and always helpful. I recommend shopping at your local Safeway
good,"Wether a day at work what I learned management=directors= ceo=coworkers= hardest part of the job=still does or does not =just my opinion only.$ names I learned to support Metro caring Denver Colorado. wholeistic not just union ,similar the same as king soopers ."
good,"As a manager, I need to be able to work by myself for several hours, be task orientated and able to multitask running the department and my staff. I have to be flexible with staff's needs and wants regarding their work schedules, as well as adding extra 1 on 1 training with staff that struggle with aspects of their job duties"
good,"A typical day at Safeway/Albertsons working in the highly secure data center includes answering phone calls from technicians in Manila Philippines, supporting thousands of stores via telephone support and remote connectivity to routers, switches, firewalls and other various network equipment. Its really busy for the 12-14 hours while I am there constantly learning new things to meet the needs of the company. As 1 person of a 3-4 person Network team supporting the network side for 1 of 2 data centers within the enterprise. Co workers are usually middle aged to senior guys mostly. The hardest part of the job was staying awake. I rode my bike to work so transportation played a part. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting overtime. I enjoyed gaining all the experience that I did but the job can be somewhat draining."
good,"Fast paced work, busy, busy, busy. Have all the tools you need to accomplish your tasks. Have to multi/multi task and stay focused on accomplishing tasks and customer service but doable"
good,"A typical day for me always went by fast, however I was in one of those positions were I didn't have to wait for the customers. Customer service can be annoying, stressful, and difficult in some area's. I learned a lot like what it takes to be truly good at customer service and just going above and beyond the normal. I learned the most from being a helper clerk because I had to make decisions on my own and at times i felt like I was an actual PIC. Management at Safeway from my experience who I worked under was amazing, the best I have ever seen, now however I heard though there are some who are not nearly as good, I know it's just all on the individual them-self. My co-workers were better then a lot in my past, really tried to help as much as they could, some of course didn't but that was like only one or two about of a dozen so it was not that much I ran into that. The hardest part of my job was just how some of the customers were, but that is a give in, besides that only two other things; the first thing is when Safeway and Albertsons joined companies, corporate really started to lower our hours and increase what we need to do. as well as talk about benefits being lowered. The second thing was just some of the things corporate wanted just didn't make much point when they brought it down to us. I know they tried helping, but they only made it harder with there decisions. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people as well as knowing I did what was expected of me and even more."
good,"Picking and stacking products on pallets, preparing pallets for shipment, constant lifting and carrying of product. Prior power jack experience is an asset but not a requirement. Extensive heavy lifting is required."
good,"I really liked the work environment, but I was shocked by how fast things moved in there. I heard from a fellow employee that working in the deli is one of the most intense jobs you can get at a Safeway."
good,I worked for this company for eleven years. It is a very fast paced workplace where hard work is an expectation. It can also be a good time with the other employees. I have developed a lot of close friendships over the years. The benefits are great and there is almost always an opportunity to work overtime.
good,Good place to work great benefits always a chance to further your career a real fun place to work the only reason I left Was because I got offered a job with much higher pay but in all honesty I should have never left
good,"I would stock freight and oreder product for the store. When we would have customers, I would check them out.When there was extra time i would pull out freight from the backroon to rotate dates."
good,The company was a good employer and the management team were clear and fair.  There is ample availability for advancement and the working conditions and culture was good.
good,Bag groceries for customers and assist customers with finding or retrieving items. Respond to all customers requests and giving them what they want. Hardest part of the job is that it is a lot of walking. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping out people all the time.
good,"Overall it was a good work environment, and a positive work expirience. They had plenty to offer and learn, you can pick it up quick and eeasily. So long as you keep common sense and output good work the job security is great."
good,"typical day at work would be stocking shelves at night when i was a night stocker, as a cashier meet new people constantly putting money on gas tanks and playing lottery numbers for customers"
good,"it was decent, not too good, not too bad. I learned a lot in my time there."
good,Our team received excellent training and we proved to be economical  in our purchasing.  We profited each quater with our hard work.  My co-managers were a joy to work with every day.
good,"it fun working with the safeway,staff is qute co operating and inetresting thungs to learn everyday .The payscale was also good,i was able to get time off which i requested for. all in all it was good there"
good,I loved working at safeway meeting members of the public and working on the tills.all the staff were lovely and management listened too you.iloved doing different tasks such has delivering flyers filling shelves and till work a nice enviroment to work in.
good,It was a good company front end managers did not treat workers with respect they deserve. Good benefits with company  Pushing carts helping customers
good,"A typical day at Safeway would be me clocking in, then proceeding to the bakery department to see what was needed. Depending on who worked before me, sometimes I would have to package items for the customers or I will have to begin the set up for the next day. For the most part when I was coming in my manager was leaving. My co-workers were very helpful being willing to do overtime if one needed assistance."
good,"the day starts off by straighting whole dept replacing anything missing .Cut flowers and make arrangements,do the paper work from the day before.The most enjoyable part of the jobs is the people love seeing them smile and feels good to help them make their day brighter"
good,"It's a good job for a high school/college kid. I really like the people, management is a bit up tight and likes to think my life revolves around work. They pay their courtesy clerks pretty badly. One of my co workers gets paid more than me for working the same job that I do. But it's good for getting yourself through college and high school."
good,I loved working for Safeway I wish it would have bin full time not part time. the wages were so so . The management was great to work for .  Safeway was close to my home.
good,"It was interesting place to work for since it was my first time working in retail. I learned how to maintain a store, place orders, build displays, and med sheets."
good,"Only worked this position for a short time then relocated back to the Denver metro area, liked working as front end checker, and produce departments while employed with this company"
good,i enjoyed working there it was a great opportunity to learn and develop my skills as an employee and as a person. nightly task consist of stocking the shelves and pulling all the product forward
good,"A typical day as a cashier would involve:"
good,Working in this environment always gave me an opportunity for improvement. The people were fun to work with and I was able to gain a good amount of experience.
good,The environment while working at Safeway was one of the best environments I had been around. The employees were great it was fun working there. I learned to work well with other as well as communicating with them.
good,Great employees we all work together as a team. If we need help in our department they would pull from other departments.Our customers were great also I would connect with customers on a personal level. I had a lot of regulars.I knew what they wanted before they even ordered anything.
good,"Safeway was a great place for me to learn self disicpline,  always helped me work on my people and commincation skill. I want to continue to grow and develop as a young man."
good,Work was not too bad just not enough room for growth in the company wish I was able to advance further but also a lot faster.It is a fine company and I am blessed to be able to be given that chance to work with them
good,"Typical Day at work:"
good,good fisrt time job experience if needed. they have many positions open and very good customer service experiences. you could make safeway a career job instead of get by job.
good,The best part of my job is without a doubt the people that I work with. Everyone is always ready to help and encourage one another. That has definitely helped me become a more confident person.
good,"In my present job, i learned how to be responsible and extremely reliable. My costumer service skills improved and I connected with my costumers and realized how important it is to engage with every one, so they feel welcome and make them want to come back."
good,"I clean the bathrooms, sweep the floors, take care of the trash around the store, push the carts, and do anything the manager says needs to be done. Everyone gets their job done, and when employees DO need help, I make sure our work is done (I.e. helping Starbucks with their trash so they may keep serving customers, helping the bakery department with cleaning tasks if necessary). It's manually demanding, but I work hard to keep everyone's morale up. The employees all have a story that I love to hear over the time I've worked with them, and we always make each other laugh when were in the break room."
good,"the Safeway in centralia, washington is always busy so management and co-works alike all take pride in keeping the store stocked and in great shape."
good,On a typical day i get to work and start out by trying to put as much produce out before the delivery truck comes in at night around 7. Then once the truck drops off the delivery I start working on it trying to put as much out.
good,"This is one of the places where you can actually grow I wish when i was 16 I stayed here instead of moving onto another job right away the one and only one complaint I have about vons is the uniform I mean slacks, buttoned up and tie was just a little too much for me"
good,Typically the time went fast. Customers were friendly and the work wasn't too hard. Typically there was just a lot to do. With so much to do it made the time go quickly. Coworkers were nice. Hardest part was getting time off. Most enjoyable was creating different drinks that weren't available on the menu.
good,I did enjoy my time working at Safeway. Everyone was very kind and welcoming. They helped me start the job off well and helped me advance at the store. I worked in many different departments where I was able to build my customer service skills and still help out behind the scenes of the store. I was also given the ability to train and supervise other workers who were new or having trouble with their tasks because I became so well rehearsed at most things. My favorite thing about the job was working on the sales floor because I got to talk with and get to know all of the customers whom I usually saw on a weekly basis. The hardest part however was working the morning shifts but after a few days I got used to them pretty quickly.
good,"While working here. I only started at $7.25 and couldn't go any higher than $7.80 upon raises. The union initiation fee was about $230 and I barely made $100 a week, so it was a little bit difficult to come up with that money."
good,Was a great work.place. I stopped working there because I was concerned about my baby was having some issues with my babies health problems.But I did enjoy my job
good,I learned a lot working here. I obtained many different skills especially people skills and working with a many different people. The job was never too difficult but of course it had its challenges. Management was excellent other than the fact that you couldn't gain more hours on your schedule.
good,"My local Safeway is a smaller store compared to others in the area, but had a very big presence in the neighborhood. Everyone in the area knew all the employees by name and all the employees knew all the locals that frequented the store.I am glad I was able to be part of the team. I have been in the sales and retail business since 1987 doing various jobs, but working at this store made me feel like I was actually part of something. I really enjoyed working with my Manager and coworkers. I felt like I was helping my friends run the business as best as we can, as opposed to only feeling like I am just at work. I am hoping my next adventure in life will bring me to a job where I can feel like I'm part of the community."
good,A typical shift is 9 hrs with a one lunch break. Friendly coworkers. There is always some level of management own hand at all times. very high expectations of employees.  Paid biweekly.

I get along with the employers. Everyone was amicable."

good,"A day working as a courtesy clerk at Safeway would usually start with helping customers bag their groceries. If it was really busy i would be outside collecting carts to return to the front of the store. If the day was a bit slow I would do a sweep log, which is walking around the store, making sure it was clean to ensure the safety and satisfaction of customers. I learned how to speak to customers very well and quickly problem solve. My co-workers and management are always very helpful when ever I have a question or need help assisting a customer. The hardest part about working at Safeway would have been memorizing items and what aisle they were in. The most enjoyable part is meeting and speaking to customers."

Management was very professional and an excellent mentor. My co-workers were task oriented and often cross trained, making it easy to help one another easily.

I'm friendly, compassionate, ambitious but above all else I'm a leader. I never give up and I'm always determined to get my work done the hardest part of working at Safeway would be closing because of the many duties I was in charge of completing before the end of my shift.

The hardest part of the job is usually when we run out of a product that people want because I am not able to give them what they want and I have no control over that. The most rewarding part of the job is getting to help people find new, interesting flavors and provide excellent customer service that makes them want to come back."

good,"Working on the graveyard shift, there is little to no traffic to get the shelves stocked neatly and quickly. The timing of  completion of the workload each night, determined what time you get off, or how easy the night was going to be. Working with a small team, it was easy to keep good morale prevalent on the floor. As you start to master certain departments, you then can learn the other departments and occasionally help out in order to obtain more hours. I not only did night stocking, I also cashiered sometimes at night, sometimes in the day, I worked in the floral department during busy seasons such as graduation, and valentines day. I worked in the frozen foods department and always was available for anything new. The hardest part of the job was dealing with shoplifters late at night, and the uncertainty of confrontation, safety is important for any job and my store had a security guard until midnight some nights and 2 am some nights.

good,Creative team and ever changing workplace.  Management is performance driven and strives for optimizing the customer experience.  Work is interesting and finance teams are respected.
good,"Typically, my routine as the Person in Charge when I clocked in, I got together with the manager in charge. He/she would give me a little list of duties to complete over the course of my shift. My shift normally consisted of completing store walks to check in on the departments, as well as the floor clerks who were assigned to clean the store. During rush hour, I assisted the front end cashiers in order to make sure that customers came in and out without having to wait a long time. Besides that, I stocked the essential parts of the store such as the milk and eggs in the dairy department. Occasionally, I helped produce, the bakery, the freezer but my main focus was the grocery portion of the store. Being in management I learned that no matter how hard you try you cant always make everyone happy. My biggest challenge was managing a store of employees who watched me start off as a clerk and eventually became their boss. Most employees conformed and accepted me as their boss. Others weren't as cooperative as I would've liked but it brought in a dynamic to my work life. Aside from that, the most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers. Receiving compliments from them about how much my help meant to them and how they were happy I was around to assist. I can proudly say that I satisfied 8/10 customers that had complaints or negative feedback or some kind of issue. I tried to help them as best as I could, so therefore I gained a loyal client base. I had my regular customers who would come in and say hi every time they shopped. They knew who I was, being recognized by the people"
good,"Starting at Safeway in 1980 as a 16 yr old I thought I died and went to heaven as that time working for Safeway was akin to working at the Pulp Mill in that the wages were very very lucrative. I started from the bottom and moved my way to close to the top as a 1st assistant manager with stops in West Vancouver, Richmond, Abbotsford, Chilliwack and finally South Delta."
good,"In a typical work day at my job there is a menagerie of tasks! It is all about filling our customers needs! Whether it just filling a simple prescription in a fast and efficient manner or calling insurance companies and doctors offices to get a prescriptions approve for our customers! Most everyone that works in Safeway pharmacies cares about the people they serve! That is what Safeway is all about! I would say that I have one of the best pharmacist managers! The hardest part is keeping all the balls rolling and completing all tasks at hand! Everything is important! The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I serve, the customers."
good,A completely doable job that is willing to work with your schedule and needs but may have conflicts with coworkers based on their attitudes or eagerness to help.
good,"Daily tasks in the pharmacy involved thorough knowledge of computerized drug-distribution systems, drug-utilization evaluation, emerging medications, inventory management and regulations governing pharmacy services.  It is also important for pharmacist to serve as an effective liaison between the healthcare team and the community to improve drug usage and therapeutic outcomes."

good,Worked at the Safeway in Los Altos before the remodeling. Management was cool. small simple job. nothing bad i could say.
good,"A typical day at works starts with clocking in ,and checking in with management.

Everyday i would be able to learn how to improve myself in working on the check stand,putting up stock such as remembering produce codes or to better help customers, and being able to face alse. Their really is not a hard part of the job once you learn how to order product ,and see what people like to but at a grocery store it is not hard to thing of what someone may buy even on a busy day;when a product is on sale."

good,Safeway is a good place to work because you can always get raises and move up in the company.

good,The most enjoyable part of my work day is interacting with customers and management.
good,"A typical day was almost always hectic. You had to be quick, have patience, stay positive, be team goal oriented. I got along with everyone to keep a drama free working environment. Hardest part of my job was not being valued enough for as much effort as I put into the company, and having to deal with unpleasant customers with a smile. Most enjoyable part of working for any of the companies or Job titles was, making someones day. I very much enjoyed being personable with customers and keeping my environment pleasant and positive. I learned you can't please everyone, but you can try your hardest to do what you can, that's all anyone can really ask for."

good,busy and fast pace. learn to operate cash register and handle larger amount of money
good,Safeway is a great place to work. The pay here is good for the location. I would not want to turn it into a career though. I am only working here while in search of a real career. The managers are very relaxed and easy going. It is definitely an interesting group of people to be surrounded by on a daily basis. The most difficult part of my job is working under pressure. There is always a million things to accomplish and not enough time which make time management and efficiency very important skills in the job.
good,"-Union Dues Required"
good,I loved working at this place. It was my first job and it was an amazing opportunity. Everyone was so sweet and nice.
good,I enjoyed being able to help customers. I had a great team to work with.
good,i was a cashier  for a little bit. help people help my team were my duties. Friendly every day to costumer was my principles.
good,"I worked with the company for almost 8 years. As a salaried employee, my work day was a minimum of 10 hours, regularly eclipsing 12+ hours. The long hours do/did make it tough to maintain a healthy home life. The grocery industry is powerful and always in high demand, providing amazing job security to hard workers."

good,"The colleagues and managements are nice, easy communication."
good,"Typically I would oversee the daily operations of the store.  Direct and coach employees in their duties and help them solve problems.  Help customers with issues to their complete satisfaction.  The management team was wonderful, always willing to teach me new tasks so that I may continue learning and advance.  My coworkers were fun, upbeat and honest.  I enjoyed working with all the different personalities."
good,Management and employees must communicate to provide the best service and product to their customers.
good,"Working at Safeway in the Deli department was interesting. The work was challenging and constantly kept me busy, which is what i enjoy. The two downsides were the fact that the shift assignments were unpredictable, and could change daily, and that the training was not nearly up to the task of preparing an employee for this position if the supervisor is less helpful than the other co-workers. It taught me many things though through experience, including, but not limited to, how to properly slice meat with a meat slicer, how to prepare sub sandwiches, how to fry many foods, how to efficiently serve food to customers, and much more. The most enjoyable part was indeed my co-workers. They were always friendly and helpful. Not to mention patient when i asked them questions when i first started."

good,"relaxed culture, fun co workers, lots of opportunities, fast pace and tight dedlines"
good,"Very creative and process oriented."
good,"I learned how to talk to customers and make them satisfied."
good,Well I learned a lot from the deli and realized how much it is a tough job. I managed my best at my duties but it drained me of all my energy. Another thing is the hours didn't work for me and it wasn't steady and always varied which is why the job didn't work for me.
good,Working at safeway was interesting. I got to meet a lot of nice people. Co-workers were great. Starting out as a courtesy clerk you have to deal with a lot of lifting and some janitorial jobs. The hardest part is if you work in a place that gets snow- pushing in carts can be a hassle. I enjoyed see the friends i have made and they made working at Safeway fun.
good,"serving customers and handling cash."
good,"I work in the Safeway Pharmacy Health and Wellness Group. The group has exceptional leadership with great vision and interaction with all levels of the team."
good,"Work is fast-paced and constant. As with any job, you get nice customers as well as difficult ones. The employees that I work with are awesome people and it helps make time pass quickly. The pay is VERY low compared to the amount of work required. It is relatively easy to advance in the company, however the pay doesn't advance with you. I learned four departments in the first couple of months working there."
good,"A typical day is   talking to the customs getting a idea of the different meats they like ,management ok."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of quick pace and steady costumer service. Remaining focused and at the same time still having a good time with my co-workers. I learned a lot about people in general. I was able to interact with people of all realms and learned how to be more diverst when it came to things in my personal life, I'll honestly say we went through quite a few managers in my duration of being employed at Vons and not all of them were the nicest, but i always would remain professional and positive with those who weren't and was very appreciative of the ones who were kind. I had a great time with each and every one of my co-workers. It wasnt like just being at work, it was a family unit that we all developed with one another and it helped us all work together in a positive way. I'll say the hardest part of my job was when we were limited on staff memebers and it would be really busy. We would complete each task around and outside of the store to the best of our capabilities but it was not as easy as it usually was when we had the right amount of staff members present. I have a few most enjoyable parts of this job and the first one was meeting the criteria it was that coorporate expected. All that took was everyone putting their best foot forward and being 100%. With that came along raises, more hours and parties for our store. Another most enjoyable part of this job was delivering great costumer service and making the costumer's experience a great one."
good,The company culture is great! Many opportunities to be promoted within and recognized for your hard work and achievements. A fast paced and growing company which great to start off your career! Management is there for you every step of the way in coaching and helping you with anything you need. Meeting new people and talking/managing clients everyday is the best part of the job. There is a lot of freedom and ways to show improvement and your skills.
good,"Great company to work for just looking for more hours."
good,"The culture is good, and getting better. Good work/life balance and I believe in the current leadership's ability to do great things in the years to come."
good,"Providing outstanding customer services"
good,serving different kind of customers in purchasing their goods.
good,Its a local grocery store I had my regulars and in floral I had my regulars.
good,"As a bakery clerk I did not handle transactions, so most of my customer interactions involved locating products for them or answering questions about products. Customer service for this job is very important and every month a mystery shopper will show up to evaluate you. Either I was packaging items all day or slicing bread all day, depending on the shift. My co-workers were very involved and the hours went by quickly but beware there is lots and lots of standing. The average starting wage was around $10-$11 hourly for part-time but you earn raises after working a certain amount of hours."
good,"During the Safeway Grand Re-Opening, I would set up my stand and offer samples to customers walking around the store. I would stand for 6 hours at a time, and take a half hour break before going back. The hardest part of the job was standing for so long and the most enjoyable part was getting paid well."
good,A very enjoyable independent work environment that allows the flexibility to work at your own pace. Although the start time is very early the management and coworkers are fun loving and very easy to get along with.
good,"Each day varies by customer volume. The team's goals are primarily safety, speed and quality customer service. Overall, I learned to be aware of human errors, be a cautious driver and keeping procedures consistent. Occasionally, both drivers & management offer advice to to ease tough situations. A typical day consists of loading ambient & refrigerated totes safely onto the trucks, performing vehicle maintenance reports, informing management of any faulty issues, drive safely to customer's address, maneuver & deliver safely into customer's home, and reviewing the receipt with the customer. The hardest part would have to be learning to accept angry customers but with patience and composure, the result is good customer service. The most enjoyable part is the interaction of diverse customers."
good,working for Safeway was nice co workers were great. I liked seeing the customers happy. I learned how to talked to strangers without the fear of what to say.
good,"Regular work experience to be expected from a large scale grocery store, but the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Unfortunately not much room for advancement due to the many older staff members, but that tends to improve in the summer."

good,"A normal day at work, is cleanig, customer service, dishes, serving and making sandwiches/plates/cooking."
good,"The typical day at work in Safeway, is enjoyable, checking people out, chatting with them about different subject, such as sports, cooking, their daily routine. I learn more about people when I try to have a conversation about something and listen to their opinion."
good,"Start at 8am work hard off at 4:30pm"
good,"Starting off my day with helping customers,baking and cleaning."
good,"I check out people in the checkstand and bag their groceries. I also assist customers when they need a certain product or would like to voice their opinion about the store. I also tag and stock shelves when necessary and maintain a clean work area. I have learned through this job that customers always come first. I also have learned to get along with co-workers in a professional environment. The management is always at work ready to help cashiers in any situation they may have and are always willing to jump into the job and help the cashiers out. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing and talking to my frequent customers. You get to meet a variety of people when you check out their groceries. The hardest part of the job is to assist all customers. Sometimes the customers are rude and you want to yell at them. However, you must be professional at all times and treat the customer with respect."
good,Position provides customer service for all customers  in the meat department. Paid weekly!
good,"I am happy to say that Safeway is the first company I have worked for which required good work and a positive outlook from each of it's employees. The only unfortunate experience with this company was the interesting quality of employees which I worked with in the deli section."
good,has a huge variety of product to choose from they are always very friendly and willing to help you find whatever you need and answer any questions you may have.
good,"Love my job here it’s great,  the main objective is customer service if your hard working and good with people this is great job very flexible with hours they just don’t offer competitive pay."
good,enjoyed working for safe. they give discount for being partly employed. only work partime
good,"I would cook, clean, stock, do loads, manage people. I make sure that my co workers do everything the right way and get what we all need done as a team. There was know hard part about being a manager for Safeway. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know people."
good,My day at work consisted of working as a cashier. I got to help people find the products they were looking for and ring their grocery's up. I learned the meaning of patience. Management was excellent very in order and was very on top of things. The coworkers were a huge family and always was their for one another from covering shifts or helping one another in different ways. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the people i did and helping the customers.
good,has a lot of good employees that work for the company everyone is very helpful and energetic.
good,Worked there when yonger for five years and came back for five years. nice people to work with.
good,"good place t work when I was 16 and given my 1st real break."
good,"A typical day at work required wearing multiple hats. I learned a lot about commercial real estate, leasing and sub-leasing of properties. I also learned how to multi task. The most enjoyable part of the job was I met a lot of people from different ethnic groups. The hardest part of the job was not enough hours in the day to accomplish everything,"
good,Had some enjoyable and fun times and also worked with a strong team. And helped me build my skills at an early age
good,"A regular day at work is basically handling all the in the store. Most of the paperwork, western union, money orders and customer service. The management good but could be better. I think the hardest part of my job will b if there money missing trying to figure out where it went. Most of the time it always comes back. "
good,Not a bad place to work if you come in with great work ethics. There were always room for advancement
good,"Customer service focused, friendly values, organised, Opportunity to develope also part time opportunities."

good,Learned how to cook better..Be better with customers.Learned bout this fishes
good,operating cash register and assisting customers looking for food ringing up groceries handling returns and printing out money orders and giving change and counting all of the registers before closing the store
good,"A typical day at work as a baker during the day would first off be going out on the floor and taking an inventory list just to see what needs to be baked that day. I make a list and usually start with all the bread items that would need to be proof, since it takes the longest. Bake all items on the list. I also would work all shifts not only the baking one, I would mix breads like french, sourdough, italian, etc. Starting from nothing but a bag of flour. I know how to operate bakery machines and mixers. After mixing dough I would cut the dough and fly it into a roller which makes the dough come out as a loft. I would also work the customer service shift, which includes operating the cash register, assisting customers with any questions or orders, pack and tag all items that bakers bake, Another shift I would work which is the shift I enjoyed the most the over night shift which includes proofing and frying of donuts and baking the morning break out. I've learned a lot at this company, I had no previous work history before Safeway. This company thought me everything I needed to know about being a baker. Management wise there was some ups and downs due to the fact a lot of managers were getting sent away and different ones were getting sent in, which made it hard to create a bond with. The hardest part off all shifts would have to be time management everything has an exact time, I had know problems meeting any time limits but at times it did get a little overwhelming. "
good,"A typical day is very relaxing. Nobody is breathing down my neck and hollering at me. I learned communication skills, how to operate a cash register, a pallet jack both standard and powered, facing/stocking shelves. Management changed a few times in my 2 and half years at the 1076 store. Overall management was good and understanding when I had to take leave after a death in the family. They show true concern for their employees. The hardest part of the job with out a doubt was learning all the different produce codes and properly handling WIC vouchers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co-workers. I still talk to them from time to time.  "
good,"i would cash checks, money orders, and also account for tills. i signed off for the garda money transfers also dealt with any complaints of any customer"
good,Cashier making sure every purchased is made and keeping area organized
good,If you are good at customer service then this is the place to work.
good,"My typical day consisted of restocking products. I didnt learn much here, I did not work here long, and I essentially just stocked shelves.. "
good,"great place to work"
good,i would bag groceries and provide customer service my managers were really great the hardest part about my job was bailing boxes the most enjoyable part was i had an hour break
good,"Produce manager  for a large store at that time in Las Vegas."
good,"making sure stock was on the shelves"
good,"You learn from your mistakes and you obviously grow from them to become a more proficient and responsible worker. The employees were tolerable, some more than others. I enjoyed my time there and had fun working with such interesting people. Along the way I gained new stories to tell and new skills that I will take with me to every job."
good,I liked working for safeway everyone is helpful n nice to me when I work there.
good,"Safeway has been a enjoyable place to work, with a diverse set of employees and a relaxed atmosphere.  There is a mix of staff that has either been with the company for many years, or a ever rotating student population looking for a great part-time job.  This job is purely customer service, which can be both the best and worst part of the job.  "
good,Everyone was helpful when I was an employee.  I was stalking as well as pulling product out of the trucks and putting empty milk crates back in the trucks.  Made sure that everything was nice and neat as well as organized in the back.  Had to bag the customers groceries when needed.
good,"I learned so much during my time at Safeway, I enjoyed working my team, And all the customers were great."
good,I found it really hard to adjust to all the different time frames to be at work and when I got off. Some days you did not know what day it was.
good,everyday something new needs to be get done and needs to be daily and be outspoken and do it
good,"very busy as time goes fast, employee camaraderie. Learned people skills. The hardest part of the job was kneelling, bending and crawling. The most enjoyable part of the job is job security."
good,"Safeway was a fast job, you always had something to do upon arrival. The hours were always fair depending on what you wanted to work, and the management works really hard in order to make sure the employees are performing their jobs accordingly"
good,Typical day at work is starting the day with checking emails and dealing with high priority issues. 
good,"Courtesy clerks assist in the quick and efficient checkout service of our customers. They conduct price checks, take “return” products back to proper shelf locations, and help maintain store shelves by cleaning and fronting products. They also gather shopping carts from parking lots, sweep and mop floors, assist in the prompt clean up of spills and other general housekeeping duties. "
good,"it is a good company to work for, really treatsd people well."
good,"A typical day could include preparing and cutting vegetables, putting stock out on the floor, helping customers and other miscellaneous jobs."
good,"Safeway IT service desk is a very fast paced and demanding the moment you step on the floor. The IT service desk is a call center and is a help desk for all Safeway Grocery stores. You're on the phone for the whole 8 hours with exceptions of break and lunches. Your expected to resolve all issues 75% of the time. This not hard because most issues that come to the IT service desk are mostly user error or lack of training, which on of the downfalls of Safeway. Safeway's technology is dated and runs on legacy hardware and software, which is not hard to learn. Management has changed every year, so your stuck with new policies changes every time you turn your head."
good,my usual day at work is very fast paced and busy. There is a usual list of duties to be completed on a daily basis. Management is okay but there is also very little opportunity for advancement and the starting wages barely increase over time.
good,open the store or close the store
good,Great place to work as an intern pharmacist with flexible hours and an awesome staff!
good,My first job was as a courtesy clerk i was taking under the wings by employs and management so the inviroment was more so like family. There weren't too many typical days at a grocier store but the hardest thing about my job i would say is pleasing the costumers. I learned how to multi-task
good,A typical day at work was fun and proactive. I learned a lot about the company and how to operate diffrent machines. The management was great. My co-workers was great also. The hardest part of my job was so much heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the friendly customers
good,"This job was where my multi tasking skills really shined,and where i got toexercise my strong customer service ability."
good,Was a great first job. And I learned so much within that year. It was great. They do have it's ups and downs. But for the most part I enjoyed it.
good,Typical work day was in the office at 6 am. Wonderful staff reporting to my position. Many goals and objectives for Safeway including enhanced programs and cost reductions. The most enjoyable part of this job was enhancing company performance.
good,"Great atmosphere, people and hours! I enjoyed stocking, prepping, and helping customers. Learning all aspects of how to run the deli was the most rewarding. Sanitation, prepping, catering, stocking, inventory and rotation are some of the few things I learned. I enjoyed my friendly co-workers and management team."
good,I enjoyed helping customer. Keeping the store clean and organized. Also helping customer out to there cars.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was fast paced and the shifts went by quickly. I liked talking to and serving the customers and being able to make them smile. I learned customer service and enjoyed my job, the only thing i disliked was when they cut my hours to employ new hires and i was only receiving 9 hours in a 2 week period."
good,Pooductive and gun workplace and with a friendly enviroment
good,I have learned to be even more self motivated and proficient with this position. I always look for more challenges and more departments to which I can learn and assist. The training isn't always provided so progress is taken on at the individual level.
good,"It was a good place to work. It was just time for a change. I did alot of different things for Safeway. I was the front end manager. Taught courtesy clerks about there jobs, I worked in video,rented movies. Handled western union transactions,I was also night manager where you you prepared the store for tne next days business. Cashed up all the money each day for awhile. There were very little things that i did not know or perform for Safeway. It was just a time for a career change"
good,easy going no trouble
good,I only had Safeway as a summer job but I did enjoy it. Management was good. It was good to be scheduled around school as well.
good,"a high school first job,i bagged groceries,swept floors ,,cleaned restrooms,was under paid,most enjoyable part was dealing with customers."
good,"Safeway was a good place to work friendly people, staff and managment."
good,"Working at safeway was the best move i did. They gave me a chance at managment, and i really enjoyed it. I learned so much from it.The people there were so nice to me. They took me right in and showed me everything i needed to know. I could ask any question and they would answer it for me.I would do it again if i could. The hardest part of my job was the some of the employees and doing displine. The best part was the customers and the employees."
good,At safeway i was able to become the stocker i am now. Ive learned how to take on more responsibilities from being able to lead a night crew of 6 or more to taking over for the grocery manager and running my own department. Management was pretty good ive always gotten along well with every manager i had and was always recognized for my hard work. The thing i loved most was being able to make my upper management always proud.
good,"Take it day by day. Need to be able to adapt to change, every work day is different because there is no consistency in customer based revenue."

I have learned a lot of great things from all my co-workers and continue to learn as my time goes on."
good,"A typical day for me could be anything as i often am required to help other deptments out,"
good,management was caring and the employees I worked with were like family.
good,"A typical day at work was very moderate, things ofcourse pick up at lunch and after 5 pm. I learned to quickly manuever and multitask. Listening and giving every customer your undevided attention is key to handling a heavy work load. Definately an enviroment full of team players. The hardest part of the job was leaving becuase I had become so comfortable with my co workers, managers and postion and duties. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours where business peaked, you always had something to do, I loved it!"
good,"The managerial staff at Safeway is very motivated in making the customers happy and creating an environment that is enjoyable for everyone. With understanding supervisors, we are able to take time off that is needed and can have a good working relationship."
good,"Either working at the service desk, stocking, checkstand, cart gathering, or, assisting at the location's gas station. It added to my overall retail and customer service experience, along with more product knowledge indicative of the grocery industry, major cash handling and WesterUnion processing. Management was competent and fair, for the most part. The co workers were highly diverse and basically great to know and work with. Balancing duties during busy times and high expectations regarding knowledge of certain operations, such as 'how to order a cake', 'specific of a product that I was not familiar with', along with other minor issues. I just liked it there for the six months I worked there and it was a good place to work. No regrets."
good,"I learned how to run the cashier, and handle money. I became friends with my employees. I enjoyed meeting new people who came thru my till, and told me about there day. I had awesome co-workers, they were nice and fun to talk to."
good,"I was there for 12 years and it was a great company to work for. I wanted to try better things and move to another city. The managers where good, my coworks were the best. I had and maid great customer service skills."
good,"Typical day is dealing with customers that may have an issue with a policy in store, issue online with online delivery or the Safeway online coupon site."
good,"I love working there but need some thing for what i went to school for. ""MEDICAL ASSISTANT"""
good,"A typical day for me would be, me arriving at work and working the cash register. interacting with my customers. If for some reason it was slow, i would stock shelves or clean my check stand."
good,The club card savings was the best thing that happened! Management was very nice and still is!
good,"Working with different attitudes, cash handling, as well as training as assistant manager. My coworkers was fun and easy to get along with. The easiest part was the time flying cause there's always something to do. There wasn't anything hard about this job to me. The most enjoyable part was seeing my customers leave with a smile!"
good,Safeway is a great company to work for. They are willing to work with you on schedules and are always open to new suggestions and ideas from employees. Great opportunity for advancement. Safeway always recruits from inside.
good,Very flexible in their scheduling because of how many high school kids they hire. Management at my store was top notch. Co-workers were fun to work with.

good,This was a fairly challenging but fun job. i enjoyed working here.
good,"Lets see, Safeway was the easiest job. The day I started I got promoted 3 xs in the first month. San Jose store was great, worked there for 2 yrs. (mother became ill had to leave) started work in Mt View store, the first boss was great she was fun but did her job strongly. I was glad to be her back up. We went through a-lot of bosses there young ones and ones that didn't like our skin color. I was a GM manager at this last time."
good,"Greeting customers, scanning their groceries, special requests handled for the customers, and taking payment for their purchases!"
good,"Learned not to trust my employees. At least not all of them. Management either would not or could not hire more people to help so I worked with maybe one other person from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm on 6 out of seven days. Only two people were cross-trained to help from other departments and they were not always around to cover. On occasion, a new employee would be brought to the kiosk for training with no knowledge of US currency or the ability to speak or understand English. This was not fair to the employee, the customer or to me. Complaints were off the charts because of not having help. Became fond of this job even though there were problems with staffing. Customers were great. Product was enough to brag about."
good,"A typical day at work for me is going to work and doing what instructions are provided for me the by the department manager that day. No matter how busy the store is and how tough it is for us to work, we still manage to get everything we need done. The store managers are friendly and easy to talk to but, some of them micromanage and won't let you just do your work. The hardest part of the job is on holidays when the store is extremely busy and everyone is trying their hardest to keep up with customer satisfaction needs. The part I enjoy the most is knowing that us a employees and keep and open relationship with our customers knowing their satisfied every time they shop at our store."
good,Hard working people great company to work with and for. would work there again anytime.
good,"very high stress environment, not a stable work schedule, cant plan ahead for anything because time off is not guaranteed untill the schedule comes out which is weekly. I liked the fact that I had job security and benefits and the protection of a union but there was other things that where not satisfactory about the job."
good,"I enjoy any place I work for, I always learn new things everywhere that's important to me!"
good,"Helping customers with their groceries. I learned to keep customers needs first, learned the right way to make their shopping experience easy. Co-workers were all very helpful. The hardest part was standing on your feet for 8 hours. the most enjoyable part was meeting new customers and getting to know the regulars"
good,Typical Day in Safeway is always busy with people wanting to get or try new items etc.
good,a typical day consisted of assisting with total store functions
good,Positively easy and a handful of helpful co- workers to rely on.
good,"Safeway is a company dedicated to the consumer's shopping experience, and the employees ability to perform specialized tasks. A typical day for my department is to management lease and owned stores accounting via lease analysis and accounting FASB guidelines. Safeway has developed a diverse culture, and is now expounding on Green matters for the company and communities. The co-workers in various departments have fun while they work very hard. Collaboration is centralized instead of decentralized, and the structure is tall; so some communication comes slowly which would be the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is it is never boring."
good,Great place to work
good,"Hours are good, and there was room for advancement when I worked there, but I last worked there before the recession of 2008. I can't say if it is the same way now."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company because you had a chance to advance really quickly
good,I enjoyed the competitiveness in working for a promotion and scoring 10 out of 10 on the mystery shops. The co-workers were friendly and outgoing which made all the difference while I was at work.
good,"Had a great time working for this company, had random lunch events (pizza, doughnuts, BBQ's) huge mixture of nationality, amazing salary + bonus's, very well managed, never been in an accident once while working for this company. They even had reciept draws to pay for your weeks groceries! though i did not enjoy the 4 months of 12 hour days of mandatory overtime, and hour long bus ride to work."
good,"Safeway was an excellent place to work, all of the other employees were friendly and helpful. This was my first job and they helped me get to know the ropes, without treating me as if I were a lesser employee."
good,"When i work at Safeway, most nights i was working with people who didn't do their jobs right. I was doing two to three peoples jobs a night. Its not a good place to work."
good,I gave my all to this company and eventually the hours got dropped to where I couldn't afford my bills so I needed to find another job to be able to take care of my responsibilities
good,Safeway is a great place to work with a strong management team and many  associates that been there were 30 plus yrs.although full time is almost impossible to get .
good,"Great first job, could be stressful at times but nothing that would follow me home and was often easily/quickly reconciled.  Very flexible hours while I was in school and good choice in employees, I've stayed in contact with most of them."
good,"Great place to work, staff and management was great. Hard to get full time hours, so most people are part time and have to pick up shifts when they can, get small weekly pay checks."
good,"As a current College Student, Safeway has been very flexible around my schedule and availability. Only a few times do I run into a scheduling/availability conflict."
good,Salary is not enough to live on if you're part time but the experience of learning customer service and the friendships make it worth it! I enjoy working in the different departments and seeing how the store runs too.
good,Good fair store to work for  management us nice hardworking and will train if your willing to work...... fastpaste  and out gong lady willing to learn anything
good,"I have worked for Safeway for 18 years and I have enjoyed all of it, until the takeover by Albertsons. They changed many things and were more interested in saving money than loyal people.  Even the customers noticed."
good,Great place to work. Great benefits. Great culture. Advancement opportunities. Fair wages. Management a bit out of touch with day to day operations. Would probably work there again if I didn’t have a job I love.
good,I enjoy working here. Have had many opportunities for advancement. Greatly enjoy working with my food service team to assist customers with all their deli needs.
good,"Safeway was once a coveted job, but now the hiring process lacks quality people.   The pay is very low and managements expectations are the same as years ago.   Over worked and under payed."
good,Started as a clerk moved up in my position less than 2 years been with the company almost 10 years they have alot of benefits to offer will proudly recommend
good,"Overall I liked working at Safeway, partly because I had a good manager who was helpful.  You have to be flexible as you only know your work schedule a week in advance.  Some of workers were negative so I worked to keep a positive attitude. But most of the employees at the store I worked at were helpful and worked together well."
good,"Greeted customers and directed to requested product; Cut and prepared seafood for sale; Packaged fresh sea food"
good,people had a great sense of humor and were kind. they also had good work ethic and were accountable for themselves making everything run smoothly. customers seemed to like me and the service I gave them.
good,"it was a good learning curve, for me advanced as far as I could go  its a very stable company. Its very good starting job for kids..meat dept is a physical hard job."
good,"I worked here as a cake decorator and when you do a great job, customers always leave with a smile. You can really get to know someone's personality when they ask you for a specific style of cake. I enjoyed getting to see everyone smile and buy the display cakes."
good,"Safeway taught me how to go out and reach towards people by "
good,I enjoyed working there except working in the bakery department my day started extremely early & working weekends & holidays meant it was not very compatible with a family life.
good,"Operated cash register, prepare food orders, courteous customer service and maintained deli cleanliness. Responsible for assisting customers with information and purchases"
good,"If you new to any city, then Safeway is a good enough place as any to start. Most of the people are friendly and it's a good environment overall. I do have to say that it can be stressful at times and people are often rude to you if there is a language barrier."
good,Overall a good place to work. Could be a little more organized than it is currently. Other than that I enjoyed my time there. The fellow workers were both professional and friendly.
good,"It was a pleasant environment to work in, I met a lot of lovely people while I worked there. The hours were good and the work was consistent and the pay was good."
good,"Pretty good job, mostly polite customers, as well as polite coworkers. Occasionally worked overtime to meet expectations, or above and beyond. Just expect to move a lot."
good,It was a fun experience with a great chance to make good friends. Many people love the work atmosphere and so do I. More people should shop at Safeway in my opinion.
good,"Fast Paced Job and is overwhelming busy during the summer due to being the only Starbucks. Because being so far out in the middle of no where sometimes our shipment would be late and sometimes had issues with getting employees. Working for Safeway was good, I enjoyed my employees (that suck around) and getting to know my customers. People came from all over the world to see our beautiful town and sites around."
good,worked there 3 years they pay well and u get alot of hours if u want them but its hard fast work ..... . . .... . . ... ... . ..... .. . ..... . . .. .. .. . .. . .. . . . .
good,"I was very excited during the hiring process at Safeway. I thought the training process was very extensive and fully prepared me for my position."
good,"Working as a courtesy clerk, I had a lot of tasks that I would be assigned and sometimes unexpected assignments as well i.e. a spill in the aisle.  If these tasks were too overwhelming I could ask for help and receive it, because the staff and coworkers at Safeway made me feel like I could ask for help when I needed it."
good,A typical day at work was going in and collecting carts or in the bakery or doing donuts at 2 am. I learned how to decorate cakes and bake other things and ringing things up on the register. Management was good. Workplace Culture fast pace and very busy. Hardest part was learning how do decorate cakes and collecting cart in the middle of the summer in AZ. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"Safeway had been good to me for twenty years. I was in management for most of those years and the different stores I worked at were each well-managed by the store manager him/herself. In management it seemed the main thing to do was put out little ""fires"" that occurred throughout the store and making sure that customers were well taken care of."
good,"If you don't mind working around people and are a team player,then Safeway is a good company to work for.Especially if it's your first job. The only downfall I would say is,sometimes hours get cut or you could work a whole lot of hours."
good,"This organization has a long-standing reputation of providing goods and services that are easily affordable and readily available. "
good,I started my day as someone who put all the baked goods away.I cut all the bread to go into bags.put all the doughtnuts away and then the bagels. I woulkd help the customers to pick ouy what the wanted.  Sometime I wrote messages on the cake.I always made sure the bakery was neat and clean. the hardest part of my job wasmaking sure all the items were out at the right time
good,"Safeway is a company you should work for if you are looking to be  apart of a team, and want to be able to keep yourself busy. There is always something to do, and you become quite hands on with Lottery, cigarettes, and gas prices when you work in the gas bar. It's always good to keep busy with cleaning, stocking product, counting, and selling goods and services."
good,Working my way up at Safeway took some time but in the end the hourly wage and benefits from the union made it worth my time spent there. The turn over rate was pretty high in some department but the application rate was also pretty high
good,"for a young teen starting off at Safeway it is a good part-time only job. As an adult it is a good starters job, but long term living on your own it will not pay the bills."
good,Very relaxed place to work as long as you did your job correctly and showed up on time. Managers were very kind and understanding and always helped with any problems we had.
good,"The hardest position you can get from Safeway is being a Courtesy Clerk once you've been promoted positions , well in my opinion it gets better. The most enjoyable part is getting payed weekly."
good,"Busy all day."
good,We had great benefits and the employees were like family.  I don't miss the constant movement and everything always changing but overall it was a great job.
good,Good luck getting hours you've requested or that raise you've requested because you will be waiting for months to see a change. Management is unorganized and cares more about the business itself rather than the employees that help the store succeed.
good,"If working with the general public is not for you then I don't suggest this job. There are opportunities for career advancement and great benefits and raises for those who are promoted. Fun environment depending on management. However, schedules are not set and change often."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of an early start with a consistent workflow throughout the day. I learned to work hard and work well, as the work I did greatly affected how the store would be judged by the health inspector. The management was wonderful. They worked with me and my schedule and never over scheduled me, as they were very understanding that I was a college student on his first summer off of school. The workplace culture wasn't the best, but there were a few coworkers that made work a little bit better each day. The hardest part of the job would have to be getting down on my hands and knees to clean the drains if they ever got clogged, and the most enjoyable part would have to be the fact that I was able to converse with my coworkers as I worked."
good,I enjoyed working for Safeway for the most part. I was technically a courtesy clerk but I was being cross-trained to work in the deli and bakery as well. I also helped cashier when they were busy. Most of the managers were easy to work for and the environment was fairly pleasant. The customers were friendly for the most part. I just had one manager that expected the impossible out of me. She even told me to just clock my sweeps when I'm supposed to regardless of whether I was actually able to complete the task. I was not willing nor did I falsify my sweeps. We were often understaffed and I was stuck up on the frontline bagging groceries because I was the only courtesy clerk. I reported this to the union to protect myself in case I got in trouble later on.
good,I liked working there it was a very nice up beat place to work everyone there was nice to work with I felt very comfortable working there and with everyone
good,"Is worked at the call center, where we had inbound calls and also outbound call to other stores. Also worked with credit card paylments.  People here were nice to work with."
good,"Everyday was different. Some days were harder than others, but most days were great! What makes a great team is a greater leader! With the right management inline.. creates an outstanding atmosphere for everyone, including the customers. In order to have a great manager, they need to have a great District Manager. Those are usually hit and miss. Most of them THINK they know each and every department, not true!"
good,as a dairy manager and cashier was a great place to work learned alot about front end and as a dairy manager how to order and take charge of a whole department
good,"I enjoyed my time here tremendously.  Management was great. We would have meetings where we could just vent and our manager would fix the problems.  Compensation was awesome, too."
good,"I had an internship every Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. I was shown a video on how to work as a courtesy clerk, and I was taught to clean washrooms, pack groceries, help customers in bringing their groceries to their vehicles, put back unwanted products back to its proper shelf, cleaning the floor and many more. All the employees are all nice and the manager as well. I also helped on the produce section and the bakery as a work experience. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers since I was just a work experience but the enjoyable part is meeting new people, new things to learn and new friends to make."
good,"Helping customers with their decisions in buying food and groceries."
good,"Typical day of work includes serving customers without a break but it doesn't happen often."
good,This is a fun place to work but can also be stressful during rushes. It is very fast-paced and there is always something to do so my shifts usually go by pretty fast. Its great to work with others and help customers and has a very friendly atmosphere. Through this job I have learned to be more confident about myself and have learned how to work with others while providing customer service.
good,copy and paste this for every single review because its dumb your site requires me to do this bull just to upload my god darn resume almost there blah blah
good,"It was a fun job. You would have to come to work, stock the truck that came in, and then pull down the entire store. The management was poor. No one knew what was going on. I waa left to do a three person job alone and then got written up for it because I couldn't do it all by myself."
good,"The manager of the store is compassionate and cares for his employees, there is little fear going to the store manager with issues. This being said department managers vary, I have been working with one that does not have any backbone as well as does not want to work at all."
good,"I worked at safeway for four months, the management is understanding and willing to work with you, the pay is fair, benefits are great if you intend to stay and pay your union dues, and as long as you keep busy the day goes by quickly. The customers are the worst part of the job but grumpy customers are few and far between if you are polite."
good,"Safeway is a good job to grow within and use teamwork to get the job done, to make the customer satisfied. My job consists of making sandwiches, making pizzas, doing production, making hot food and salads, and cleaning duties."
good,"I got provided good training for the job. The hours were fine, and the pay was great! I wouldn't mind working there again. the staff and management were very cooperative!"
good,"cut and made food early days and days off, worked in a slow environment most part had experience in handling knifes and cutting utensils. I enjoyed it.."
good,"Typical day began at 4am and continued til orders were complete, "
good,Manger whould bnt listen to new ideal .complety set in his ways which is hisa right . Has no feeling about your life which which effect you work prefomment
good,"A typical day at work is either slow or busy business. I learned customer service, communication skills, computer knowledge and marketing sales. My management was equal and fair towards their fellow employees. The work culture is friendly, safe and clean. The hardest part of the job is running around like a chickens head cut off supervising/maintaining the store and dealing with unsatisfied customers that complained about a situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is when the sun is out and people have a positive attitude plus game days and cheerful holiday spirits too."
good,"Safeway was a fun, great place to work. It wasn't stressful. it was enjoyable from the employees, to the customers, to the corporate staff. It was one big family."
good,"Safeway is a great career for those interested in Retail Environment and desire to be in management. I have worked here for 8 years. They took care of me via scheduling and career advancement, so that I could go to school and further my education for my passion in Human Resources. Great place to work while going to school."
good,"I worked at safeway years ago i started in Alameda and ended in san leandro. I loved the experience, I started as a Deli clerk then applied to meat clerk for a couple years then wanted to try something else so applied for General mechandise cleck where i stayed until i left the company."
good,"It was a great place to work. Fun, fast paced yet not too stressful, everyone is friendly and the environment is fabulous.There's lots of opportunity to advance or move around to departments until you find a fit."
good,"I love shopping at Safeway because their prices are affordable for my family. Unfortunately, my store had a lack of hours at the end of the summer so I had to leave the company."
good,it's a good job but i wasn't getting more hours and no benefits because i wasn't full time and i wasn't with the company for a while and my schedule was too random hours
good,"I enjoyed my time at Safeway. Please note, this was a contract position through KForce, Inc. "
good,"Safeway can be a great company to work depending on management. Many advancement opportunities to secure job, and pay increases frequently for hard workers who are willing to learn."
good,"Fun place to work at,for a first level entry job, have learned a lot in the process of becoming a better at customer service, pay is not bad, however hours aren't that great."
good,Quick paced environment with high expectations in an environment that is constantly changing. The interaction with the customers and resolving their issues uses critical thinking and problem solving thinking.
good,As a cashier. you're pretty much on the register the entire shift. I learned a lot about the products that we sell. Management is okay. They could improve in their communication skills. The hardest part is honestly the customers. You can be the nicest person but some customers WILL put you down. The most enjoyable part is my breaks. Enjoy all breaks. always! lol
good,A vast majority of the employees there wanted to be and work there. Not many found themselves stuck working there and bringing down the overall moral.
good,"Overall, Safeway fostered a positive work life balance and streamlined many work processes in order to achieve this.  They provided a local lunch cafeteria to assist with exercise during the work time and healthy food options."
good,"Stores cultures vary, and so do managers.  I was lucky to have all descent Managers.We get very good benefits as an employee that has worked there for a long time,.  New hires get a little less benifits and pay.  Transferring very hard, the company needs to make it easier."
good,Can be stressful. Can be difficult. Also can be fun and very rewarding. Learned so many things through this company and met so many people. Teaches you skills for even outside grocery world.
good,Very decent job with plenty of room for advancement for those with the drove and ambition. I worked for them before the buyout so I can't really speak to its current state.
good,"I take job in my job working at safeway, I like working as a team and getting to know my customers. Management is approachable and i value their opinion. I appreciate the openness of the management to my suggestions. I feel valued as an employee."
good,"A typical day at work can be fast paced and on your feet a lot."
good,"I am a FT employee as Produce Manager at a largest sales volume in my District , responsible to delivery Customer Service, Drive sales , meet my goals"
good,Good job for my transition from high school to college. Hours were flexible and management was usually willing to take requests off into consideration.
good,"It use to be a fun work place, now employee s are lazy and don't want to work. I would not recommend it to a person who has a family. The hours and pay is not good for them no."
good,"it was  part time job so gave me the freedom to do other things outside of working, Some members of the management were a bit difficult but overall a good company."
good,"The new collective agreement has horrible wages. After 2 years of full time hours, I was only making $12.20 an hour. It's an industry where customers have no respect for workers, and believe if they throw a temper tantrum, they will receive either free product or a gift certificate. This is based on over 25 years in this Industry. The old contract at least had a living wage."
good,good place to work. great benefits. made everything from scratch back then. hardest part of job was washing the large mixers between batches of breads or cookies or cake batter. customer service was a priority here. you would leave your area to show a customer where a product was if asked. I earned most of my baking process here at this store.
good,I really enjoyed working here! My manager was kind of a jerk but my co-workers were awesome! I worked as a cashier and stocked when I wasn't in the register.
good,"Great benefits,  good pay. Works around school schedules.  Advancement is available in every department.  Great staff and Management.  Must be available weekends and holidays."
good,"-Closing on the register from 3-12 as a new person"

good,Its a great place to work if you have the right people who understand your situation. I have been blessed with the people Ive worked with for the last couple years.  All I can say is be open and honest with your management team and they will do their best to work with you as much as possible.
good,"Safeway is good place to work with multi-culture people and learn from them , the management always support us , in Safeway i learned how to work and deal with different customers and make sure them always been satisfied"
good,love that you get the chance to advance within the company. great place to work  for feels like a second family. upper management change frequently and with out notice
good,"Great place to work,family atmosphere. Fast paced and demanding pharmacy. I learned to deal with all types of people in my 16 years at Safeway. I would suggest Safeway as a great place to work."
good,"Excellent Benefits, flexible schedule, great managers. High level of customer service, worked every major holiday. Excellent pay after 10 years ... face paced and you have to be on your feet up to 8 hours ...."
good,I worked in the deli as a closer and I always felt that we were understaffed and the managers expected us to do some much work with little time and lots of customers.
good,"This is your everyday cashier part time job.  There isn't anything particularly special about this job from any other cashier job.  Remembering numbers for produce can be a pain, but it comes quickly with the job.  The superiors were all quite respectful of everyone."
good,"Safeway was a decent place to work, the staff was nice and there was many customers who I would see on a weekly basis. Most of the workers won't be afraid to help another co-worker."
good,"Co workers are great and encourage, help you out all the time and are very friendly. Same goes for the managers! The customers majority of the time from my experience have been very friendly and kind and have known since I first started working at Safeway. It's kind of like a family-friend type relationship at Safeway because you see the same people all the time and its just refreshing to see them again, wonderful work environment."
good,I was in high school when i got hired here and i learned some much from the vets that i still apply it to my everyday work life made so friends and knew every single customer that walking in the store
good,"Employees and customers made this job worthwhile, Big company, but a lot of great experiences and learning opportunities in a large company. Would work for again."
good,"Working there was fun. The other employees were always willing to help out in the time of need, and everyone treated each other like family, and as equals."
good,company no longer exists was taken over bye morrisons then  bye the coop shop no longer exists was a good company to work for good shifts was hard work at times
good,"Overall, Safeway was a very fun, and rewarding experience for me. There were several times it seemed the upper management took my shift managers for granted, but other than that the store was great. My coworkers were by far the best part of my job, they always helped and did their fair share. The customers were also pretty amazing, we had such characters there!"
good,"My work day generally starts at 4am, I stock throughout the morning and write the daily order before noon. Before I leave the store I make sure the rest of the employees know that goal for the day. Ive learned a lot in the last 9 years of, how the company runs, plus I have grown a lot as well."
good,"Safeway has an amazing culture of employees that work through out the day. I have learned how to use communication skills to my best advantage, becoming a manager at the age of 18 was a great accomplishment I have obtained but the hardest part was having other employee view the same way. I loved being able to guide the courtesy clerks and show them how I obtained the position I was currently in. I very much enjoyed training new employees and show them the right way to complete a job task. Overall Safeway made me the hard worker I am today, there was never a dull moment. I have learned how to handle to store when the power was out! Taught myself to preserve and maintain perishable foods and take frozen foods to the main freezers."
good,"Safe way is always active envirornment "
good,"It was nice, a few issues but a nice part time job. If you need to make some extra money it will work out. They need some help and I had no issue with co-workers"

good,"I learned alot about sales, and money management, the beauty of coupon clipping.. And fixing the costumers problems. Also working the register at a fast and peace."
good,"Always kept busy, never a dull moment. Great friendships made and tons of experience. Since the changeover of companies, it was a bit more difficult due to huge changes within. Training was available, but did not always apply to work needs. Over all it is an addicting atmosphere in the management type work. You're always on the go."
good,"I learned a lot of communication skills, and how to run a check stand. The co-workers were all nice and caring, and so were the managers. Every day was a bit challenging, sometimes having to do more than you have to do, but in the end, it was enjoyable."
good,"I was able to advance rapidly at this company and the training was awesome. Great benefits, and I enjoy working with the public."
good,"Working for this company is great. Work is repetitive as far as entering benefit payments, obtaining medical status, contacting attorneys in regards to their clients."
good,Bob's Burger Express was a wonderful company to work for. You got life skills from working there. they always promoted people who were highly motivated and great at customer service. I enjoyed working there for years. co-workers were wonderful.I enjoyed all aspects of my job.
good,A typical day at work started with greeting customers and helping them find what they needed to find. I learned that hard work and dedication can get you a long way. The management at this establishment was really friendly and always encouraged you too do your best. My co-workers were extremely serviceable they always tried their hardest to please the customers. The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy the customers needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping out customers fill their needs and seeing them leave happy.
good,"Great place to work but the hours are not enough. A typical day is steady  , I've learned how to deal with people more,work as a team mate,I've learned to focus more on the customers less on the staff from management."
good,"My day starts with Organizing the Bread and customer service and proceeds to Cashier work as well as customer satisfaction and friendly service. Ive learned back stock administration as well as Cashier work and refined my customer engagement and satisfaction."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of counting the self serve products in the bakery and recording the numbers in the book provided by the manager. Tagging products 50% off as needed according to the dates. Fill the self serve. All this needs to be done before the store opens at 8am. After that a bread order must be done before 9am. Then the bread wall must be filled and any special orders must be ready to go. finally a list is made and the frozen treats are taken out of the freezer and stocked on the shelves. If im the last one in the bakery i must make sure everything is packaged and the bakery freezers like the cake displays are working properly by taking temperatures, the bakery is clean and the ovens are off."
good,"Great part time job with awesome management. Co-Workers get along well, all work as a team to accomplish joint tasks."
good,"Typical day at work is a 8 hour shift. Where you have 2 breaks and 1 30 minutes launch. I have learned to deal with customers without causing any trouble to the customer, and safeway."
good,"It depends on the industry, company and position you are interviewing with/for. For example, for a job where technical competencies are of the utmost importance, it is often beneficial to list the skills closer to the top of the resume, right underneath the resume objective or resume summary statement."
good,"Simple straight forward job. Can be stressful sometimes due to the high demand of customer service needed during events like Bay to Breakers, but still manageable. The best part of the job for me was that the manager was understanding with my school schedule and worked around that."
good,My day sometimes started off as early as 5 a.m. or as late as 2 p.m.  It sometimes would be as easy as simply stocking the meats and cutting inventory.  Or it maybe be as busy due to a holiday and the grills were jumping for fresh cut meats.
good,Safeway was a good place to work.  I was there for over 30 years. My co-workers were nice to work with. Benefits were great.
good,"Good company to work for, room to advance, great people to work with.. The Job itself it's challenging, but not to bad once you get use to it. Great paid and  Benefits."

good,i like it. its fun and nice. i like to work because i get paid. it's enjoyable and rewarding. i like the perks of the job. its pretty awesome working with people that are nice and also fun.
good,"Coworkers were amazing. Everyone did their jobs. Management recommended to ""voluntarily quit"". Management doesn't know how to communicate with employees."
good,"Being a courtesy clerk at Safeway was very typical. I did the same thing everyday. Some days were very tiring because I worked long hours. However, this was my first job and it taught me perseverance and grit."
good,"i love working nights so this job was the best i had besides getting like 17-20 pallets one night but still got the work done, just five or six of us all working in a closed store having fun but was able to get the shelves stocked, boxes broke down and outside aisles cleaned up before store opened up"
good,"great place to start and earn work ethic but when it comes to moving up in the chain of command they have favorites,im sure its only the one in lodi,they do alot of things that are usually not along company guidelines regarding safety and job responsibility,managers will take your ignorance for granted when performing a task they ask you to do,that your completely required or trained to do at all."
good,I advanced very quick working for Safeway. In am a very fast learner and I am very easy to get along with as well as great customer service. I really enjoyed working in all departments. I love doing numerous tasks
good,Great for the most part. Didn't really enjoy pushing carts in the rain. Managers are understanding with schedules. Flexible. Always on your feet which is good. Great environment if able to get along with everyone and pass the time
good,"I work for Safeway for five years.  During that time, I held a multitude of different positions; both at the store level and the corporate level.  If you work with management, they will work with you.  You will be given opportunities, you only need to seize them!"
good,"A typical work day starts off slow in the morning then picks up during the day. The management is alright and helps out when needed. I typically learn how to make new drinks. My co-workers are always step up when needed, and they are always great to work with. I think the hardest part of the job is to tell a costumer that we are out of something and I cant make there drink. My favorite part of the job is getting to know the costumers better, helping them with anything I can."
good,I enjoyed working at Safeway. They give you flexible hours and work around your schedule.My co workers are friendly and more than helpful. The most enjoyable part of working at safeway are the people you meet and build a relationshop with.
good,"Good company to work for, especially with the changes happening with other major retailers and their pharmacies. The staff is very supportive and inviting to work with. They are very flexible with scheduling as well. The pharmacy has tripled in volume, so efficiency is needed to finish the tasks. The customers are very nice and very loyal. They have created a bond with the staff that is so refreshing to see when dealing with merging 3 pharmacies into one."
good,Safeway is a great company to work for.  There is plenty of room for advancement in your career. They are a Union Shop with great benefits and job security.
good,"Safeway has gone through a log of good transformation and it's a superb place to work and thrive.  Management style was supportive, they advocate a positive and collaborative work environment.  If you're fast-paced you may find yourself bored and perhaps impatient here, but you'll appreciate the absolute and unmatched kindness of every individual.  New ideas go through so much back and forth that by the time we're ready to implement the idea becomes old."
good,A place that is good place to start for students or anyone who needs a flexible schedule.  There are indeed oppurtunities to rise in the company if you show the inititave.
good,"A very fast paced and friendly place of bussiness. The deli is a very intense department and everything you do is very important wich make you feel needed. Manager is very friendly but stll knows what needs to be done. It's tough to keep people because the work is pretty hard, so we went through several new hires within my first 6 months of working there."
good,"Seeing how this is my second job, it is a very good one. Management team is very cool, the job will work with you. Schedule is very flexible."
good,"Though only working for three months, currently, I find the experience of working at Safeway to be decently fulfilling and I tend to constantly look forward to my next shift. The guests we serve daily are always friendly and enjoy our friendliness in return and are always eager to see what new surprises and deals we'll be bringing out next."
good,"Assistant manager wasn't always polite to customers or employees. Some days were slow and not as productive, most days were really busy with not a lot of down time. At times it would be busier in one department then it would be in others. most employees worked great as a team and would very often help out in another department if it was busier then theirs."
good,Great Management. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and management encourage you to network with other departments.
good,"while I was at Safeway I closed the books for the prior day sales. I maintained deposit for Armor truck, I open and or closed all cash draws. I handled returns and complaints from customers."
good,It was one of the best way to picture a first job. I really enjoyed working there for 3 years. Met a lot of great people and learned many things about my co-workers and also customers if you like working a fast pace with a smile on your face you should work here.
good,"A lot of running around doing your own tasks and helping other employees with others whether its watching the customer service desk, cashing, filing out timecards to ensure employees get paid, helping meet customers needs and ensuring they are happy with the service you are providing them. "
good,Work at Safeway was fun and quite good. I was a valued staff. I would have stayed but needed to help my wife with our baby since she was was going to Nursing school during the day. This was the reason I joined Shoppers first as an overnight pharmacists. The benefits and compensation was quite good.
good,"Busy day with alot of work to do, alot to learn."
good,Fun work place with supportive management.Not all about the number but how you personally grow and develop. Gain good experience
good,"10+ employees to supervise, timing for each individuals break. Learned how to lead and set the tone work wise. Maintain function of self checkout station."
good,"enjoyed my experience with safeway, but reach my potential in the job i was doing and was no longer rewarding....applied for Management but was overlooked many times even in seniority so time to move on...."
good,"Man kann sich seine Stunden bis zu zwei Wochen vorher bestimmen, alle Kassierer Jobs teilzeit |(bis zu 30 Std pro Woche), sehr nette Kollegen, auf individuelle Stundenrequests oder freie Tage wird eingegangen."
good,"A typical day at work involved 2 15-minute paid breaks and a 30-minute unpaid lunch break. The beginning of my shift usually involved wrapping the meat that had not been wrapped and put out yet. At some point through out the day temperature logs would have to be taken. Constantly I would be checking how the meat shelves look, rearranging to make the products more presentable to customers. Near the end of the day, everyone else's shift is over, so it's just me. I would clean up the meat processing equipment as fast as possible, and then serve customers at the counter until 30 mins before closing. Then, I would close down the counter and store the products from the counter. One last check of the shelves and putting out any products in the backroom, and I was done."
good,"The management at GWL was not the best, and the work conditions were not ideal. I really enjoyed working as a lifeguard at GWL though regardless of these issues."
good,Very flexible workplace. Manageable daily duties and not overly stressful. Management is pretty good they dont ask too much and are fair. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with very upset customers. The most enjoyable part is the friendly coworkers and relaxed environment.
good,It was a cool work enivorment the only thing i didn't like about was goin outside on a hot day and get carts from outside. The thing one enjoy about it is communicating with other people
good,"A typical day would be, Walking in and checking orders, breaking down hot foods."
good,It is a fun place to work just not enough hours given to part time workers. I've learnt many things at Safeway as i started when i just finished school. The other employees are very friendly and easy to get along with.
good,The HR team was great.  Retail grocery was an interesting learning experience for me after nearly 20 years in the Banking industry.
good,This is a great place to work but it is a temp position that will not lead to anything else. People are great managers are great.
good,"i had a blast working in the store in San Diego, Pacific beach, and was able to advance quickly to run a deli team to execute the daily tasks of helping customers, prepping food, following food safety protocols and cleaning. it taght me many more management skills and was a favorite among may customers for my friendly personality"
good,Safeway was a good company to work for. The managment was professional in policy as well the standards they required from their employees. The benefits and pay were very good in comparison to those with a college education.
good,"I would open the kiosk, I learned people skills and how to interact with others in an effective manner. The hardest part of the job would be waking up to be at work by 4:30 the easiest would be remembering how to make the drinks"
good,"As a Leader for Safeway, I have learned much about advanced inventory controls, safety and daily audit processes and most importantly, customer satisfaction. The competitive nature of the business, requires you to constantly look for ways to improve the store and our team to raise standards, drive sales, increase quality and make our customers happy. "
good,"I love my current job at Safeway, I love who I wok with and I enjoy the customers there. I am glad they have provided me a chance to become a bookkeeper because I am good at what I do."

good,"Great place to work for and the most fun part of the job is the crew, I learned how to accomplished goals as a team or as a group. Group motivation is the key and my co-workers are the best motivators  even the worst time of the night."
good,Great place to work at and management is fair. It allows you to make a difference not just on your job but to the community through diversity networks as well.
good,"Safeway is a great place to work if you are looking to maximize your work day as well as have the proper work life balance."

good,loved my job it was a great growing and learning experience for me
good,A typical day at work would helping and serving customers in a speedy and friendly manner. Also since I was second in charge I helped out with receiving and putting away loads also assisted with orders and conference calls. I enjoyed guiding my coworkers with anything they needed help with and made me very proud that they came to me for help or questions they had about the company. My favorite part of the job was the relationships I had with my regular customers it was a pleasure for me serving them a conversating with them on a daily basis.
good,As long as you work as hard as you can and with the smile the company will appreciate you.
good,Bag grocery and help customers out to there cars. Keep area clean in front with cashier and clean ups.Do go backs. Customer service.
good,I loved working with Safeway as you never got a day that was the same as the last.  My co-worker where great people to be around and also upbeat with plenty smiles going round.  The hardest part of the job was taking in complaints but the best part of the job was turning the customers frown upside down when they walked out satisfied with the service provided by us as a team.
good,Most diverse place to work. Everyday a fun and stressful sometimes.
good,"I learned that supervisors can be very manageable. Most enjoyable part of working there was, is that we could go on breaks and talk stories with our co workers from the same department or from different departments. We could get along with each other. Manager is very kind. Hardest part of the job is of how they explained of how hard it is just to make the product(s) in less within 5-10 minutes, but it took me couple days just to get things right."
good,I had a wonderful experience working there I was jsut unstable at that time . Staff was excellent.
good,"Typical day included maintaining the frozen foods section, and helping customers.  Fellow workers and management were fun and enjoyable to work with and helped the day go by quickly.  my experiances i have gained there have helped me manage my time wisely and efectively while multitasking other job duties."
good,"A typical day at work would be helping the customers and to communicate and to get all my duties done. I learned how the Safeway and Grocery life works. All my co workers were such sweet hearts, I loved them all. The hardest part of the job was training to become a courtesy clerk and getting the hang of everything. The most enjoyable was working with people and communicating with everyone."
good,Fast acting environment. Worked in partnership. Management would be understanding in at certain times. Co- workers weir fun to work with. Hardest part of the job was having to carry certain heavy things. Mos enjoyable part of the job was seeing a smile on a customer face.
good,"great training and benifits"
good,"Overall this was a good place to work. Low stress levels aloud any stress to stay at work and not go home with you. Most management was great, Director at the time was horrible. She has since been released from the company. Very redundant but most customer service positions are."
good,"A typical day at work usually starts by checking in with management, whether it be a food clerk or freight crew in order to see if there are any changes in routine regarding customer service, products coming in to be transported, and/or product knowledge. My day then begins by transporting products around the store on six wheelers or dollies. Once the products are placed, they are 'thrown' on the shelves and arranged appropriately. I then order products that are low in quantity or empty on the shelves.The rest of the store is then 'faced' or products pulled to the front of the shelves to be more available to customers. This is also done with the dairy and frozen departments till we clock off at 845am. As a food clerk, you are bagging and checking out groceries and assisting customers with what they need until your shift is over."
good,I was a good first job. I went on my two weeks notice to focus on my nurse aide training.
good,"I worked night crew for the last four months I was with Safeway. 5-6 days a week, 8.5 hours a night. Clocked on at 9:30 and off at 6. I had three coworkers, two older guys(30-40) and a 20 yr. old. First, we would break down the load onto different carts and wheelers. Each aisle had its own wheeler, and product was organized on wheelers in descending order down the aisle. I learned a lot about organization in my time at Safeway. The wheelers would be taken out to corresponding aisles and thrown to the shelf over the course of the night. After all product was thrown, we were required to face the shelves, which made the store look really nice by the end of the night. On most nights, a perishable load of dairy, produce, meat and frozen product will arrive between midnight and three. Normally, I would put away the perishable load because my coworkers had more experience and could throw freight to the shelf much faster than I. My personal favorite part of the job was having the store closed between 1-5. No customers for four hours really helps when you're trying to stay focused and working fast. My least favorite part was that night crew was all about speed. Precision was important, but I was constantly being pushed to move faster and empty wheelers quicker. After a month, I was at a comfortable pace where my coworkers didn't bother to critique me anymore and we all had some really nice conversations with each other. And finally, my manager, Randy. I never really got to know Randy too well, but I knew that I was one of his go to guys when anyone called out sick or they needed someone"
good,"The best part of working for Safeway was the people, my coworkers as well as the customers who became my friends. Management was a group of high-energy, funny, positive, and engaging people."
good,My typical day at safeway would be going in at 5am and starting to get the meats and cheese and salads done for the front case. i learned that getting along with everyone that you work with will make your day go by so much faster. management was great i mean they were tough when they had to but they were nice people. my co-workers were mostly people i had known for a while because my sister would work there before. the hardest part of my job was getting rude customers that would really disrespect me. the thing i mostly liked about my job was that everyone would help each other without thinking about it.
good,"When I worked at Vons, I helped out customers by bagging their food and service them to their cars. I assist managers by running the front end, push carts, stocking down items, and learn to be a clerk. Vons was only 2 blocks from where I lived so it was perfect for me to come in anytime they need me."
good,"I worked in almost every department I learned alot,and enjoyed my work and made some great friends,I was a cashier and a food and produce clerk this company is male run and so you can feel a little intimidated at times."
good,"Generally a pleasant atmosphere,always something to keep you busy making for quick days. Gained a great deal of product knowledge, store operations, customer relations and people, I enjoyed working with many co-workers of varying ethnic backgrounds. Always interesting."
good,I got along with all my co-workers and they made the job worthwhile. Management also cared for the workers and made sure we had what we needed. They were flexible in schedules and worked around my school schedule.
good,"Great place to work of your a team player and a hard worker. A typical day was coming in and breaking down a thousand piece load. We would spot it by isle and then throw the load to the shelves. When we finished the load, I would go to the back and do a pick list and check invoices."
good,Typical day includes scanning customers groceries and providing world class service for everyone
good,I had a great time working there and had many challenges that made me grow.
good,"Safeway was a great job and perfect for summer students who just need a job for the summer.  I went home tired a lot due to running around cleaning messes on floors and bringing in carts etc."
good,"meet greet customers, cook, slice, prepare food"
good,I worked for Safeway for 22 years. I loved my job but it was time to retire. I was not able to constantly lift 70 lbs. I enjoyed my time there and the wonderful people I worke with and served.
good,"Safe was a stable, productive place to work. For me, the hardest part of the job is standing on my feet for 4 - 8 hours depending on length of shift. The most enjoyable aspect was the people - co-workers, customers and management. Everyone is friendly, helpful, understanding and considerate of others. The customers for the most part are also friendly - if one is having a bad day, I would try to cheer them up. Several have commented on my happy outgoing disposition, my smile made their day more enjoyable."
good,"Being a Department Manager came with allot of responsibilities which I handled well. Starting the day depending on the day I would receive shipments, print new sale signs, sales & sanitation reviews. Onto checking upcoming sales, checking inventory & ordering products. Safety, Sanitation, & Sales Audits, Department Maintenace. Continuing with bringing out shipment, changing sales signs, checking experation dates, ongoing customer service & cashier, occasional new employee training, catering orders. I was the safety representative for the department. Role played with random employees on a regular basis & quized them on product knoledge including price, scripts, & coplimantery suggestions. The most difficult part of the job was keeping up with customers at times when short handed, it was a busy most of the day. The thing I enjoyed the most was creating my own lunch."
good,Everyone was pretty professional and light hearted. A few uptight people but no one who would not help out if they were asked.
good,"I enjoyed much contact with the customers as a cashier for almost 12 years as well as getting chances to ""float"" to different departments such as help in the deli, meat and floral departments. I advanced within the company from courtesy clerk to JourneyMan Cashier, and the pay doubled. It was a good learning experience"

good,"its mostly busy, upbeat co- workers that are very supportive, and is usually a nice and a productive day. alot of customer service."
good,"Come in to clock in and talk to all the awesome co-workers you work with. Learned many things such as how to order dairy products and how to stock the shelves properly by making it look great. Managment was okay, like any other company, but they did give everyone room to advance."
good,"Working for Safeway is a company that allows growth but demands intense productivity and perfection. Although it is very fast pace in management positions it gives the ability to learn a great deal of skills; such as delegating jobs and people, learning the software on computer and hand held devices, customer service being number one, knowing how to handle all situations to keep the customer happy and employees, and learning all about the retail operation of sales, inventory and keeping product that is in demand. I really enjoy the people I work with that makes a huge difference, because it keeps a friendly and fun environment. Working at Safeway there is always something to do and sometimes you just wish you had more time to do more."
good,Safeway is a great organization! I really valued my tenue with Safeway. I was an IT Project Manager within the Application Development group. The management is very supportive and the environment is very collaborative. There's a lot of great projects to work on and a lot of opportunities to learn. The most difficult part of project management at Safeway are the processes and checkpoints that they have in place. This can make it difficult to move project through. This can be frustrating at times.
good,"I've been working with Canada safe way over 5 years I have always enjoyed my employment,by means of hard working and true commitment I have had greatly contributed to improvement of the store management and customer satisfaction,work with team ,able to follow direction,how set up and operate ,work with equipment, excellent co-workers,good management,when safe way, customer and management satisfies the most enjoyable part of my job"
good,Very fast paced if you are a hard worker. You can move around if you are adaptive and flexable. Enjoyable because it is not slow and always something to do.
good,"As long as you put you all in your job, you will have a job at Safeway(Starbucks). The co- workers are friendly and keep a sense of strong teamwork. Our manager who gives both positive and negative feedback in order to keep her employs at their best, she also provides excellent communication. The hardest part of our job is around frapaccino happy hour when the pressure is on and we have a million things to do at once, but what makes it all worth wile is knowing we just made all those customers that much happier holding that special cup of coffee."
good,the most enjoyable part was meeting the customers needs all the employees were really helpfull specially on the first days of training and i improved my ability to work great during busy times during the day and still satisfy every customers needs.
good,"Worked for Vons Pavilions in Santa Monica and WLA for 16 yrs. Enjoyed the customers. Management has no clue how to treat the staff. Regardless of what people say there is room for advancement. I worked as nightcrew clerk, deli/dairy clerk, back up book keeper, checker, and finished my career as a supervisor. Moved to Denver, 1999. Safeway in Colorado are the biggest morons on the planet. Left Safeway 1 year later. Good luck."
good,"You will never be bored working for Safeway. There is always something new to learn and do. I learned that if you work hard and show an interest you can go almost anywhere you want with this company. The management, for the most part, is there for you and willing to help you with anything. The people you work with become like family. The ability to advance quickly is a huge benefit to working for Safway but if you're not careful you can end up spending all your time there."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being creative and free to come up with new and chasllenging ideas.
good,"I started in the Message Center, and worked my way up through the ranks to Assistant Buyer. At first the job was great, but, when all the political and politics entered into the picture, I wanted out. After 21 years, they let all of us go that had 20+ years tenure. An age thing, perhaps? DEFINITELY!"
good,"We all had fun on the job, and still were able to get thing done well before the shift was over."
good,"Customer Service, cooking, and cleaning. Worked as early as 11am to as late as 10pm. Relaxed inviorment and a great place to build a career."
good,Being a courtesy clerk was fairly pleasant and can be beneficial to yourself due to being around people and having to engage in helping and talking to anyone in the store. If you are good with people and aren’t shy to help anyone then this a great job.
good,"This was a good first job. I excelled quickly here, however management was hesitant to move me ahead in terms of salary. I stayed in an underpaid position, completing the work of other positions."
good,I learned a lot about workplace culture. How to be professional and how to talk to people. How to behave in a work place environment. How to handle stress and deal with difficult customers. Learning to stay completely calm in a stress full situation.
good,"Safeway is a great company to work for, when I need to request days off they never have a problem making sure I have that day off. They are very understanding of their staff and care about us"
good,This was my first ever job and I loved it. The co-workers and management were very good. there was some very fast paced days and some very slow paced days.
good,"I work as a courtesy clerk. My job duties include bagging groceries, gathering carts, sweeping up the store."
good,I have made a friendships with many of my customers. I firmly believe that they make our pay check so with out them I am broke. So I do my best every day to give 100% to my customers. I am responsible for a lot of things like writing and putting away loads. Writing a schedules that fits everyone's needs. The hardest part of my job is pleasing everyone. Sometimes that is just not a doable thing. Hardest part of my job is keeping people that can handle the slow periods of the off season.
good,gained a lot of experience and got to meet new people and help out a lot of customers. i was always willing to come in and help out whenever they needed me.
good,You have some downtime because you dont' have that many customers until a certain time of day. What i don t like about it is I need something that i can pay my bills and right now it is not working
good,The job consisted of ensuring that items were scanned and bagged properly while maintaining a comforting atmosphere for the customer. I've learned to focus on getting single tasks done proficiently rather than attempting to multi-task constantly to get quality work done. Management was very friendly even when situations got stressful. The whole workplace had a very welcoming attitude. The hardest part of the job was being under pressure during certain situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a nice flow at times during transactions.
good,"Everyone that worked there was really nice, and it was easy to make friends.  the manager was good, and treated people right.  it was a little sketchy, being a female courtesy clerk at times.  they did make me get shopping carts by myself at 11pm.  but when i brought it to the attention of a manager, the rules where changed.  i do miss working there at times."
good,"Enjoy working at Safeway, however getting any type of raise can be difficult.  Its a pretty laid back environment, can be stressful at times. Hardest part is getting time with upper management to discuss issues."
good,"Working at Safeway as a curtesy clerk, your typical day was bagging groceries, Helping people out to their cars if they needed help, sweeping the stores, cleaning bathrooms, and bringing in carts. The thing that I loved the most working there was my coworkers, They are super fun to work with! I think that the hardest part of the job was having todo carts in the really hot sun wearing black clothing, or having todo carts when it was dumping down rain."
good,"This was the first time that I worked in a food, convenient store environment. With my nervousness I felt supported from day one. The training was spot on and the atmosphere was fast and exciting. The staff and management were like a team. Loved it!"
good,I've worked at other chain stores and none have been like Safeway. My coworkers are really cool and the management actually seems to be super involved with everything that is going on around the store. The guests that come in usually are regulars and it's cool to build a sort of rapport with them.
good,"A typical day would be getting the produce department up and running ready for business, providing the customers with the best quality available.. The most satisfying part of the job was knowing you had great product which amounted in sales"
good,"Had a great experience loved to work for this company. "
good,i loved all my coworkers and it was like and extended family!!! managmet was very organised and reliable! Thet were willing to work around my school schedule and still give me good hours!!!
good,I enjoyed working at the Safeway 1827 in La grande Oregon. Worked their for about two years before I moved for school. Payed each week on a Thursday and got hours when I needed them.
good,"only two people working overnight. was able to listen to music while i worked. didnt have to deal to much with other manager, employees or customers. ok place to work for."
good,Clock in and pull the product that's on pallets from the back of the store to the front of the store. then stock the shelves. Then face the store( make sure all labels are facing forward).
good,Safeway was a great place to work. The people were friendly and the job was simple but fast paced. Some of the courtesy clerk tasks are tedious but not hard.
good,"I had the opportunity to learn a lot of necessary basic skills while working for Safeway, a typical day of work allowed me to exercise my communication and customer service skills. The hardest part of my job was standing in one place on my feet for hours on end. Working for Safeway taught me how to use patience and compassion with customers. The management at that specific store was not very compassionate or understanding when I was undergoing a severe health condition at the time, i am an employee with a great amount of respect and expect that in return."
good,I spent 3 years working for Safeway and I was constantly learning how to do new things. Every step of the way my superiors understood my value to the company and gave me different duties to complete. I ended up doing my own job duties as well as many other duties throughout the store. I enjoy learning new things so this was an amazing job atmosphere for me.
good,"It is a nice environment to work at because, my co-workers and all of our employees, in general, are nice and caring and friendly. It's fun to work together with others and interact with many customers."
good,Great place pay was questionable sometimes compared to how much we worked. Management sometimes cared too much about themselves but sometimes they liked out as much as possible
good,I like how friendly the people working in thw store where i am.good management.it has union which i like the most.competitive salary.they also have good benefits for both full tume and part time
good,"I had many roles at Safeway. I started in the Deli working with food and that was very fast paced and sometimes stressful because there was not enough staffing. Then I moved to customer service desk which I liked, there was a lot of paper work involvement which became easier overtime. I did safe counts, money orders, western unions, and plenty more. I also helped out in floral quite often learning about the different arrangements of sorts, especially in the busy seasons such as mother's day and valentines day. I would definitely say that Safeway is a career opportunity for growth and expansion."
good,"I worked for this company for 12 years and would have continued if they did store to store transfers, but they don’t. The only reason I left was because I had to move."
good,you knew exactly what your job duties were. They actually train you for the position your hired for. the company encourages you to compete for instore job training in different departments.
good,"Great job if you're looking for fast-paced part time job. They will also work with your school schedule. I learned how to handle cash register, increased my customer service skills and loved the employees."
good,I had a great manage who saw my potential and gave me opportunity for greater responsibility. The Safeway I worked at was in a college town so many of my coworkers were my age and make work enjoyable.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with customers and helping them find what they are looking for. Management was great and I was able to get promoted two times to different departments of the store.
good,"A lot of my managers were very good people and I enjoyed working with but have a problem with my 2nd assistant manager for both my stores."
good,The co-workers were extremely friendly.  The manager and assistant manager were great.  Hours were great if you are a part-time type of a person.  A typical day consisted of just managing carts and bagging grocery.  What I learned during the job was how to be a cashier.  The customers that go through the Vons were great as well.  Didn't have one single problem with a customer.
good,Managers worked well with employees. Job was fast paced and enjoyable. All the staff in the produce department were friendly and great to work with especially the immediate supervisor.
good,Learn your cashier system quickly to have the best interaction with the customers. Show up on time keep busy when the store is slow and smile. The more friendly you are the better you look for the bosses. Everyone is nice and you meet new people everyday.
good,"Very welcoming staff, I have learned many things in past as i have grown with in this company. Management is very helpful and is always there to help. Enjoyable job."
good,"I upheld multiple positions at Safeway,starting off as a courtesy clerk, then moving to cashier the starbucks all in a matter of a year. I learned to work in fast paced areas and be responsible for starbucks as well as the front end at times. Working at safeway helped me improve my customer service skills, I became highly favorable to customers and management recieving letters of recommendations as well as earning employee of the month. I loved being a Safeway employee because it expanded my working abilities and learned more about grocery retail."
good,I loved my decade long career with this company but got tried of the union fighting with corporate. If the union not tried to be so intense I probably would have stayed with them.
good,Very easy environment to move up/advance. Plenty of departments/areas to excel. Friendly environment for the most part. Guaranteed 40 hours a week and full good benefits if full time.
good,"There are many tasks to do in a work shift. Overall, our priorities were always about the customers satisfaction shopping at Safeway. Also, you receive great benefits while working with Safeway."
good,"I liked the work that I did cause if you did your job right then you basically can deliver at your own pace and you didn't have to worry about rushing to get it done. Plus, you get to listen to your own music and they have a work phone for you to use for gps and clocking in."
good,"The particular Safeway/Vons that I work at is a fast pace, fairly large grocery store. I think management and the employees do the best job possible. I learned and gained a lot more patience than I thought I had. The service deli is a very fast paced environment,even without the management aspect of it. I have observed a lot of employees voice their anger, frustrations, and stress over the job. Although, I think it is important, working in the deli, it is not what I envision myself doing for the future so it is hard for me to get frustrated and angry about the job. Even with that said, I still take my job very seriously and do the work to the best of my ability. I was promoted to assistant manager barely into my first year of work for the company. The most enjoyable part for me is seeing customers on a consistent basis that are pleasant and appreciate my service."
good,A typical work day here is all customer driven. Satisfied customers keep employee hours up. It is a team atmosphere. All departments work together. The hardest part of this job is caring for angry and unsatisfied customers. I enjoyed most was training employees and ensuring they were comfortable in their position they were hired to do. Being a resource at different levels was enjoyable because it was something different each time. This was not a routine day in and day out job. It posed many challenges due to unique situations.
good,"Fun. Co-workers, leaving something every day, go I to work and right away it's overwhelmed depending on the department. Others are just as bad just not to bad."
good,"Good place to work.  get to perform other pharmacy services that are not available in other retail settings, such as prescribing birth controls and provide specialty injections."
good,I got into a car accident and wasn't even able to get into contact with anyone. I called multiple times to get in contact with a manager but I got put on hold and hung up on so I had to quit without saying anything because I wasn't able to go to work because of my car accident.
good,"I learned a lot from my last manager as far as predicting sales and working on excel spreadsheets. loved working with my customers, small town store. Was able to move up quickly with this company"
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is just having fun while you were working. All superiors are supportive with everyone else. Good benefits. but I wish  full time
good,"Nice people. It's a lot of work but I always get it done. I love making salads, fruit and veggie trays. I've gotten lots of positive feedback from customers."
good,Usually getting up early leaving to work i learned to do more things as i worked there management was O.K. i would've like a more nicer and appreciative management
good,Safeway had high energy with employees eager to go and help customers when needed. Employees and Management carried smiles on their faces and was very friendly. There was a lot of down time but work was high energy with much movement. Management was friendly and would look offer ways to work with the employees and provide help. A typical day at work consisted of communicating with customers and providing help when needed. I learned how to communicate better with customers and how to be as helpful as possible around the work place. The workplace culture was very friendly and high energy. We could joke around and everyone was willing to help in some way. The hardest part of the job would be during the rush hour points when the store was full and we had to manage to take care of many customers with little to no break time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to connect with many different characters
good,"Silverton Safeway Starbucks is a nice place to be at. It's very out going, its fun, and you honestly get to socialize while working. The environment is fast paced and up beat"
good,"I would go to work at 4 in the morning. Grab a cart ,long on to the personnel orders and start shopping. Going aisle by aisle shopping for 8 people at once."
good,"This place was fast paced, No nonsense, but also a fun place to work .The management team is very fair and and willing to help you out in a crisis, (work related or not). I've learned (in my last 14 years with them) how to think fast, multi task, and find my way out of a jam. I really enjoyed my time there and hope to find employment with a company that has the same feel"
good,worked here long time it can be a great place to work. great benefits but management can be manipulative.and only about company no concerns to personal life
good,My typical day at work consists of serving customers while having a great discussion about their day and other topics. I keep the kiosk clean as much as possible to avoid safety hazards. I learned what it means to work with a team: to pull your own weight and to communicate fluently in a group. I respect my manager a lot due to the fact that she can strike up a conversation with me or can help me anytime when I have any questions. The atmosphere for the Safeway I work at is a very welcoming and peaceful place to be in. I always feel ready to go to work knowing I can see some employees I am friends with. The hardest part of the job is being alone since you have to be able to clean everything with good time efficiency and make sure everything is cleaned by the end of the day on time. It can be rather difficult when you have to serve lineups constantly. The best part I like about the job is meeting new faces everyday and developing my relationship with the team so we can work better together in the future.
good,"a typical day at work would be fast-paced with 1-2 breaks. Lunch could be optional. There's always something to do. Management is tolerable, they know what they're doing. Couple hiccups here and there. Hardest part of the job would be the time-management or heavy lifting. Best part is that the other employees are sociable and you can easily communicate with them to get the job done. Once you're out of high school it becomes a serious occupation, the grocery business doesn't mess around."
good,I worked in multiple areas of the store so there was a lot to learn and I loved that. I worked in the deli doing production 2 am shifts making all the cold and hot prepped food for Safeway's grab and go cases. I was in charge of temps for the store and calculating our wastes every morning. I also worked in our produce's new department the fresh cut room. Here I'd package fruits and veggies as well and cutting and preparing them.
good,A typical day at Safeway ESC was busy and fast paced. I learned to identify what caused problems that may occur with payroll and how and and where I needed to go to correct the mistakes.  Management was good but could be a bit unapproachable. The culture was enjoyable most of the time. I would say the hardest part of the job was lack of communication between management and subordinates.  Changes would occur and we would not be informed of them until the day of the change and we were the first point of contact for callers.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me was to be able to assist callers/employees with payroll issues and bring them to a successful conclusion.
good,"A typical day at work is usually busy, since it is retail, I learned how to handle different situations and apply different customer service techniques, the management was good, I never had any trouble switching shifts with anyone or making time to be at work, the workplace is a friendly environment, I enjoyed working with a lot of the people there, the hardest part of the job was getting carts, if it was really hot, or really cold, it made it difficult to get the carts inside in the snow but the job got done. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and talking to them, getting to know how their day was going."
good,Its a past paced environment with alot of customer service interaction this way you are able to learn how to be efficient with your time while still providing optimal customer service
good,"Overall was a good job. However the constant hours with just minimal experience and really early workouts was very fast paced for me to get used to. Whenever I started feeling like I was doing better, the other employees made me feel bad about how I was doing with my work experience."
good,"Love to work in safe way inc,like help customer,friendly with everyone,try sale to hit target and low shrink,love management this company,working hard and willing to learn"
good,Management  is excellent with employees.  Employee discount is a plus.  Work/Life Balance is excellent. Enjoy helping/serving customers.  I feel appreciated at work.
good,a typical day of work here would include checking customers out. the biggest thing I learned at this company was running a check-out stand and all of the different fruits and vegetables. the management was decent some of the higher ups could have an attitude when asking them for money change to give the customers their money back. the hardest part of the job for me was standing in one spot for 8 hours a day and not being able to move around often.
good,I enjoyed working at Safeway. The hours were decent and the tasks given were not impossible to complete. The managers were nice and the pay was well worth the time and effort.
good,My typical work day was different every time and I learned a lot over my two years there. The management was great and they made sure that you do your job and do it well. The hardest part of my job is multi tasking I was getting called for something what felt like every minute. The most enjoyable part of my job Is talking to customers.
good,"It was a fun place to work, and talk to other people. It helped me get an understanding of the job, and it allowed me to work in different areas occasionally when it was needed or asked for."
good,"I learned a lot at Safeway, mostly about costumer service. Greeting customers & making their time at Safeway a great experience. The managers are nice and they give us what we need and help us enjoy our time working here. The hardest part is dealing with people stealing here continuously. Most enjoyable part is when we have lunch ins in the breakroom for holidays and special ocations."
good,"This place was nothing but simple. Clock in out groceries on the shelf, ring up customers and go home. Management was chill and laid back very understanding and friendly. Only downfall was the new hires would quit after a week or two and puts the load on 4 or 5 guys at a time for a store that receives about 2500 pieces of freight on a heavy day."
good,I enjoy working for this company.Sometimes customers can be really rude with you for no reason at all but I overall love my job!!!!!
good,The deli team that I worked with was amazing and we worked together like a well oiled machine. Management could use some work though. My car broke down one day and the store manager told me that I better find a way to work.
good,I very much so enjoyed working at Safeway. Not only was the atmosphere great but as soon as I started working I felt very welcome. I would recommend Safeway to anyone.
good,"I really enjoyed coming into work, the management team was helpful and you could really be independent. The coworkers were amazing and really helpful and caring. The hardest part of the job was getting the closing work done while being short staffed. The most enjoyable part was dealing with the customers and working with my coworkers"
good,As the bookkeeper I made that the store funds were correct on a daily basis. in addition I also helped in providing breaks for the cashiers. The workers were great.
good,I enjoyed working for Safeway. A typical day at work consisted of bagging customers groceries and answering the phone. I learned a lot about proper food handling and safety. the management was great and I got along well with my coworkers and my boss. the most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to help people.
good,"Customer are a priority at Safeway.  You need to be able to curtail every interaction to each customer, and their specific needs.  Fun and fast-paced atmosphere."
good,"Overall my time has been great for the management is nice and understanding. The work environment I was put in especially nice as well. A typical day at work would be generally getting the product out to the customers as well as helping them with any discrepancies they may have. The hardest part would probably have to be the customers. sometimes they get a little antsy when you do not have the product they want. But otherwise, everything else is easy. My favorite part about my work is that I'm  in a nice little work area, it's easy to manage and it all to myself"
good,Working in an environment such as safeway is an opportunity to advance your skills and expand your horizons in life and in customer service ect.
good,I love interacting with customers and getting to know them. I also love that the customers love getting to know us (the employees).
good,i love learning about new products. meeting new co workers. my most enjoyable part of the jobs is working at your own pace.
good,"Typical days at work were simple, most of the tasks i was assigned were easy and quick. I learned how to operate a cash register, as well as increased exposure and practice in the customer service fields. Management was always positive and easy to get along with, however getting tough answers out of them proved difficult at times."
good,good company has a lot of benefits and really gives you a kick star to your career if your just beginning they pay for your basic and if you stay with them they will pay for your nccer
good,While the job has a steep learning curve the process is quick. Then you can settle in and really get to know everyone! The regularity of customers will quickly pull you in. You become an important part of people's lives.
good,"Worked on the floor w/customers and employees.Learned to order groceries,inventory,take care of the customers needs"
good,"Busy,phone ringing,people at both end of the counter needing service,insurance problems.The only thing safway could do better in our work environment is give more hours in the department for a clerk.Overall pretty good day in the pharmacy."
good,"I learned how to interact with customers and to serve their needs. I love helping customers in times of need. I am a people person. And it was always challenging because there was always something new I would be doing. New task, new customer."
good,Conservative company. Decent benefits.  Nice working environment. Good advancement opportunities. Great exposure to leadership and allows employees to be creative and express ideas and recommendations for better processes.
good,"Decent amount of red tape and politics, but with a big corporation that is expected. Good work place, and can grow within the company."
good,Safeway pharmacy was a fun work place with great pharmacist and stuff. I had a great opportunity to use my skills and also develop them. I learn a lot from our pharmacists and also from other stuff.
good,"Worked for Safeway for almost 30 years. Excellent benefits for old contract employees. Low labor hours made it hard to hit goals, but not impossible. You are given the tools to ultimately succeed."
good,I started as a courtesy clerk and finally was promoted to work in floral. I enjoyed working floral. My manager saw potential for another department I was interested in and  promoted me to a barista. I fit in quite well with the fast paced environment and enjoyed my job.
good,everybody was fun and not to mean but the only issue was that u did not get congratulated that much on how hard you work the hours were okay but the fact that they changed every week were hard to keep track and they don't offer to look at your schedule online.
good,"every employee was fun to work with "
good,"Many opportunities for advancement, through many different departments, in store or corporate. Vons offers extensive training to confirm each employee is set up for success."
good,"I've enjoyed my time with Safeway, and would have continue to work for this company.  However, due to the merger with Safeway and Albertson the Talent Acquisition department is being eliminated. Outside of that, the culture is very diverse and collaborative, and employees are encouraged to learn and grow.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working in an environment where your voiced is being heard, and employees are very supportive and believe in each other."
good,You will learn that great customer service is one of the most important part of working with the public. How to handle situations and understanding each customer's request.
good,"I face the department, work load or back stock. Stocking shelves is the most enjoyable part of the job. Having to work really early in the morning is the hardest part of the job. The coworkers are nice and easy to get along with. Management wants everything done perfectly."
good,"Managers are willing to work with my college schedule, and do not discriminate against students when a promotion comes along. I work with a great group of people that support me and are excited for me as I have hopes to getting a professional job after graduation."
good,"Customer support over the phone can be taxing.  Helping people was the best thing about the job, but some people can be very had to deal with due to the anonymity over the phone.  Coworkers support each other and managers were always open to ideas."
good,A typical day at work consists of nonstop customer service for the customers and making sure the store is organized and enjoyable.
good,Our goal is to be the first choice for those customers who have the opportunity to shop locally in a Safeway store
good,"costumer service skills"
good,This is my first and yet best job I've had so far. It raised the wages frequently. I built my confidence here and dealt with the customers everyday and loved it. I have to admit that This is very I got most of my experience in Customer Service.
good,"Safeway can be exampled as an everyday, ordinary supermarket, and in some cases it is but the company has enough individuality to it to call it something different."
good,"clock in for work. management there at all times some times two, half of the time. co-workers i knew because i went to school with most of them. i don't remember there being a hard part i was pretty much good with most of the objectives. the most enjoyable was when i was able to work in the bakery"
good,"Enjoyed going to work had a great staff, had many regular customers. Always busy, fast paced working enviroment."

This job gave me the opportunity to work with many different personalities, both co-workers and customers. My ability to adapt helped strengthen my customer service skills. The thing I enjoyed most about this job is that I was able to work with customers."
good,"Safeway is an easy company to get into but difficult to move up in unless you have the right connections. Management is being shaken up because they are not doing their jobs efficiently. I enjoy working with all sorts of people and most are nice and welcome me. (I float from store to store). The hardest part of my job is dealing with inconsiderate customers, but that is to be expected."
good,"•	Supervising night crew"
good,Management was friendly and always helped to make you better. Lots of learning opportunities. Friendly customers

This job has taught me patience, team work, how to think quick and hard about every choice I make to make sure is the best for my team, and my customers. I have had great managers who have always appreciated the hard work I put into the company and have always pushed me to look for more. I have gained the trust of my co-workers and they have always helped and stepped up to help me complete the job. It is very difficult going through days when a lot of problems arise with customers, or vendors or small and big problems but been able to tackle every problem and managing a store successfully is also the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Safeway is a great grocery store company.  It's slogan, ""Ingredients for Life"", not only applies to it's superior selection of outstanding products, but its focus on the treatment and values of its employees.

good,"good co-workers to work with, management went right from the bookbest part of the job was helping out the coustemers"
good,This is my favorite job. The managers and owner are laid back and are willing to help with anything you have questions about. The hardest part is dealing with angry customers. The best part is the co-workers and that you can be yourself.
good,"Started off as a cashier and worked my way up through the company. After carefully learning I was able to assist fellow employees as well as work in other departments if necessary. My last title was 'bookeeper."" I enjoyed learning new skills and being able to multitask.

good,working hard and making sure every customer i have an encounter with is satisfied with what are company could offer... i cleaned organized and stocked shelfves answered phones. i learned that the public can be fun to work with and i have met alot of interesting people along the way. All my co workers i treated with respect and kindness. The hardest part of my job was managing time to get all my task done through out the day becuase retail buisiness can be slow for one min and then get busy the next. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving know i did all the work i could and having are customers have a pleasant visit and left satisfied.
good,"Lots of positions to move between, great benefits with the union"
good,everyday u go in and have a schedule of things to do and had toaccomplish them by the time you had to go to the next. management was pretty good and co workers were excellent the hardest part the job was to get cart when it was grand opening in the heat. most enjoyable part was the co workers helped a lot and was like a family together.

good,The work pace was fast and consistent. I learned to provide quality customer service. The management was good due to the good communication my supervisors provided. My co-workers were easy to work with and very intelligible about the store and its products. The hardest part of the job was to learn the placement for all the products within the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all the employees.
good,"My job is a very busy job. You work with vendors all day. It maybe the Sales Representatives, a Merchandiser or a delivery Driver. I have learned that you must be able to communicate clearly with all that are involved including your store manager. Most of the co-workers are team players. You have those that aren't. The hardest part of my job is working in all types of weather conditions and preparing for inventory every six months. The part I most enjoy about my job is that I get to operate at my own pace and schedule."
good,"A day at work would be very repetitive, therefore it was a fairly easy job. At the same hour of every day you had to do the same thing as the day before. This job taught me responsibility and how to work with other people whether they be co-workers or customers. My manager was very strict and wanted everything done right the first time and for her employees to not be lazy. The hardest part of the job was being patient with customers who were rude and nagging but it taught me how to keep calm in situations and how to resolve conflicts. The most enjoyable part of the job was the wonderful people I worked with. There was not one person I did not get along with. We always had fun seeing each other at work and all became very close."

good,"every time i do have to go its hard to start the day but once your settled in its pretty fun and interesting always have to deal with customers, which most are not the best of people to be around with. i learn a lot from working at Safeway the hard work and taking your job seriously. the management are very straight forward they know how they want their store to be run. they don't always have to tell you what to do and you as the employee should know what to do without being asked. starting i will say is the hard part. the enjoyable part for me is when my shift is almost over or sometimes having good customer interactions."
good,everything was okay here could of been better.i learned alot form his job co-woker was okay as well
good,"It was fun, beneficial, and rewarding. Constant work, always busy."
good,It was a good leaning experience of what I would like and what is too much for me to learn it wasn’t my best job but it was also my first and I struggled a lot didn’t have much support especially since I had a disability and learning now how to disclose that but ya .
good,The company was bought out from another company . It’s been very different since and not for the good. As a employee I don’t feel appreciated by the company. I feel used and under pay. I lost my full time status cause I transfer to another store . Now it’s like I’m starting over again from the beginning and the company doesn’t care about my finances.
good,"I was actually sad when I had to quit this job,  my coworkers were all great management started cutting hours but only for newer employees, so seniority does count."
good,Great place to work always met new people and a few old friends. Management was great and gave me close to full-time hours even though I was part time.
good,"The work itself was never too much or anything difficult. Some days would be worse than others, depending on typical things like how busy it is, or if there were sick calls that day or not. The only thing that I didn't like about this job was the management. They would really take advantage of me sometimes. They would over work me or make me work a shift that I couldn't work, because everyone else would call in sick for the said shift. The only reason I left was because it started to interfere with my school and that is more important than the job to me."
good,"While at Safeway, I had great benefits and opportunities for growth. The work environment promotes strong teamwork and strong work ethic. Meeting customers needs is an important part of expectations."
good,Plenty of customer experience and entry level work to keep you busy while not being overwhelming. You get the occasional annoying or intolerable customer but they are just people you have to deal with.
good,"In my short time employed at Safeway I was given a two dollar an hour performance based raise, and offered a management position. The managers and corporate both took the time to assess, promote, advance and reward there best employees."
good,Its a amazing workplace to be in employes are very kind and incourgeing and always willing to take your skills to the next level and very clean enviorment
good,safe way is the kind kind of place you like to work at because they are friends and co workers the management are on the job to make sure everything gets done right

good,Good management in that they listen to employees and give kudos to good work done. Innovative technology used. Great benefits and training plans.great.
good,just follow the guidelines that the company has you promote pretty fast and they move you departments often. They also have some fun times where we were able to dress up like on Halloween and things like that
good,"I would clock in at the time that was designated and perform my job duties, breaks and lunches were scheduled accordingly. They took the time to train all employees so as they could do their job to the best of their abilities. They understood that family was important and did the best that they could to fulfill there requests for time off. The hardest part was the lack of hours that were given in a day to write a schedule for, and being able to make sure that we had enough coverage during all the rush hour of our work day. Even when we had to work holidays we mad it memorable, shifts were cut in half so everyone worked but everyone was also able to be at home with their family for the holiday. We we could a meal for everyone to enjoy throughout the day. No one likes to work the holidays but at least we felt appreciated when we had to."
good,"As a bakery clerk, there's definitely a lot of work that has to be done  as a team. The environment is quite fast paced and requires you to always be attentive to customers."
good,Learning the store and all the different items so you know how to show the customers were they are located. Learning all the codes in the produce department so you can be a good cashier.
good,"Safeway has a fairly decent training program. Being union you are taken care of with benefits, pay raises and promotions within. Every department has a manager which i had no problem with. Only downfall i had with this company was a asst store manager."

good,Most managers are caring and providing to your needs. your work is well recognized and it is a great place to move up in promotions when starting at entry level.
good,"Good training place you were always learning and preparing for best in class work place,preparation was all important. Food safety was express alot ,cutting meat ,displaying meat products was always a must do well job.the only set back was having more help and workers to come along and back you up.the benefits of the are good depending on how long you worked for the company."
good,Its a great place to work with plenty of room to grow. Co-workers are great and friendly. Customers can get on your nerves but hey its a grocery store so its going to happen. Team work is an important role because it will help the days go by faster and you'll be able to enjoy them.
good,"The organization was eventually bought out by another grocery retailer. However, the corporate side of the business was well established and fun to work for."
good,I enjoyed working at safeway the bosses treat me as a family. They also work alot of overtime which is good for some people like me who like to work and need the money.

That's what I enjoyed about Safeway. My co-workers were very helpful and respectful and very accountable. The hardest part of my job had to be the constant need of hours or maintaining 40hrs a week because of lack of hours given.
good,Great place to work. The company cares about their employees. The management is very professional. As office manager I provided excellent customer service. Co workers are like family.
good,Safeway always had a friendly environment everyday I worked there.  The management was easy to work with and they clearly taught me how to speak with customers and satisfy their needs in the best way possible. The hardest part of my job was learning where most of the items were in the store and the different varieties of each food. I think that the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have a good time with my co-workers when we had some time to talk and get to know each other.

good,"A typical day at work would be to help customers in a friendly manner and try to solve problems in a fast and easy way. What I learned about Safeway was that you need to work fast and efficiently in a fast paced environment. Management is not very understanding, but they manage to work with you if you show that you are useful. The hardest  part of the job is when there is long lines and you're trying your best to get the line moving. The most enjoyable part is getting to work with different people and get to know their culture."
good,"A cashier takes payments for merchandise from customers in a retail establishment. If selling items such as cigarettes and alcohol, he or she may be required to check for proof of legal age, such as an ID. A cashier also process returns and refunds. Since he or she is sometimes the first employee customers see when entering a business, a cashier usually has to greet them, answer their questions and respond to their complaints. Sometimes a cashier has other duties such as placing price tags on items, putting products on shelves and keeping the store organized and clean."

Since I've been with Safeway I've learned that my skills has progressed over the years and has helped me maintain a very good personal reputation. I've also learned to push myself passed the limits I have promised myself. Management at this job is good but can become better if the right push and supervision was given. My co-workers here are very well liked. They all have their special way to help the store meet the standards. The hardest part of this job is to maintain a safe environment for not only for yourself but for others as well. Its hard because of the location of the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is to see my regular customers come into my line and seeing them smile because I always approach them by their names and provide a speedy, efficient, and friendly service!"

My coworkers were very inviting the nice, they helped me out a lot! I think the most enjoyable part of my job is hearing great stories from new people and customers, getting to know new people every day and bringing a smile to people's faces. The hardest part was the carts for me."
good,This is a great company to work for. Find a store with a strong manager. Even if you work in a seperate department having a strong store manager sets the tone for the store. If you are looking for opportunity you can start at the bottom and make your way up. Good resources and due to the size of the company their HR processes are strong.

I've spoken to managers, and the union rep and nothing has been done for it. I've also been told that I was not allowed to call in sick, while in a union, and actively sick according to my manager. At my other store, after already getting everything I needed to be done, it took them two months to transfer me to a store that was close to my house.

good,A typical day at work is busy and rushing to get everything done in your hour. What I learned was that its hard to work with people that think they have the power and don't care about no one but them selfs. Management is ok the high management do there jobs but the people in charge when a manager is not there choice favorites and treat the rest like there trash. Some of my co-workers are nice and they ask me to help them when they need help but the rest are rude and only care about there friends and them selfs. The hardest part of the job is when u have to do carts because there really heavy and u have to finish and have non on the cart lots when its someone else turn do theres. The most enjoyable part of the job is when people thank me for me helping them and ask me to help them look for something or put there bags in there cars.

good,"Its a nice environment if you let it be. I grew up basically at that Safeway so it was easy to adapt to my surroundings. It has its drama, but its a nice place to work. I'd recommend it to anyone."
good,"Safeway I've always liked as their perishable departments are usually very good especially their meat department. Their house brands are all very good in quality and selection but Safeway tends to be higher in price. They usually run pretty good ads. I have moved where the nearest Safeway is 30 miles away and I miss Safeway. When I have to go that way near the Safeway, I always stop by as I still have my old Club card!"
good,"great if you have no other options or retirement job. not a great career. If you have the aptitude you will rise to a higher position. people friendly environment, helps to have a desire for detail."

good,"Typically, it would not be a boring day at work cause something is always going on and you're always busy with something.
