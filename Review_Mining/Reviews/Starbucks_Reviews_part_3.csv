rating,review
good,Very fast paced but fun. Always great partners. A lot of benefits to assist and improve the partners general life. Hours are unreliable and will change week to week with no consistent schedule.
good,It was a secondary job for me and I had a great time. Very fast paced work environment. This job requires attention to detail and if the management is poor then it snowballs.
good,This job taught me a lot about customer service. It also taught me alot about coffee culture. I worked there for 5 years. It was worth the experience.
good,"Starbucks is a harder job than it's led on to be - I don't think I've ever looked like such a madman as I did when I was on the floor. But, hard work does eventually pay off and I learned a lot from this company. If you can deal with the customers Starbucks Baristas deal with on a daily basis; you can deal with anything. The benefits are beautiful, and you can live off of the pay (although that has a lot of reason to do with why I left). Management can be a hit or miss depending on what store you're at, but Starbucks as a whole offers a lot of opportunity. Even if you're not satisfied with your 'home store', you can always try a transfer. It's not meant for everyone, and some partners definitely take it more seriously than others, but if you stick through it this job can make a lasting impression on your work ethic and your perspective of the workplace in general. There is definitely a reason why the Siren took three years of my life -- and I wouldn't take them back! I know this review makes me seem overly enthusiastic to potential coffee slingers, but don't get me wrong... the job is hard. Strenuous. Managers and customers alike can leave you in tears. It all boils down to who you have on your team. I would not discourage people to take this job on though, if anything it is definitely an experience."
good,Fast paced environment focused on creating a culture around the customer experience. Flexible scheduling with large and diverse benefits package for part-time and full-time employees.
good,It’s not that bad of a place to work at. it’s just not enough money an hour for how much work you actually do. It can be so fast paced that your whole body hurts or slow enough that you’ve got all your work done and ready to go home.
good,"Days would be busy with moments in the day where you could breath. Great coworkers and management that would look out for you. Was hired during the busy season, but employees and management were dedicated to training you during low traffic hours. Company offers good benefits including the opportunity to go to school. Mandatory  meet ups would be fun with food and drinks. Great place to make friends and hangout after work. Only problem I had were scheduling conflicts with management, and would have to call or speak with them more times than once; even when I wrote/updated my times of availability."
good,I enjoyed starbucks mostly because the people around me made it a workable enviorment. Can't say the free coffee wasnt bad though. It was a stressful place but also a place where going was easy.
good,"From the amazing benefits, both traditional and unorthodox, to the clear path upward, starbucKS is easily my recommended choice for a first job. They work with students at both the college and high school level. A more than competitive $9 an hour in adittion to weekly tip distribution makes starbucks amore thab competetive first job. Overall a great place to work."
good,"I am a people person and it was the perfect job to interact with people. In addition, they were flexible with my school schedule, which I appreciated."
good,As a manager it was busy all of the time. it can be hectic during rushes when understaffed. The culture is great and most people enjoy working there. The best part of the job is you get to drink coffee all day!
good,"I learned alot about myself and my capabilities working for Starbucks. I grew so much as a person and through the company. Starbucks offers a great work environment and culture for the baristas and customers. This job challenged me in so many ways, but has resulted in more growth during this period."
good,"The company as a whole has great values! I feel as if they care about their employers (partners, as they call them). It was easy to grow and be recognized within the company. It had stressful nights as any job would, but we worked as a team to get through all obstacles. I do feel as if some of the shift supervisor roles could have been filled by other people; however, the managers themselves were great and carin. The pay wasn’t enough to support living alone, but it is a great second job to have! They are very flexible with scheduling you."
good,"It was a great place to work and a fun working envornment, i enjoyed working with the people i did and connecting with customers! I was able to showcase my multi-tasking abilities in a workplace and shine as part of a leadership group."
good,"My manager was INCREDIBLE but incredibly over worked. The environment is hectic and fast paced and those with any issues with anxiety aren’t best suited for this company.  Over all, I enjoyed my experience but at the end of my shifts I was thoroughly exhausted. If you enjoy fast paced crazy work, you’ll love this job. There is always something for you to do."
good,I felt like every employee was like family. The managers were very educated and respectful. They always asked how I was and if I needed any help with anything at work
good,"If you like meeting new people and have the passion for coffee, Starbucks is the place for you. Starbucks is an awesome place to work at great people, great environment!"
good,"its a good entry level job. there is room for growth. The experience was good for me. Learning to make beverages and what it takes to be a barista, definitely helped me in my growth there. Overall, a great company to work for."
good,"Wonderful workplace culture, sets up rest of career in terms of brand representation and customer service very well. Interacting with different people every day but still managing to have meaningful interactions."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks because of the cultural environment it provided. It definitely is an experience walking into a Starbucks and getting a cut of coffee, and being a part of that experience is rewarding. I learned how to work as a team to complete tasks and developed helpful communication skills."
good,"The job itself is very stressful because of the amount of information they expect you to memorize as a new-hire. When it is during peak hours of the day is even more stressful because you are expected to make the drinks as efficiently as possible without lowering quality. However, after working there for a while, you start to get the hang of it. They provide great benefits and perks so it's worth the stress if you can handle it."
good,Starbucks is a great place to get started in the workforce or to finish your education. It is great for those who want to have a part time job outside of the house. They have great benefits and programs for part and full time employees. There is a lot of room for growth and advancements.
good,"Smart energetic people with a positive attitude.  Good work-life balance."
good,it was a great learning experience for me as to learn about customer services widely since it is a fast phase business environment. i learned a lot specially how to multitask.
good,"working at Starbucks is very demanding, i like the management and working in a small team helps your social skills and communication as listening to a specific order and making it exactly how the customer wants, there is something very satisfying in making someones day. a typical day at work is preparing the shop for customers, a lot of cleaning and making every moment right for the customers."
good,i have learned a lot during the time ive worked there. started of in the city and it was way busier than the bronx. the bronx doesnt have the greatest management though.
good,Starbucks has flexible schedules and good compensation packages. But the job is very high stress. Customers are demanding and the standards are high. It’s fun to be a part of something so popular . But it’s draining.
good,Everything was well organized and coworkers have good social skills. They train you well enough to where you have room to continue growing and learning.
good,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time with the company. While the pay is mediocre and the customer base tends to have a large mix of good and bad types, I have enjoyed the work itself and my coworkers."
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun but it's really hard work. Long hours on your feet, a lot of emotional labor to deal with customers angry outbursts, and minimum wage pay unless you are a supervisor. You can form really sweet friendships with your co-workers, but depending on the store, management can be good or bad. The company culture is very good and supportive but how that plays out in your store can depend on a lot of things. I worked opening shifts and peak shifts at a very busy drive-through store, so it was hectic, but closing shifts or mid shifts are usually more chill."
good,overall the workplace can be very stressful for new comers. I would not recommend this job to someone who gets stressed out very easily due to the high amount of customers walking in and out of the store. This job taught me many things from how to multitask and how to work in a fast paced environment.
good,"Starbucks is fast paced and it would always be busy, I learned how to be quick and to handle money. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers who would come in and I would like to have a conversation with them."
good,I've stayed with this company on and off for 6 years now because they take care of their employees and offer great benefits. I am always learning and improving with this company. I enjoy the constant opportunity for growth.
good,"would still be there if I could have gotten Sunday thru Friday 3rd shift , Good group of people to work with , and free coffee at breaks and lunch. Would go back if the right chance happened"
good,"Incredible customer service, make great customer connections, everyone is equal. I love working for Starbucks. The atmosphere is great and customers think so too."
good,"For those willing to grow in responsibility, Starbucks is a safe and wonderful environment. It provides a lot of video training in order to have the employees aware of any changes and it adopts a very supportive culture/atmosphere."
good,"Starbucks offers more benefits than many other minimum wage jobs. You make some great friendships and meet some interesting people. However, it can be a stressful job if you are someone who gets overwhelmed easily. You have to make drinks and warm up food all day while also smiling and greeting customers as they walk in and out. "
good,"Starbucks taught me the importance of both teamwork and multitasking.  The particular store I worked in was a drive thru, so you had to be able to carry on multiple conversations at once, while still performing your necessary job tasks.  Each and very day was different, however your team of coworkers can definitely make or break the job.  One of the best and worsts parts of the job had to be the customers.  While customers can be difficult to deal with in any setting, the regular clientele are definitely enjoyable.  Additionally, anybody from businessmen/women and stay at home parents to teenagers/students and all those in between are customers of Starbucks. You never know where networking with the right individual will land you career wise.  The company provides the ability to transfer to stores with locations globally (if you ever relocate for work. school, personal reasons, etc), and the benefits are great."
good,Great staff and good flow of business. work environment good and friendly staff. loved the smell and atmosphere of coffee. great benefits while working
good,Starbucks is most fun when both Baristas & Customers are able to have fun & create the best possible environment together cultivating a great experience.
good,"Starbucks is a company that lives the values it espouses. The employees are well-treated, the corporate system is successful, and the size of the company allows for benefits to both employees and customers."
good,"I loved working here, made lots of friends and was very close to my customers. I trained new employees and was really enjoying it until they changed the training protocol and reduced the amount of time each new partner got to be trained. I found they began to focus more on drive-thru times and sales rather than the happiness of their own employees. "
good,"Working for Starbucks, it has its benefits however it can be very draining and management doesn't always show appreciation for their partners, but will always ask for more."
good,"Starbucks is an awesome company to work for as a college student/young person. They provide some decent benefits and you can build lifelong friendships. The shifts available are awesome, especially if you take advantage of mornings. Overall, not a bad job. Not necessarily a place to stay though. I saw a lot of burnout with past partners."
good,"A typical day at work is making drinks and cash handling procedure. "
good,"Even without any prior experience in customer service before starting as a Barista in Starbucks, they quickly allowed me to showcase my quick ability to learn and adapt. While the training process only takes a week, or two, it was quite simple and easy to follow. The overall feeling of working as a Barista isn't as exciting as some might imagine, though that doesn't mean it wasn't a very helpful opportunity. The accumulate amount of time spent making drinks and servicing customers did help ease my mind in dealing with unexpected stressful scenarios. The upside to working at Starbucks is not only being able to learn way of making beverages, but making new friends and colleagues."
good,"Starbucks not only pays relatively well, but the work environment is challenging enough to push you and definitely not bore you, yet not so challenging as to result in frustration or burnout. The work environment is laid-back and friendly. The benefits are great as well."
good,"Starbucks has a really good start off pay and great benefits. Also they have a connection with ASU to help partners attend school and get their degree(s). Everyone is extremely nice and it is always fun to work there. They are very diverse and welcoming with open arms. The best part of the job is meeting everyone and having people who will support you, however, the hardest part is the fast past and at times learning how to approach and deal with difficult situations."
good,"Starbucks was a place were I can learn about coffee, how to handle the cashiers, how to be organice. Also how to talk with the costumers and give them what they need and working in a team"
good,"Great place to work (depending on your location, which makes a lot of the difference) with easy (albeit a lot of) tasks.. Its a lot to learn at first, but once you get the hang of it and get confident it gets VERY easy. It's nice to get to know your regular customers, and if you're like me you can constantly try to get better at bar (making drinks quickly) or serving customers.. or even multi tasking"
good,"Open scheduling due to being open from 4am-11PM, always open to work with schedules. I learned a lot about customer service. Management had its downfalls within the stores I was at. Hardest part about the job was being new learning all the drinks. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making connections with customers and other employees."
good,"loved working with the people at Starbucks, but it seemed that as soon as someone would move up from barista to supervisor they'd leave in under three months. This affected the workplace consistency and hampered barista's abilities to become comfortable with these supervising changes."
good,"reasonable hours, reasonable pay, reasonable job if you are a hard worker. All you have to do it make drinks and clean. depending on your position depends on whether or not you dealt with guests,"
good,"Great job especially if it's your first job, or looking for extra work.  Hard to maintain as an only job due to inconsistent hours and lower pay.  But frequent raises, just very small (ie, 10 cents/hr every 3-6 months)"
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work at also they offer you pretty amazing benefits, stocks, and school. I learned how to deal with people from all walks of like and patients. The hardest part of working at Starbucks is the people's high demand. Talking to people and getting to know them helps your mind grow and you gain experience in diversity."
good,"This job was amazing. I hated to leave, but when you hire a manager externally instead of hiring within your own ranks, its hard to for the manager to keep up, as well as your supervisors to work with a nice culture. The job may not pay as well as it needs to, but the friends you make and the regulars you meet are amazing. Plus, free drinks never hurt anyone!"
good,"Starbucks was my second job and was amazing. Making drinks for customers is always so fun and if you enjoy a fast paced environment this is definitely the job for you! I loved working at starbucks and would love to go back. I worked at one inside a grocery store which is why it wasn't always so great in my case. Less benefits, typically working alone. Would love to try it again in an actual corporate location!"
good,At Starbucks its a fast paced environment so you have to work very fast to server you customers. If you don't then you will have some unhappy customers.
good,"good place to work . enjoyed working as a team, good manager"
good,Starbucks requires you to work extremely fast paced and put up with some rude customers but it will teach you great patience and how to anticipate what your should do next. Management needs to fire the people that cause trouble for good people our ygood people will leave.
good,I learned various skills based upon the expectations of the Starbucks organization. It was a very fast paced experience. I learned to deal with customers who are friendly and who were unfriendly.
good,I worked at one while I was in the Navy it was the best hat of many i wore during that time. the most taxing part was carrying the milk up 4 flights of stairs
good,Its was a wounderfull inviting atmospher that lead me to be a better coustermer service repersentive and provided me with plenty of conections with people in the area
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for. It has given me opportunities to work in fast paced environment. It has challenged me on different aspects of the job. Learned a lot about the industry.
good,Loved the diversity of working with some many different amazing people. And had some pretty amazing managers too. Great company to grow with. They have free tuition reinbersment too.  Company strives in many ways to show there employees how much they are appreciated.
good,A typical day at work for me was first walking into the warm inviting aroma of dark coffee. Then I would order my coffee of choice to wake me up. When it was time for me to clock in I would get to work.
good,"It’s a very fast paced busy atmosphere especially if you works morning an it a race around the clock. Management could be better just like anyplace but I really fun. Instead of quitting all the way, I have a full time job and work there every other weekend to keep perks!"
good,Es un buen lugar para trabajar y poder desarrollar carrera. En lo personal una excelente experiencia laboral y para guardar en la vida en general.
good,"I will keep my review short, but overall I felt very comfortable with the company as someone in my 20's trying to get by in the world. Many opportunities for growth and an overall pleasant crowd to work with, upper management included."
good,I appreciated the management of Starbucks for its flexibility with regard to my student schedule at the time. I was never made to feel pressure to change my hours.
good,"Very good atmosphere for work, policies are very good, Hr is very active. Store manager and district manager help you to guide in your career. Two day week off"
good,great for any high school or college student to start off working. can meet new people and network. Managers will also show you the ropes to the business. your team members will also help you out to get everything a float
good,"Working at Starbucks was an overall unique opportunity to grow as a person and and hone a new skill, any new or returning barista should be proud to work there."
good,I loved working at starbucks. I also love working with a team and working at starbucks is all about working well with other people. The starbucks I worked at had flexible hours and worked well with everyones schedule.
good,A typical day consists of helping customers receive a quality beverage. I learned more about the drinks on the menu and how I can grow as a barista within this company. I loved the work environment and I would definitely recommend this job to others.
good,"It really depends on the store and region you work for. I worked in one state with a wonderful Starbucks family who had each and everyone's backs. It was a very positive environment to work for...until I transferred to another state and another store. This one was vile, it had a lot of favoritism and a lot of work related drama. Starbucks preaches to be a ""builder"" not a ""destroyer"" plus creating a 3rd home for people who enjoy coming in. That store in particular had none of those attributes therefore it was not worth my time working at. Especially for the pay rate. Yes we had a lot of benefits but because of the high expectations and standards the company set for themselves is not worth it. I'd suggest working for the company if you want to gain some experience of being a barista."
good,There is plenty of Starbucks culture that is prevalent in the DC.  The work is very challenging and there is plenty opportunities to prove yourself.  There is also plenty of opportunities for advancement.
good,"Its a good start up job when your a undergrad students seeking funds for college. I learned about different brands and regions of coffee that the company order from, made many hot and cold beverages, and had a great time working along side with the team."
good,"Easy money if u take the time to learn the steps and requirements. "
good,It was a great Environment everyone got alone it was a clean place until it got a new Manager that was rude and disrespectful and made everyone pay for his downfall
good,"I was working at restaurants from the age of 16-18 and was thrilled when Starbucks offered me a position. I got great experience working in a fast-paced environment and got the chance to connect with many great customers. The workplace is very relaxed, beside the high volume of orders of course! My favorite part of the job was the chance to make someone their (arguably) most important drink of the day, every day."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks in general. I was proud to tell people I worked there, I loved my coworkers, I loved many of our regular customers. The company allowed me to spoil customers as I saw fit which I loved and it helped build awesome relationships, which is one of the company's goals. They also promoted me twice in less than a year which felt amazing and empowering like I had never felt before. I felt appreciated by the company and recognized for my hard work and dedication."
good,"Es un trabajo que te permite divertirte y conocer a muchas personas."
good,The company culture was the best.  Very supportive and friendly.  Lots of $$ invested in partner growth and training- not just as an employee but also to make your a better person.
good,"Like most other jobs, your experience working at Starbucks will be primarily defined by your relationships with your coworkers and management. Even the longest, most intense rushes are bearable if your coworkers are friends."
good,There is an ebb and flow at Starbucks and you always have to be ready for the next wave. You have to have a head on a swivel and always be able to give top level customer service with a smile even when the customers act like animals you have to drive forward and not let it bother you.
good,"I've learned about managing the people and in charge of shift."
good,"Most customers come back because of the environment. It is a great place to work. For the most part, they do take care of their employees. The pay could be better though."
good,Every day at Starbucks was a day to remember whether  it was working with friends you met on the job or meeting the Starbucks regulars and asking how there days were going. The knowledge you gained from the workplace will help you through your entire life.
good,This company is very good at preparing people for life experience. It focuses on time management and development. The pay is poor but benefits are good.
good,Working there was fun especially the crew mates you work with.The downside was the pay I got from them. When I worked in california it was 9 dollars an hour. When i moved to Utah they dropped it to 7.50
good,"working at Starbucks is a great experience, it definitely helps with customer service and fast-paced efficiency skills. Depending on where you work depends on how your experience will be. You have the ability to transfer given a good reason, but what is also good is you are able to work at different locations within the district if you are not getting enough hours."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work at, but it can be a little crazy most of the time.  The stores are always busy and short staffed. Many people just want a job and they don’t care about calling in sick all the time."
good,The benefits were good and the work hours were flexible. Opportunity to work at different stores in different neighborhoods. Tips were good dependent on the store.
good,During a shift the day would have its highs and its lows. During Starbucks peak hours the shift would be busy and fast paced with expectations too perform to the best of your ability while being careful and precise with making drinks. During the slow times during the shift you are expected to maintain cleanliness of the store and designated stations while restocking.
good,"While I can’t say that an entry level position will pay the inflated rents of my area, you do learn a lot and there are commonly opportunities to move up in the company. I’m finally ready to move into my field of study, but I love everyone here and all but the earliest of days make me want to keep coming back."
good,"My experience at SB has been very mixed. I've met wonderful people through the job and it's a joy making drinks and connections with customers every day but it's also pretty taxing. You're on your feet the entirety of your shift, and are expected to always give customer's special attention, regardless of how busy you may be. Unless you are in management, you will usually work less than 6 hours which means you do not get a 30 minute break and are only offered a 10. At my first SB location, we were understaffed nearly every day, requiring you to take on multiple positions on your own, which is EXTREMELY stressful. They push drive through times to be super low but also expect you to make connections with every interaction, which is almost impossible to do."
good,"Starbucks was very upfront and forward with its work, you show up, clock in, and get to work. It was pretty easy once you got the hang of it. With my time there, my coworkers were very supportive and helped me along as I learned. Overall, it was a good time."
good,"Fun, just have to deal with rude costumers on occasion. Decent training is done, just not a whole lot of room for making more money or working your way up."
good,"Every location is very different. It's a mixed bag. Some partners are very diligent, but the job also attracts people that are not really hard workers and can bring a whole team down. So it really depends."
good,Good working environment with lots of benefits. Didn't feel that my compensation was enough to live off of exclusively. I enjoyed the fast paced working environment.
good,"Company takes good care of its employees, with competitive pay and benefits that far exceed most entry level server/retail opportunities.  Only downside is dealing with the occasional negative costumer, but that is more of a rarity than a regularity."
good,Overall Starbucks is a fun and exciting place to work. I loved the feeling of creating happiness in someones day when I handed them their daily order and it always brought a smile to my face when I saw my co-workers. With that being said my manager was to controlling and made working their quite miserable.
good,As long as you are friendly with the customers and are helpful towards your coworkers you will be fine. I had a hard time at my first location because I was surrounded by young people who wanted to bend the rules. My last location was much better but the manager need help holding people accountable.
good,It was my first job. It was right some of the employes should have let go because they did not work at all because we had too many people on staff. But on busy days everyone was needed.
good,"I liked working here for the most part. At my particular location most of the people worked there for a long time and customers were 80% regulars. It definitely took time to be accepted into the click. There’s a lot of stuff in the training that doesn’t prepare you for day to day, but after 2 months I felt pretty comfortable. I enjoyed the fast paced environment but they are very strict with labour costs so during peak hours it would get stressful. this job will help you learn how to interact will all types of people. I used to get anxious or overwhelmed easily and this job helped me get over it. Starbucks is a great place to work it prepares you for any customer service industry."
good,As long as you work hard and try to help customers working at Starbucks is fairly easy. Quite a bit of favoritism. Although it didn't directly affect me I could see that it negatively and unjustly affected a couple of my fellow partners.
good,My experience in Starbucks was amazing. Everybody worked as a team and would always get the job done. Problems were solved at the level that they had to be handle. Managers were aware of every employee and if anyone needed something they made sure they had it. As a barista I don't think there was nothing hard about the job. The key to always having a great day was to always put a smile and the day would go by smoother.
good,"Your coworkers and how you portray yourself really makes or breaks working at Starbucks. Definitely get to know your coworkers well because they're the people who you ""hang out"" with on the job. Fast-paced environment with room for improvement. Fun job, but don't slack."
good,Great place to work people are nice and atmosphere is awesome. Very faced paced environment and always have to be on your A game and very detailed oriented.
good,"It was a nice change from cashier to barista! I love working with the people I work with and like that their are chances to grow with the company! They are also very flexible with my availability, as I have a very busy life outside of work!"
good,"The typical work day can rage for early morning to later in the afternoon, either having to deal with morning rush or afternoon peak. I have learned that most people really need their coffee and can't function without it."
good,"I couldn’t do this job full time again but it’s a brilliant part time job and is perfect if you’re a student. It pays really well, and the staff are brilliant, it’s like a little family. The management is fair, but as I mentioned I couldn’t do this job full time again as it’s really hard going (super early mornings and late finishes, very busy days on your feet with small breaks, stressful environment)."
good,"Has a lot of benefits and growth opportunity, overall it's the most tolerable customer service job I've ever worked. I dont think I'll stay here my entire career though due to some frustrations I have with how corporate makes decisions for the retail level that makes it obvious that the people who make the decisions have never worked in a retail store. They also need to hire less outside people for store management roles."
good,"A typical day at work consists of working at the register for the first 3 months. After you are comfortable with that, you will start making drinks. "
good,"Pros: "
good,"At first when I started working at Starbucks it was difficult dealing and remembering where each drink was located on the register. After I've mastered the register it was the bar next, learning how to make the drinks. Overall it took me 1 month to mastered cashier, being on bar and customer support. Quick, simple, and mostly relaxed."
good,"The work itself is typical for a coffee shop, in my store we're usually staffed up enough that we have no problem making it through peak hours when the line is to the door.  My coworkers are my favorite part about my job, everyone works well together and all of my coworkers are very supportive and quick to recognize each other for a job well done, they consistently make me feel valued.  The worst part of the job on the other hand would have to be the negativity from customers, a hand full of regulars are very nice and I do enjoy seeing them on a regular basis, but there are also the regular customers that are rude to you no matter what that puts a bit of a downer on things..."
good,Great company. Good benefits. Difficult attendance and management policies. Quick to fire without consideration for extenuating circumstances. Hope to get another chance.
good,"Overall one of my favourite jobs, it brought me out of my shell and i met some amazing people. Working at Starbucks is never a dull moment. From the constantly changing menu and the numerous types of customers its never boring."
good,"Enjoyable atmosphere to work in, if you’re a fan of fast paced environments. As long as you keep a cool head, you’ll be fine whenever a rush comes. The coworkers and customers you have can definitely make or break the experience, so always try your best to socialize. Also the free drinks were amazing, they definitely came in handy."
good,"Especially on campus, there are a lot of students. It makes no rest at all. But you have to control your body energy so that you can keep working all day."
good,They are willing to work with you and they are open. Maybe employees could be given a little more time to open in the morning. But every one usually works well together
good,"Starbucks is an excellent place to work if you are fast paced, good with people, and enjoy being around food and coffee. I personally liked the early start (morning shifts), the relationships I developed with regular customers, and the knowledge I was able to acquire on coffee, which I enjoy more than most."
good,"I learned how to interact ans socialize with not only with customers but my fellow coworkers. Team work, customer satisfaction and memory skills are used everyday."
good,"It was very busy, and almost always short staffed, but it was a nice and close group of workers. The managers were very understanding and did their best to assist in the front of house because they understood how hectic the day could get. There were some long hours, but you were always compensated, though your feet were sure to ache the next day."
good,"a typical day at Starbucks is really not that bad. Always busy I can say. The customers take the coffee really serious there & I learned a lot about the background of the company & why coffee is so important since I been there. it's really interesting. My Store GM is very understanding and tries her best to work around everyone schedule so that's cool. The hardest part I would say about this job is learning how to make the coffee drinks at the bar & all the combos it goes with, AND TRUST ME ITS A LOT! they even got a secret menu.  Besides that, I enjoy the people that come into the store and how much the company cares about there workers. that's dope to me. Also, you never know who you meet inside the store! I have seen a couple of famous faces in my store already. I enjoy the job but if you're not hitting at least 30 hours a week. that check looks kind of weak but ""aye, a job is a job"" and I had worst, so I'm cool with the opportunity of working there."
good,"Didn't work there too long because I had to move back home to Wisconsin for family issues. within the short 2 months, I liked it a lot. great learning environment. great co-workers and overall good experience."
good,"Stable employment but paid low, decent benefits, opportunities to advance for young, ambitious people.  Very fast-paced and too much required for multi-tasking to be effective."
good,Starbucks paids for my college! Overall the pay isn’t terrific but the benefits if you take advantage outweigh the compensation! Enroll in your stocks
good,"This job can get busy, but you learn to grow and work together with others and it flies by quickly. The more time spent learning, the easier it is. It can be a lot for those who suffer from anxiety, but management will do their best to work and grow with you. If you put in the time, they will help you."
good,"The culture of Starbucks is really the defining feature of employment. You're brought in as an immediate member of the team. I think some people may feel nervous to ""drink the Kool-Aid"" of corporate culture, but Starbucks really sets itself apart as a company that does the best it can for their employees and the communities they serve."
good,"A bit tiring but fun, great workmates asnd an understanding manager. Customers give good tips. the one-hour break is a nice thing and also the free meal."
good,"Worked at Starbucks for around a year, the opportunities to progress were great and the team were incredible. Relocation meant I moved away and therefore left but the opportunities to progress within the company were definitely available at the time. Enjoyed my time there."
good,"Love the atmosphere and the job advancement opportunities available to employees. I love the great customer service that everyone is committed to. Overall, a great job."
good,"I've experienced the best and the worst concerning management. At worst, I have seen a manager's employment terminated because of how she treated her employees in front of customers. At best, and presently, I am working for a calm and approachable manager who does things by the book. I've worked with many partners and what I can say is that with good communication, the team will be strong and happy. The benefits are amazing, but the pay doesn't seem to acknowledge the amount of our physical exertion."
good,"Coworkers consistently left work for other people at my initial location, but overall it was a hardworking team. It's not a horrible environment, but it isn't fantastic. It's a good job, and has great benefits, if you can get lucky enough to have some great coworkers, that's really a plus."
good,Productive and nice people. Good characters there very fun environment. Star bucks made it feel like home to its customers and employees. Gave a lot of opportunities.
good,"It was a fun environment, even though it was fast paced it was still very laid back. Making the drinks became satisfying after you learn how to make them."
good,"It was great getting to know and build relationships with the regular customers. The management was typically good, but there seemed to be a high turnover rate of managers which made it hard to build relationships with them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the relatively high rate of new employees coming in and leaving but as previously mentioned, the relationships built between myself and the customers was the best part of the job."
good,"This job has taught me good communication skills with customer, moving rapidly because it is a fast pace job. Motivating people, planning, making decisions, and problem solving."
good,"Very fast paced work place, can be hectic at times, but still able to provide good quality service as well as good customer connection and keep a good attitude."
good,"The company is good for pay and progression. The only problem is management like to have favourites and they are the ones that get to progress without giving the others a chance."
good,Good option for people who have just started their career. The task is fairly basic and easy to pick up. My co-workers are very friendly and fun to work with.
good,Overall it’s a great place they do give u opportunities to move up  and the benefits are good. They have a good school program if you are interested in going back to school. Great people and management is awesome.
good,stressful but fun. would recommend working here if you love making drinks and have great team work skills. If you and you're co-workers aren't on the same page it will be a nightmare working here.
good,"Learned a lot about managing people and business.  Great benefits."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work at for a couple of years. I was a barista, so during my shifts, I would make coffee, work at the register, as well as clean around the store."
good,Working at Starbucks isn't for the light-hearted you will leave with a great work ethic if you take heed to the lesson they will teach you. The attention and expectations for customer service are exceptional and quite frankly to the highest standard that I have ever experienced ironically.
good,"8 hour shifts, always making beverages, cleaning, stocking up, register work, talking to customers and taking care of orders. Most enjoyable is the the coworkers I get to work with."
good,"I worked at Starbucks temporarily during the summer season (I am a college student). I learned how to make a wide variety of drinks, as well as how to brew coffee in more ways than one. I also had very friendly co-workers that made me feel right at home."
good,great job for those who want a better paying job with good benefits. I recommend this company to many new to the work force or those in school. Great flexible schedule.
good,"It get's busy, sometimes there wasn't enough resources but our managers made it work. Management allowed too many callouts, short staffed closing nights."
good,"Overall, I loved Starbucks. The only thing I would change is the salary. You can’t really make a living off $10/ hour as a supervisor. It’s definitely a great college job, especially with all the benefits they have to offer. It’s hit or miss with the managers. One manager I had was great, another was okay, and the next was awful. Very rude and played favorites. I would still be with Starbucks if they paid better!"
good,They rather promote from within the company. They are all about the partners. Also taking of the customers one at a time. Going the extra step just to get to know someone.
good,"getting a chance to know different people, getting a chance to grow and have lots of new knowledge when it comes to business. Had fun working with my team."
good,"I had a manager who had issues with closing when I worked there & was unable to get things done. Other than that it was a really fun job for me! I was taught how to interact well with the customers who would come in & able to keep a positive attitude. It was lovely getting fed, having a free Spotify account & the benefit of having coffee on hand!"
good,"it is a great place to work. Work-life balance is great. The only problem might be management. Besides that, it is agreat experience and a lovely place to work."
good,Often we were under staffed in peak hours but the team I had working with me were amazing and hardworking who went above and beyond for their guest and although we stayed busy there smile never changed.
good,my overall day was good there  as i got lot of experience there and the workplace was very familiar . including that the management was also very good there .
good,"Working at Starbucks has a lot of benefits. You get free drinks 30 minutes before, during, and after work. The workers and customers are very friendly."
good,"I enjoyed the morning shift because it was calm before the storm. Able to enjoy the crew getting the store set up for our customers and staff. I loved learning the amount of work goes into a cup of coffee, besides the ordering. The journey to different parts of the country before working at Starbucks was fun and amazing. But learning more in depth and the stories too, was nice to hear and show that when we make our coffee for the customers. I enjoyed the locals that came in and the new faces that I didn't see growing up in Helena. My biggest challenges were the very picky customers and they would continue to find my faults because they can't admit their own mistakes. I know the customer is always right but sometimes I believe they chose to go out just to cause issues. How we could help each other as the rush comes through. Granite we're not California or D.C. but we did keep up and push ourselves to be successful."
good,"Loved working for such an amazing company."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company. I have enjoyed all of my time there while being challenged to express time management, hard work, and kindness. It has been a very rewarding employment for myself."
good,"I enjoyed working here overall. What I love most about the company is their focus on customer connections. This was a huge part of my training and I can really appreciate it even now. "
good,"manager treated me well, fast paced, taught me a lot. liked my coworkers they make things fun when its stressful. we got together for a meeting when the incident with boys getting kicked out of a Starbucks had occurred. it was nice that it was discussed and they closed stores for it."
good,"A typical work day includes opening the store and preparing the products to be sold when customers arrive. During store hours cashiers manage the transaction systems, baristas control product out put while supporting roles make sure the store is clean and stocked at all times to ensure quality customer experiences."
good,It was a great stepping stone to where I want to end up. It gave me the basics of how to provide great customer service and time management. Would highly recommend
good,"Not much to say about the job itself. Come in and make drinks, clean up the store then clock out. I liked all of my coworkers and management was understanding with any issues."
good,"The atmosphere in Starbucks is very professional. In there, you will never stop learning, everyday is a learning day, you will always find yourself that there is something that you have to work on and improve. Your team will compliment you when you done something great and will give you reinforcing feedback when something went wrong."
good,"A typical day is about routine and being able to maximize your time on the clock. Fast-paced environment with a multitude of procedures. Teamwork is key to success. Will build a relationship with other partners (co-workers) quickly or will not last long. There is a steep learning curve when first starting but can work in auto-pilot mode once you become experienced in a variety of roles. "
good,"During my time I learned a lot of growth, gained knowledge of how a franchise operates. Flexible hours and an understanding family of team members, always felt welcomed."
good,"This place was fun to work at because of the environment and the many people you get to meet, also you get breaks with unlimited amount of free drinks and a piece of food as well"
good,"The benefits of working at Starbucks are really good, being able to have full time benefits while working part-time was amazing. I learned a lot about the customer experience and making every moment right. There are however issues with being scheduled full-time hours while not being a full-time employee."
good,"Overall, it was a great place to work. It's definitely not a place I would work for the rest of my life, as it is not enough pay to support a living in the US."
good,Got great experience regarding professional work. Got so many skills and experience. Work with experienced person that helps you to grow more in futute.
good,Buen trabajo y tienes derecho a varias bebidas en el día
good,Rate of pay does not match responsibilities of a shift lead/ tenure of partner. They get away with it with the awesome benefits. Make it hard to think you'll find a better job elsewhere
good,I worked flexible hours. My managers understood school was my priority. The menu is relatively easy to learn. Recipe cards are provided and there is plenty of literature to reference if you are ever unsure of anything. I was able to move up to a lead position and I enjoyed the change in responsibilities.
good,I was hired to open a new location initially. I was sent to a different store to be trained while the new store was still under construction. I really enjoyed working there but the new store had a lot of kinks and some of the people were hard to work with. I quit because the manager said he was unable to work with my school schedule even though he knew I was a full time student when I was hired. Very fast paced but once you are trained it isn't to stressful.
good,Great place to work on your people/ customer service skills. Learn new skills like drink making. Dive deeper into the world of coffee by becoming a coffee Master.
good,"Great benefits"
good,Hardest part about Starbucks was making the customers coffee how they wanted it once it was already made. They would either yell at you or throw the whole coffee away and talk badly about you. The people I worked it made it easier and were very helpful as well.
good,"It is a good first job or temporary job to get familiar with a routine and to save up some money. I does not however, make for a good income for living in San Diego."
good,It was hard because the people there are very competitive and can sometimes be pretty rude but i really enjoyed making drinks and the busy productive work environment
good,"Starbucks was my very first job and I absolutely loved it. It was a fun and exciting atmosphere. I learned so much about myself, my work ethics, character and how to manage. My coworkers were the best part. I loved making drinks and meeting new people. My manager and district manager were so supportive and listened to our needs. Some things were challenging but open communication was key and it helped a lot."
good,"I loved making people's day by making their first cup of coffee to help them go through their day. Management wasn't as genuine as it could've been, actions speak louder than words."
good,The company was hreat to work for. My store disnt have a lot of hours because if renovation so i need a new job. A lot of benafits. Great people work there.
good,"very engaging to work in, and its not to harsh on you when you're learning all the roles of the business. you're not stuck into one position either or one location. if you need hours you can pick them up at various locations. hardest part of the job is learning the ratios for the recipes. each size has its own recipe for each drink."
good,"Se le celebra de manera amplia los conocimientos de café, se busca que descubras el gusto por el producto."
good,I enjoyed it until a new manager came then I barely got hours. Then things started to not be as they used to. So much changed. But I would check I out the location you work at first .
good,"I enjoyed most of my time at Starbucks, it was an enjoyable if stressful year. Most of my issues came with schedule management or some of the working conditions for someone with food allergies."
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced job that has an emphasis on quality and efficiency during peak hours. However it is not a job for those that don't wish to climb the ranks. Apart from memorizing different drink orders and aiding guests with their inquiries, it has no true motivation, or at least not at my location to improve on oneself. My favorite part of the job was the connections that I formed with my fellow employees and my customers. My least favorite part was just having to blindly follow a manager that didn't necessarily perform the duties set to them."
good,a typical day for me at starbucks was working hard getting to know my customers and their favorite drink so when they come in the next time I won't have to ask I would already know what they drink is . When my customers come in they are happy to see me because I make them feel welcomed and I'm always laughing smiling and communicating with them while making their drink of the day . The workplace culture is amazing everyone getting along and enjoying the time making drinks and talking with customers . The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my customers smiling and coming back for me only to make their drink. the hardest part is a rude customer but I will still do my job and smile. I learned many skills a day and it made me grow even more as a person.
good,This job is great because it got me socializing with members of the community and it was fast paced! I definitely recommend working here at least once in your lifetime because there are a lot of benefits!
good,"It was the most hectic job I've ever had, extremely nerve-wracking. Felt like I should be getting paid more for the amount of stress and work that I had to do, but getting tips wasn't too bad. Was upsetting though when I quit my other job and then Starbucks cut my hours so I had to go get a second job somewhere else. They wanted me to be constantly available for them but only give me 2 shifts a week, it was ridiculous. I mean if you like active jobs then go for it, but go to work at one that has hours readily available for you."
good,I worked along some great individuals and got to meet great customers. I enjoyed learning how to make different drinks and food for the customers. It was a lot of fun.
good,"great place to meet like minded people, easy to advance if you put in the effort, amazing benefits, truly truly amazing benefits for an 18- 21 year olds ( or anyone for that matter), make use of the benefits and the stock that they give you, its really worth it in the end. I learned so many useful skills."
good,kinda stressful just because of the pace of all of it. The customers expect they're coffe fast but wont quit down enough for us to hear they're order. Other than that it really is a fun place to work.
good,"Starbucks is very great job, especially if you’re not a lazy kind of worker and want to stay busy. It also takes a lot of patience. If exceed those very few qualities I would apply !"
good,"Corporations are evil and Starbucks is no exception, but they are considerably less evil than others. Overall not a bad place to work. Really good benefits for working only 20 hours a week. Tuition reimbursement through Arizona State, free coffee and food during the work day, a discount, health/dental/vision."
good,"It can be pretty fast-paced and there is not a lot of down time so, if you're someone who doesn't do well in that kind of environment I wouldn't recommend it for you. The people that work there are pretty cool and the benefits can be really good as well."
good,"This job contributes to Starbucks success by assisting the store manager in executing store operations during scheduled shifts. This job deploys partners and delegates tasks so that partners can create and maintain the Starbucks Experience for our customers. The incumbent is responsible for modeling and acting in"
good,Worked for Starbucks for 5 years. It was my first job and was great in helping me learn about coffee and the structure of the company. The perks are also a major plus.
good,"You go in start your shift. I started out serving coffee then moved my way to cashier, you circle around every hour to different stations. next would be the food station, then the barista station."
good,"Being a barista at Starbucks can be an incredibly rewarding job, filled with fun and music and coffee and friendship. however it is also extremely demanding both mentally and physically, depending on the location you work at. Morning rushes can see hundreds of people through the store per hour, which means the occasional burn and grumpy customer need to be met with a smile. At the end of the day, you have to remember that it's just bean juice, and your pals have got your back."
good,"It is a fun place to work while you are in school. They pay more then minimum wage and will work with your school schedule or other life obligations. This job is completely equal to how well the store is run. So if you are considering applying somewhere, check the reviews and go from there. Anything under 4/5 stars is probably not worth working at. There will always be negative reviews but customers can generally sense how well the store is run. Great store manager=great experience and vice versa. It is fast paced, hard on your body, mentally demanding, but it can be very worth it. Customers and co-workers can be great."
good,"There are rush periods throughout the day, but there is some time to slow down and clean the store. During the slow times, it was common to talk with co-workers or single customers. There is a learning curve for creating the drinks, but you can get to a good speed within a few months. Management was off as there were not enough supervisors there. There were also not enough baristas there which made scheduling sometimes difficult."
good,Good company to work for. If you do not like change then it is not for you as there is always something changing. You meet tons of people from different backgrounds daily. The team is also built with numerous people from different backgrounds who often have 2nd jobs or careers they are doing. Overall a good place to work.
good,I worked here during my college years and for the most part everyone was chill. The space was a bit small which did lead to a crowding issue and was frustrating especially during a rush. The worst part about it would be manager issues but overall it was a good experience.
good,"Good job for a younger employee. But for an adult liking for a career it would lack many things. Limited benefits, and just over minimum wage. Tips totaled to $30-$40 per week. And there are basically 3 positions in the entire place so unless you go corporate, there is little room for advancement. However, if you're just looking for experience, income, or a part time job while in school, it can be a great place to work."
good,"The Starbucks I worked at was an excellent place to work until the ""substitute store manager"" (primary SM went on her wedding vacation for a month and they needed a temporary replacement) cut my hours and sent me home for acrylic nails that I had no idea were not allowed during shift. She also had me on my hands and knees scrubbing the baseboards behind the counter claiming ""what if the customers see all this filth?!"" (Firstly, the customers shouldn't have seen anyways and secondly the mop got most of the dirt, there was just a bit between the wall and the safe). Other than that, it was fast paced but it was a lot of fun. Starbucks as a company was very team oriented and very people friendly. You could always expect at least 2 rushes on any given day, the breakfast rush that happened from about 9 am - 11 am and then the lunch rush started at about 1 pm and typically ended around 3 or 4 pm. The hardest part of the job was probably when there were multiple customers and there were fewer workers than usual because then all of us had to work double time and typically had to fill multiple responsibilities at once."
good,"If you enjoy working in a fast environment that requires you to constantly be on your feet this is a great start for you! Working mornings gets hectic as everyone hits the morning coffee rush. Of course its super fun to learn about all different coffee roasts and how to hone you barista skills, but never forget you cannot succeed without a great team. Everyone working together on the same page makes a huge difference. Also you will not go one day without some type of negative customer interaction. You will never please every single customer and a good attitude goes a long way. Its all about keeping your cool in stressful situations, after all it is a company that is hugely favoring happy customers, even if that means you let them take advantage of the system unfairly. Hardest part of the supervisor title is dealing with unhappy customers and the stress of an unhappy team that is constantly overworked. The company is constantly changing and it seems as though more and more is expected in so little time. Great pay. Great benefits. Flexible schedule. Biggest complaint is the stress of extremely rude customers, the constant misuse of public cafes and restrooms, and frequently feeling overworked."
good,"Great environment  to work, definitely enjoyed working with everyone had some awesome management. Benefits was great i honestly have no major complaints."
good,A Cool fun place to work. The pay could be better but no other job is like it and everyone that works there is fun to be around and makes the job better and the benefits and drinks are awesome.
good,"Great place to work"
good,"I had a wonderful manager at my location, as well as great co-workers. My hours were flexible and I was able to work my schedule around my school requirements. The hardest part was opening the kiosk after a day when someone did not have the chance to clean and prepare everything for the next day. The best part was the ability to clean and organize during a closing shift."
good,"I enjoyed working and making drinks during rush hours, i love being busy and I always was busy. The only dislike was the drama other team members tried to get me involved in."
good,"I equate Starbucks to being like having a luxury apartment  with lots of amenities.  Starbucks offers a great deal of benefits but has a fairly low wage, which I  believe is in part to fund the benefits.  It is similar to a luxury apartment with amenities in that if you don't use the amenities, you are just paying too much  for an apartment, or at worst paying for other people's use of the amenities.  At Starbucks, if you aren't aware or using any benefits, the stress of the job is not worth the pay, especially considering the only way to make more money is to climb the leadership ladder, at which point you lose flexibility.  My only wish is to add periodic assessments for lower level employees so those who don't wish to rise in the company might receive an extra incentive for their longevity with the company."
good,Managers and coworkers are outgoing and willing to help you succeed. The hardest part of the job was memorizing recipes. The most rewarding part of the job was building customer relations.
good,"Starbucks is nice to work for and they have good benefits, depending on the manager it could be very challenging air times and sometime corporate doesn't really care about what you have going on"
good,"It was a great experience after sometime with Starbucks. I began as a Barista and then was promoted to Supervisor and then to Assistant Manager and finally Store Manager. "
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for. It is a fast pace, and busy environment that keeps me on my toes. You can move up in management quickly as well"
good,"Starbucks was a great place for advancing skills in a quick paced, high-stress environment. Unfortunately, the main manager of the store was terrible at balancing their work life and social life which made the already difficult job even more so. But there was a lovely staff and great customers which helped the day go along smoothly."
good,"I work in the morning most of my shift, working there is friendly and relaxed but you have to work at a fast pace. You have an 30 minutes if break per shift and the cool thing is that you can make as much as drink as you want for free while you're at work."
good,"Great company to start out with as you grow."
good,Starbucks is a really cool company to work for. It is very fast paced and there is much to learn but once you get the gist of things it’s very fun. I would definitely work there again.
good,"My time with the company was filled with ups and downs. The company is excellent at adapting to customer needs, but that requirement for agility can become daunting and even disheartening at times."
good,It is nice if you like dynamic environment and if you like to meet new people every day. It is perfect job for a student but not if you are supporting a family. Can be hard in the begining because you have to learn so many things for very short time (how to make all drinks and the codes on the cups as well as the custom items). Probably the first day you gonna read books about health and safety (is normal) but after you pass the first week you shold feel better. Most of the people working there are friendly and very helpful.
good,"Working at Starbucks has sort of a learning curve, you have to learn and memorize a good amount, keep track of a lot while working. When it's not busy however, work can be relaxed, but there are often rushes or busy times where you have to be on your feet and manage a lot around you. They are good about breaks and considerate with scheduling, just the amount of work can be a lot for a job that pays just a little over minimum wage."
good,Starbucks is an amazing place to work that is easy to get hours at and works you very hard! you will learn a lot but morning shifts are usually 4-5am or even earlier wake ups. also your coworkers play a huge part in making your life easy or not.
good,"Alsea como tal te da buenos beneficos."
good,Working for Starbucks has been a great experience I would recommend it as a great fun place to work. I have learned great food safety policies. Great place to connect with customers and build new relationships.
good,"Great place to work. Good benefits for employees, good work life balance. Exemplary training, policies and procedure. Great management team and room for advancement"
good,"Starbucks can be fast paced at times and you are constantly needed to use good customer service, you are needed to remember all the drinks and to keep moving or the line is gonna get backed up"
good,"I started for starbucks by being interviewed and then trained in Hawaii. It was relaxing, beautiful and took a week to complete allowing a relaxed and helpful learning atmosphere with hands on learning, tasting and company history."
good,each day is going to present itself with challenges you will learn to handle whether its with a customer or staff relations. the employees are willing to help with any concerns you have
good,"Loved working at Starbucks, worked while in college. Worked full time. Had great benefits. Lots of training and learning. Room for advancement through the company."
good,"we are always busy especially in our store because we are open 24 hours, we have a bunch of regular guest from our building because our building is full of call center agents. i learned to be fast paced especially in our busy hours, handle customer complaints because i was assigned in our cashier and i learned to be disciplined in every aspect of work."
good,"Working for Starbucks is so much more than just serving cake and coffee; it requires the ability to remember ALL the drinks (and the countless variations) available as well as maintaining a friendly and professional manner at all times."
good,Amazing place to work. Great Team members  (Partners) Willingness to train and build skills to keep employees. Having Rules that not all employees were required to follow.
good,"Stressful , I learned how to deal with very difficult people and how to maintain a great attitude no matter the situation. Management helped in whatever way possible that they could"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you want to grow and develop as a professional. Most of the managers I've encountered place high importance on exposing their direct reports to new opportunities and help employees (called partners in Starbucks) find mentors. There's no shortage of community and development activities that enable partners to focus on something other than their day-to-day. Starbucks also has a very inclusive work environment and is generally a very friendly place to work. That said, there are challenges with management in this company. Some things Starbucks could improve upon: prioritize partners for promotion based on job merits, not on personal connections;"
good,"i had a great experience working at Starbucks, everyone is very friendly and they give you the best training to make the drinks and explain everything."
good,Was able to do my hours and not think baout work while I applied for grdauate school. Hours were flexible and the culture at my store was pretty cool.
good,Starbucks is a fast paced environment. It has progressive company ideals and is very flexible.  It can have a good atmosphere. It is challenging   It is a good position.
good,Starbucks on a college campus is very busy and the workspace is super small. It can be so stressful. Having a good manager to calm you down and feel better can you really change things. My manager also offered us a 'minute' when things got too stressful. It really helped calm us down and for us to get back to work efficiently.
good,"For the most part, I experienced excellent teamwork along with a good manangement experience. The schedule was accommodative to everyday life obligations and was very flexible."
good,I started in a grocery store then I decided to maneuver to a retail store so that I could learn a faster pace and have a possibility in becoming a maanger.
good,"Probably one of the best customer service jobs out there. The company provides pretty low pay, but benefits and discounts/markouts even it out. Transferring is easy, so I always had job security even when I was moving all over. Morale heavily depends on management. Some stores are fantastic, some are terrible, it's really down to the supervisors."
good,fun always keep you busy create a third home for customers very flexible with employees scheduling opportunities to move up in the company there is never a dull moment
good,Starbucks was a fast paced work environment with lots of different responsibilities including recipe memorization as well as extremely focused on customer service and satisfaction.
good,It was a great place to work good benefits cant remember the benefits because it was so long ago back when I first came back from college. The environment was good nice relax fast paces to work at the customer are friendly and sweet they love to buy other customers coffee it would be like the car in the drive thru would pay the car behind he\she and it would continue to go on and on.
good,I believe Starbucks is an amazing first place to work at. I also believe that after a while you begin to tired of the turnover and you are required to take on more and more tasks with no increase in pay. High-level managers rarely listen to the needs of the stores. Starbucks is family oriented and I have made many long lasting friends there.
good,"I had this job for less than a year after high school. From what I can remember, the job was fine, customers sucked, and my manager was awesome. good benefits."
good,Lots of young people to work with and lots of interesting customers. Learn a lot about starbucks culture and drink making. Very good team atmosphere. :)
good,Great Job. Very fast paced. And it Always keeps you on your feet. Could use aome changes with training and scheduling (at the time I was there. But overall good job.
good,"For someone fresh out of high school, going to college, or a parent looking for good health insurance, Starbucks is a stable place to work for. They offer a number of benefits and have partnered with Arizona State University to provide 4 years of college to their employees free of charge."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks because of the people you work with and the culture they create. However, the pay is not nearly what employees deserve. I had to wake up at 3am to go to work, and it was nonstop busy the entire time. At no point while working there did I make more than 50 cents over minimum wage. And the tips do not make up for that. Long, exhausting hours for poor compensation. The benefits are nice and being around coffee was wonderful, which is why I stayed so long. But it gets extremely tiring after a few years."
good,Coffee is the core of Starbucks which its culture was built and maintain around this fantastic coffee culture. Everyone is friendly and works toward business goals.
good,"I enjoyed working there, it was a great part time job that allowed me to get health insurance while I was looking for a more permanent solution and could have worked towards career advancement if I wanted to within.  Benefits were great.  Pay was less than desired and if you were in a bad location, tips were bad at the mall and it affected how much you were used to getting if you were at a different location."
good,The most enjoyable are the people and making your own drinks lol. Everyday is different the only thing thats the same is opening and closing you have things that you have to do. Management is okay but being on time is stressed alot. I didn't work there to long because although its a great college student job. I could not survive off the pay given.
good,"The worst part of the job is the stress of handling the morning rush. Our rush hit around 7AM and kept going until 10AM. Our entire house was moving with each employee stationed at specific spots: oven, cashier, two bar, and sometimes when it was really bad we would have a designated hot bar and cold bar employee: 2 people on hot drinks and one person on cold drinks. Starbucks teaches you how to work as a team in order to steamroll that morning rush. My typical day started at 3AM: I was the opener. Being an opener is rough and honestly Starbucks should compensate Openers more considering that 3:30AM shifts until 10AM is technically a night shift. Management was great, they really worked with emergencies and school schedules.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when it was slow and you had time to talk with customers or provide a little extra love into a drink for your favorite regular. Also, it was cool to be apart of someone else's morning ritual."
good,"Your time and enjoyment at Starbucks will honestly really depends on your manager and how organized they are.  Starbucks is one of the only food/service corporations that offer medical, dental, vision, life, stock options, and 401k options.  It can be stressful but the company itself is pretty good.  If you need insurance, or are just starting out, or need a part-time job, I would definitely recommend Starbucks."
good,"Essentially, if you take the time and effort to work cooperatively with your coworkers and to build a relationship with the clientele at the store, then you can truly appreciate your role in the company and the difference you make in each customer's day/life."
good,"Starbucks was such a great place to work. "
good,"I enjoy my job day-to-day and while I do not take advantage of all the benefits offered to partners, I do take part in stocks and utilize my 401k with the matching program. This is valuable especially since anyone can partake."
good,"I highly recommend this company. Starbucks truly cares about its partners and wants to see them succeed. That said, partners need to be invested in the success of the company to see growth and advancement."
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for. I loved my time there, and have become really good friends with almost all of my coworkers. I think it's a great place to get experience and I've been grateful for the opportunity. The only downside is once you reach a certain level there's very little opportunity for growth which is the only reason why I'm leaving."
good,"Starbucks was a very fast paced, competitive work place, but also very fun. The crew at all stores I've worked at value hard work and humor. This builds cohesion and friendship quickly."
good,I enjoy working here. A typical day at work is intricately planned and usually goes smoothly even during rush hour. Management really cares about their employees.
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Starbucks, It could be pretty fast paced at times but still enjoyable. The managers were also really flexible and willing to help if they could."
good,yea it was chill chiull chillin good good i liked it alot it qwas fun stressful alot of work but it barelyt paid bills its was whatever good 2nd or 3rd job
good,"This job creates relationships that last a lifetime. Between co-workers & customers, I have friends until this day. It takes no longer than a month to completely get a hang of the job & thats the hardest part. Once you understand what you are doing it becomes a breeze. You can often find ways to keep yourself busy & entertained which makes your eight hour shift feel more like three."
good,I had been employed before but I must say that if you are just starting out in your working career this is a great start. There is room for career advancement if you desire but handling the irrate customers here with a straight face and simply bringing smiles to caffeine addicts faces is enough of a reward.
good,"Starbucks keeps up the pace according to the area you are located in. I worked at a high volume store, which means I had the opportunity to experience a fast paced environment, but with that pace comes high stress, as well as an opportunity to grow much quicker than slower stores. You are quite stressed in the moment, but as you progress it becomes a fun challenge, so if your looking to be kept on your toes and encounter non life threatening challenge, then Starbucks is the place for you. I as well enjoy the equal opportunity for anyone that needs a job to help pay off debt or for someone who needs something to do now that they are retired. I enjoy the willingness to work with your own schedule and the variety of people you encounter. Like any job dealing with entitled people you do receive the backlash of negative feed back, but in the end it helps build a tough outer shell and a balanced perspective on your work ethics and abilities."
good,"Starbucks is great if you love comporate America. They really do have some great programs to help out their ""partners"", as well as some impressive health benefits for part-timers, which is pretty much unheard of elsewhere. I would recommend Starbucks to anyone that's just starting out or getting back into working with the public. It's a good experience that will really solidify whether or not you want to continue working with public as far as customer service. The biggest detractor that I found while working at Starbucks was the management. I worked at about 5-6 different stores and each each one had similar symptoms of favoritism and it always felt very ""clickie"". So finding a store that you ""fit in"" at can be hard and not always worth it. But it's a heck of a lot better than most other entry level position in the industry, I can't deny that for a second. Also, who doesn't love coffee?"
good,"My very first work experience is under this Company. Almost all of the basic skills that I learned as a Barista I've learned with Starbucks."
good,"Starbucks is great but unfortunately, the management at my store forced me to leave. My manager was very sexist and a big bully and our district manager was unwilling to do anything about it."
good,The location was fast paced and very busy in the mornings and afternoons. Co workers were fun but sometimes lazy and not motivated. Manager took things too personal.
good,"It is a pretty chill job, lots of great people. It can be stressful during rush times and drink promotions especially if there isnt enough staff on. It was fun to learn how to make all the drinks."
good,Great place for teamwork and collaboration and good career progressions if you start as a Barista. Once the stores were franchised off the standards and working conditions really plummeted.
good,"I don't like reviewing jobs, a job is a job- if it makes you happy then cool beans; if not find yourself another one. But this job is very LGBT friendly"
good,"They want to care for their employees because the benefits are awesome but the pay almost doesn't make it worth it. Baristas start at minimum, whatever the state wants. Shifts make a dollar or two more. Partners and managers are great to work with. Just wish the company stepped their game up. Starbucks comes up with crazy rules to get more customers in the door and stay because our customer connection sucks. Well it wouldn't suck if the employees were happy! We need to get paid then we'll be more than happy to suck up to customers."
good,"it was very fast paced but I really enjoyed all the people that I worked with and I enjoyed meeting customers who became my regulars. even though it was fast paced, it was a challenging an fun"
good,Great work environment with consistent learning great incentives for partner offer work life balance as well opportunity to continue your education at ASU. Leadership team is involved in partner growth and gives partners ability to create a career . As a manager I was able to lead a team of over 20 partners to support the delivery of our customer service experience expectations
good,"very fun, i loved it. hardest part was probably cleaning the mats but other than that a good work environment. Management was great with me, worked with my life and school schedule."
good,"If you enjoy high volume and constant work on your feet for 5-8 hours, Starbucks could be perfect for you. Although I don't think the pay is full compensation for how much work you have to do, but there are many extra benefits. The work culture highly depends on the location you're at"
good,"I really enjoyed working there, after the manager left I just didn't like the acting supervisor. I would love to go back, they have great benefits to all employees."
good,"A very good place to work, especially for your first job. I was able to learn many skills, such as a using a cash register, operating a driver thru window and quickly making drinks."
good,"I enjoy working at this company. Their mission statement is at the core of what they do, and it drives all of the employees to make each and every day the most of what it can be."
good,"dealing with customers "
good,"The free drinks are great and they have a lot of resources for partners to learn and grow from. Sadly, not everyone is aware of this information and they form habits that are not to the standard"
good,You can learn a vast number of skills through SBux but be prepared depending on your location to work your butt off. A good thing to make your experience at Starbucks a good one is to bond with your coworkers.
good,"Besides the stress of working at a mall, the work environment was friendly and collaborative. The space itself was very cramp so I would not recommend working at a mall starbucks compared to a cafe."
good,The flexibility of work schedule is great but the pay is not enough for the amount of work you have to do.  There is no way to support yourself with this job.  It is good if you live with parents and need a free education!
good,"The Barista position was primarily fast-paced depending on the shift you work, the mornings are typically the busiest and the nights are usually slower. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment that consisted of making drinks, this forced me to collaborate with my co-workers which made it much easier to make drinks. The customers will push you to work harder, so you must keep a calm demeanor at all times."
good,"Working at Starbucks can be rewarding and fun as long as the supervisors and manager are understanding and flexible. It is a great environment if a culture of camaraderie and continuous improvement is emphasized. A manager or supervisor that expects too much or carries themselves as a boss rather than a leader can ruin store morale quickly. It is an easy going job with periods of high stress and fast paced work that can be made better or worse by management. I left because management changed for the worse and despite working with both the new manager as well as the district leader, change for the better was not in sight and I needed to move on."
good,"To be completely honest the job environment was awesome. However, the cost of living to pay ratio, especially for now hard baristas are being worked isn't fair."
good,"Just make sure your on time for work, check in, and have your hands cleaned and ready to grind up some coffee!!! and remember to say goodmorning because you never know...you might makes someones day :)"
good,"good staff"
good,"I enjoyed my time at the Starbucks corporation because I was able to hone customer service skills that I can bring to any job. The store I worked at was very organizes, my coworkers were professional yet friendly, and I was able to learn new barista skills. I recommend working at Starbucks to anyone that is calm under pressure."
good,"I worked part time, they are very flexible with school. Great opportunities for advancement and further education. Starbucks ensures each barista follows the mission and values. Hardest part was when there was a rush of middle schoolers & they all wanted frappucinos. ;) Really not a stressful job. Great job to have while in school!"
good,"There are very few opportunities for people striving for work/life balance to be able to promote within the company, but you do get to work with a great group of diverse individuals."
good,Great place to work for a first time job. It builds character and your customer service skills. Been with Starbucks for 8 years and gained so much experience.
good,great environment and place to work. The discounts and benefits are a big plus. The environment is somewhat relaxed and  enjoyable. The work can be face-paced at times but not terrible.
good,"Peoples opinions will very but i highly enjoyed the fast pace environment, being able to connect to the customers and learning about coffee along side some fun co workers. I would go back and i would recommend it to others."
good,I had a great team when I first started but with new management everything changed. Always greeted customers with a great attitude and sent them out the door with an even better one.
good,I was able to have a job and have a life which was best for me while I worked there. The culture of the job stayed with me through the jobs I had there after as well. Will always think fondly of my time there.
good,Off-site management team needs more in-store experience before releasing promotions and sales so they know exactly how their promotions operate in-store.
good,"I learned about coffee production, taste, and culture. It allows you to begin with no coffee knowledge at all and they educate you and provide opportunities for tasting."
good,"It was a bit stressful, but was fun. Work hours are very flexible, and people are very chill. At times you have no customers and all you do is clean when you are not working with customers."
good,Starbucks was and is my favorite company based on culture and and consistency. Benefits were outstanding and the job was always fun placed in an even more exciting working environment.
good,"It was a fun place to work, love the regulars. Only down side was management. No real training. Breaks were often skipped on due to under staffing...."
good,"A typical day consist of making sure customers get great service and their drink is correct. Either if you are on register or making drinks you have to deliver great service to each customer. Overall, workplace culture was great down to each customer."
good,"Starbucks was a good place to work. Though frustrating at times, the employees and management usually make it worth while. The benefits offered are also hard to beat."
good,"The customers make you love your job the most, I loved how their moods would just become so joyous by tasting their beverages. It showed me how well I did my job."
good,Its good experience. Everyone should some experience working in a face pace environment so you know how to work under pressure. But it can exciting if you like it.
good,its fun and busy depending on the location you work at. only down side about it is that its limited hours so if your looking for only one job to work fulltime this probably isnt the best
good,I loved working at my Starbucks! My co-workers were all pretty great and the customers were very easy to get along with. Management was spotty at best but can be dealt with if you keep on task and get your work done.
good,"Provides great benefits, yearly raises, and a flexible work schedule for anyone but is great for students. Once you have worked with Starbucks for a length of time, they give you stock grants for free."
good,"It's a very good job to learn a strong work ethic at. There is always something to do, whether its customer or task oriented. It teaches you to handle a lot on the fly. Most customers are great to serve and staff enjoyable to work with. You'll most likely make friends working here, both staff and customers. I learned a lot working for this company."
good,"There are some issues with management at my store, but in all, I was very welcomed and I work with amazing people. The job is very fun too, except for cleaning."
good,"My experience with Starbucks was a blast. If you're able to maintain your cool under a high pressure environment, then look no further. Starbucks provides a friendly environment with good benefits as well."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you need a flexible schedule. Store managers have always been accommodating to the scheduling needs of their baristas."
good,"Some workers are used to not having to do their job and still getting paid. Basic things like cleaning or not standing around waiting for customers to come in and gossiping in front of customers is an ongoing issue for partners who worked under the previous management team; and not much can be done in terms of discipline. Overall Starbucks to be a very good choice, very easy to get promoted and travel upwards in the company. The pay is great and they have amazing benefits. If you don't have enough hours in your store you can very easily phantom at another location. Great conversations happen here, you get to have personal connections with customer and seeing them everyday becomes apart of your routine. However, depending on which location you're at, if you have to deal with constant drug use, or violent people coming into the store on a regular basis there's not much management is willing/ can do."
good,"as a barista, a lot is expected from you. you're pretty much doing everything except managerial stuff. it may seem stressful from the constant quick pacing, but with staying as a barista for a long time, comes many benefits, from discounts, to paying for colleges. it's the perfect job for any hard-working young person"
good,Every task is usually laid out in front of you. There are moments of being overwhelmed but they pass. generally a nice company to work with but the pay isn't great.
good,"I recommend Starbucks as a good second job or a job that works with your schedule while going to school. Other than that, it's too stressful and does not pay enough and therefore does not make a good long-term job."
good,People in there have really positive mind sets. I think the hardest thing in Starbucks were pallet building. But other then having an  Exhausted day I liked that job.
good,"The customers are just that, customers in a fast food establishment. The management tries their best to control what goes in and out of the work environment in a respectful  and unbiased manner; but the true shine is in the co-workers."
good,had a good time working. I learned how to do drinks and satisfy customer needs. made a lot of connections and gave a lot of smiles to everyone around me. hardest part of the job was trying to multitask in a fast environment
good,Overall a great starter company to work for with many benefits. My particular store was riddled with homeless people witch made it a bit stressful .I have taken shifts at other stores and the shift went very smooth and fun.
good,"Good company just needs to focus less on nonsense book work and allow for more customer focus. The company is very good at offering incentives, good benefits."
good,"Starbucks has a fast-paced environment. You need to be quick on your feet whilst taking care of the orders, helping customers, helping the employees, maintaining a clean atmosphere, and preparing the morning and evening cleaning routines. The hardest part of the job usually happens when the staff is low and many responsibilities is handed to few employees. In these cases since the time of open and close is specified, many tasks need to be done before certain time. The most enjoyable part is the team work and all the workers. The Starbucks culture is like a family where everybody is welcomed."
good,Assisting the store manager in executing store operations during scheduled shifts. Deploys partners and delegated tasks so that partners can create and maintain the Starbucks Experience for our customers.
good,Good company to work for if your willing to put in the time to advance in the company. Promotions take awhile but if your patient its a good job. The hours are short because they dont hire alot of people to work full time.
good,I loved working at Starbucks. The staff is great the customers are fun. The energy is high it's a thrid home for me. The benefits are great and the pay plus tips are encouraging.
good,"Pros: Great work culture. Understanding and friendly partners. Diverse environment. Equal opportunity to grow. "
good,Starbucks was a great work environment and the staff was treated very well. They pay slightly higher than similar establishments and provide benefits to employees as well. Overall I have great memories about my time spent working at Starbucks
good,"Starbucks has a fast pace nature. You want to give a customer a correct drink as fast as you can, because most of the time you are making the drink that is making them a happier person."
good,"A typical day was me coming in at 4:30am and opening the store and making customer orders. I learned all of the drink recipes and I kept learning the new recipes as time went on.  Management at my store was not very good. The manager gossiped about coworkers and was very negative towards a lot of the employees. She took a lot of things personally and made peoples lives miserable if she didn't like them. Toward the end some coworkers and I were getting our hours cut so badly that we barely worked. Aside from the management everything is amazing! The workplace culture is fantastic! Everyone is really nice and gets along really well. It gave us a chance to bond as coworkers and as individuals. The hardest part of the job is the early hours, how fast paced it is and you also have to multitask all the time. The best part of the job was connecting with the customers and creating an amazing experience for them that set the tone for the rest of their day."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for young people. Flexible with school schedules and social life, free Spotify, 401k matching, stock options, and tips to take home roughly once a week. -"
good,"I loved my job but there was no raises for merit. There was just a 2% raise every 6 months, which is just a few cents per hour and does not make a noticeable difference."
good,"100% open availability if going into management.  Working there when I was in high school and in college was great.  However, as I was promoted into management, the schedule was no longer flexible.  Great benefits regardless."
good,"Good place to work, fast paced environment, sometimes stressful. but you build good strong relationships with your team. The hardest part of the job is learning out to deal with some tough customers."
good,Ambiente comodo gentil con gente humilde y comodo bienestar
good,it was a pleasent enviroment to work very busy work place i learned how to have more patients  with costomers and to just keep GOT on my mind all the time great offer and thank
good,"I had fun working for starbucks but being in a customer facing roll can be taxing. you have to  be on your game at all times, and if the store isnt busy you are kept busy by cleaning the establishment. other than that it is a fun atmosphere given the right type of management"
good,Working for Starbucks has literally been life changing over the last 3 years that I have been with them. Being able to grow as a partner and work while I was finishing my college degree was the best thing that could have happened in my life. Working there has helped me grow in my personal life as well.
good,fast traffic but fun environment. work can be hectic sometimes but the fast traffic makes it go by so much faster. Dress code is awesome it allows you to come to work with your own style
good,Great place for your first job in the food service industry.  You will be taken care of as far as health care and basic needs but the wages are still not enough to live on even if you work full time.
good,"Considering the stress level of this job, the pay is not worth it. However, the benefits are good. This is a great job for many people who need flexibility or are just starting out in the job market. The culture at work was great. You really bond with your coworkers. I worked at numerous locations and experienced this at all of them. It is hard work, but often fun."
good,"For most of my time with Starbucks, it was a pretty good job.  Fast paced, fun work for the most part, good coworkers - again, for the most part.  But once I started getting to the point where I was actively trying to get promoted and running into a lack of job openings higher up, it started to become frustrating."
good,"Working for Starbucks was something very memorable. I honestly believe that it is a job of a lifetime, and if you can keep up with the fast paced life style, this job is perfect. It broadened my love for coffee and early mornings."
good,"Yes, yes. The customer is always right. Yes, yes, the customers are rude and horrible people. Yes, yes, its a minimum wage/entry level job."
good,"Its a great job but not much for a career, every hard to advance unless your favored by someone. It has its perks like other jobs do, but pay isn't that great. Free Lunch and Free Drinks.Weekly free pound of coffee, stock options"
good,"I worked in one of the stores, and ultimately my satisfaction with my job came down to the management team at that store or for the district.  Starbucks as a company is great; they have fantastic benefits, I loved the culture, there's room to grow within the company, and flexible scheduling is nice.  However, if you have a bad management team the environment can quickly turn toxic without much opportunity to make it better."
good,My first starbucks to work at I lived... We were like a mini family and we all cared about one another and were willing to help one another out. Not the second starbucks I worked at. The manager sucked and left her crew feeling like we had to walk on egg shells around her when she wasnt doing her job properly and got repremanded by her boss. If she was having a bad day nobody could have a good day.
good,"During a normal shift you learn a lot about teamwork and time management, the hardest part of the job is when you first get there and don't know how to make the drinks but once you get the basics you are golden as far as making drinks now prepping for the next drink and time management is up to how you do it, and the best part of the job is that everyone there knows they are a team so everyone is there to help you when you need it."
good,"I work at a Store in Palm Springs, Ca. High volume store for 15 consecutive years, same store. When a tall coffee was $1.50. I love my job. I love my customers. With how busy we get and how we get talked to by some customers because they just wanna be rude is sometimes not worth the pay to be be-littled. Don't get me wrong, I could handle it in a professional way but some can't and will cry in the back room. We need to be appreciated more. Benefits are great but sometimes that doesn't make up for all the stuff we go through. Its mentally and physically draining. Considering I have carpal tunnel diagnose because of work. Which Starbucks covers and thats great. We need to get paid more with how we hustle. We are what makes Starbucks.  .30-.40 cent raise a year isn't just worth it. I couldve left don't get me wrong, but I stay because I have grown attached to partners and customers. Great job if you need benefits, but there are other jobs out there that u can get better pay/raises from. If the CEO reads this or someone above... Should really recognize the partners that have been with the company for a long period of time instead of a plaque and wow points that equal $250. A good raise would be great.."
good,"The training when you first start was in my opinion, really good. It was focused and organized and made sure we knew everything about Starbucks drinks before we were allowed on the register which helped a lot. The majority of my other coworkers had a really good work ethic compared to others which made the working day better. Management had its pros and cons but the majority of our supervisors always showed that they cared about us and would help out frequently."
good,"Starbucks is a company that allows people to be themselves, flexing (within reason) to each person's needs.  It's a company that actually lives the mission statement, which is fairly rare in my experience."
good,I loved working in this fast paced environment where it was easy to work on and improve my skills. I learned how to take care of a customers needs and make a great cup of coffee.
good,"The work was fast paced, accidents were prone to happen due to spilled drinks, some customers are rude if coffee or other drinks is not prepared their way. Aside from that the pay is good and they offer great benefits"
good,"I truly enjoyed working there between the new friends i made and "
good,"You can only be as fast as your slowest partner. Working in a fast paced food service, what you would expect. The customers can be great or can make you want to quit your job."
good,"My work days were always something to look forward too. I don't even know were to start with what I've learned because I learned so much. Let's start with being more confident with myself and my skills. Leaving my comfort zone and being more of a people's person. The multicultural awareness was amazing, everyone is very understanding towards your background or story. I can't really think of a hard time with the other then the first week, just trying to figure everything out. My most enjoyable part of the job is making other people smile and just knowing that I played a part in making their day great."
good,"Excellent training system and corporate culture with team building values embedded in everyone of them. The only downside was the benefits, though it made up in the brand recognition and reputation when switching to different company."
good,As long as you have a good working team and great manager this is a great place to work. It's fun to learn how to work and operate flowingly under stress and business
good,Buena forma de trabajo en equipo. Horarios ajustados a las necesidades.
good,"This was a great part time job but with personal issues with my family, I needed to be home.  I miss my customers, and some of my co-workers.  This job makes you learn how to multi-task."
good,"Starbucks takes great care of their partners. Very thorough training and diversity is celebrated. Great benefits, even for part time partners. Fast-paced, fun company to work for."
good,"It’s a great job with fantastic benefits for both short term hires and long term hires. Each partner is encouraged to create a welcoming environment for not only the customers, but for each other. The company prides itself on community and gives partners oppertunities to volunteer through work programs and helping local organizations."
good,"Good benefits, opportunity to move up, great culture."
good,"It's your basic Starbucks...which can be a good thing (consistency, readily available locations) or a not-so-hot thing (sometimes not as good as a small independent coffee shop). It works. I got my coffee and people were nice. It's easy to miss if you're driving though."
good,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time working at Starbucks through Mohegan Sun. My only wish is I could have worked for corporate sStarbucks. Every day is pretty crazy and stressful. Long shifts and short breaks. Bad GM"
good,"It usually depends on your coworkers and the location, but my location, luckily, has been pretty nice. There are a few hiccups here and there due to some customers and the occasional coworker, but for the most part I’ve had a pretty positive experience."
good,"Nice customer and team"
good,Had the chance to meet many interesting people. Learnt quite a bit about the coffee world and culture. Great work environment. Whole company is focused on completing goals.
good,"starbucks is a fun work environment, can be stressful at times when it is busy but its a great place to work. Always making new friendships which is a plus"
good,"It is a good place to work it promotes teamwork and pleasant atmosphere, however atmosphere can vary wildly depending on location and staff at the location as well as management, the typical work day is not overly complicated or hard after a brief learning period. However hours can vary wildly if you are not a manager from my experience and your benefits do rely on the amount of hours you work of which you are not guaranteed. Overall i would say it is a pleasant place to work with great learning opportunities, though hour stability is lacking"
good,I enjoy  working at this job a lot. The people and environment are very welcoming and fun to be a part of! I love making connections and getting to know the regular customers on a more personal level as well as well as a business level.
good,"had fun enjoyed it but no room to move up , management needs a lot of work they do not help anyone out and ask for more and more every single day with out welling to help out"
good,Good place to work but they support and fund Monsanto and GMOs. That's all I have to write here but need to take up more space. I guess they also helped me with a grant when it flooded in the Rockys.
good,"A lot of life-long connections and great opportunity for a first job in high school through college. Great benefits, lots of cleaning and multitasking but overall a good start to a hard work ethic."
good,"It sometimes feels like those making decisions have never worked customer service/retail jobs, but they do try to listen to employees. All the stores I worked at had great employees."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for especially if you have multiple jobs, or go to school. They are very flexible and have many great benefits. I would say the only downside is the hourly pay is very low, and when you do get a raise it is only a few cents. Definitely hard to survive if your a one income household."
good,"Learned great communication skills and leadership skills"
good,A typical work day included keeping products stocked up and making sure the kiosk was constantly kept clean. Friendly and quick customer service is a must.
good,"I love coffee and engaging with others. This is the perfect place for both. You get to explore your love for coffee, and bring other team members and customers along the way!"
good,Starbucks is a great company overall but I think we should be paid better for the things we have to go through with the customers on a daily basis other than that it is great.
good,"I loved working as a barista! It was fast paced and always full of surprises. The hardest part was dealing with the rush of customers, but it was also very polarized and exciting. The cutlure of the work place was like being a part of the best team! I shared a close bond with all of my cowkers!"
good,"Pros:"
good,"progressive, inclusive and growth opportunities are available at Starbucks. They put the employee first and it shows. You make life long friends at Starbucks. Great place to work and I would go back to work there again."
good,"The role of a barista is overwhelming at first because there's so many new things to learn, but it definitely gets easier over time. Cafe stores are much more relaxed than drive-thru stores, but drive-thru stores are much more fun to work at. The customers and your co-workers vary upon location. There's always at least one bad apple wherever you go. Depending on the store, management is usually good. The mornings are the busiest time, mid-day is slow (that's when most cleaning gets done), and evening to closing time can have random spikes of being busy depending on the day."
good,"•	Built instant rapport and provided enthusiastic service to each customer"
good,"always had fun working at starbucks! with the team amd also with the customers! such a great place to work! benefits are great as well! 401k, medical, dental, vision, vacation, leaves & bean stocks!"
good,"It has really been a good experience, good first job to have. I became part of the Starbucks family about 2 years ago, I had just moved to town from Puerto Rico and it was definitely a great way to start my life here. I get to talk to customers, make their day better with a smile and good service."
good,I enjoyed working with people my age. Have made good friends that I still talk to 'till this day. I recommend this job to anybody looking for a decent job that's flexible with your schedule
good,"Working with Starbucks prepared me for a fast paced environment, where customer service skills were key essential. This company also expanded my skills working with others and communication."

good,"Working at Starbucks is not extremely difficult, but there is definitely a learning curve in the beginning. If you pay attention and work hard, it is most definitely to your benefit. It becomes easier to do the job when you understand why you're doing the things you do. The management can vary depending on the store and the workplace culture is heavily dictated by the crew members as well as shifts. The hardest portion of the job is knowing that this is a job and to not let some of the awful customers ruin your day. It is extremely important that you keep your cool and keep smiling because those rude customers are only a small percentage of the people that actually come through those doors. The most enjoyable and rewarding part of the job was watching customers walk away with a smile on their face and knowing that you contributed to their day in a positive way even if the impact is small, it can go a long way."
good,"Worked at a very busy, fast paced store. I learned more than just how to make an Espresso beverage. There is so much more to it. I loved my co-workers and interacting with the customers."
good,"Fun, organized and sometimes fast paced environment. Many regulars stop by and you get to know the community well by working as a barista. You learn many organizational and multitasking skills here."
good,The hardest part of this job is how busy it can get. It's a great place to work but it's not enough pay. Starbucks motto is great and work ethic is great.
good,"Expect to be stressed out if you work in the morning. It's fast paced and customers WILL be rude if you are slow. A good management team makes the difference between a miserable day and a fun day. Every store has a different feel to it, friendly coworkers makes for a friendly store. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a fast paced environment. The best part of the job is your coworkers."
good,"A typical day at a Starbucks retail establishment: Fast-paced, team oriented, clear structure, amazing customer service culture. Working for Starbucks Inc. as a part-time Partner: awesome universal benefits partners, great opportunities for self-development, very positive and reaffirming work culture."
good,"Working at Starbucks is fine on a day to day basis. The job itself is fine, it pays the bills, it is not a difficult job at all if you are good with customers."
good,"It was a good job however If I were to work again I would pick a cafe location only. With the drive through things get too busy and rushed. A typical day included going to work, signing in, putting on my apron and checking in with the shift managers to see where they needed me. This could be at the cashier, drive through, or making coffee. The workplace culture was great and I enjoyed making coffee with my co workers. The hardest part of the job was making drinks as a new employee during rush hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was during the slower hours of the day when you knew the orders of the customers and could brighten up their day with their favorite drink."
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for 10 years and have nothing but good things to say about them. "
good,"Fast pace good people free coffee three weeks vacation to walk in the door good pay nice people to work for, safety awareness people friendly nice benefit"
good,"The shipments need to bring us everything we order and ON TIME. We are always short on something. Ideas that could benefit the company need to be taken more seriously. Give partners a voice. Could implement better training tactics. If more than a brand and rather a group of people who have a purpose to their work, hire accordingly and work accordingly. Half the people are just there to make ends meet."
good,"The people are what makes working at Starbucks so fantastic! Like many big companies, prioritization & decision making were issues with management. Lots of rework and frustration, but at least the teams had fun working together."
good,good company but has changed quite a bit in recent years. Job flexibility was a large perk and health benefits are also good.  Management was very good
good,"Job served me well while there. It was a part time, temporary job until I moved onto something more centered on my career choice. Was a decent work environment. Fast paced."
good,"Perfect job for students. It's nearly impossible to have your own store as a manager - it will take close to 5 years if you don't hire for that position from the outside of the company. Work here if you need something flexible, work here if you want free coffee and a good culture."
good,"it was a good place to work at that I enjoyed doing "
good,I found that Starbucks was not the right place for me. Everyone was kind and very helpful yet the demands were very high. I felt overwelmed and unable to perform the tasks at hand.
good,"Starbucks really does take care of their employees: Free meal and beverages on the clock, one mark out of coffee per week, great health insurance plans, flexible scheduling (which is great for students), and many other discounts. I have been with the company for a little under seven years, and it has been my only job since high school. I started college immediately after high school, and Starbucks treated me so well I stayed until I finished up my schooling. The hardest part of the job is trying to make every moment right for customers, but those experiences really taught me important lessons about customer service."
good,Enjoyed my time while with the company. Take advantage of the benefits they offer. The hours with Starbucks allow flexibility to go to school or have another job.
good,"The worst part of working at Starbucks is having to deal with rude people, but at the end of the day, making great connections with customers and coworkers alike is what makes each day great. It's a good job for those looking for a part-time job with flexible hours."
good,"I loved all the connections I made while working at Starbucks, it was definitely a learning experience and I wouldn't trade it for any other. I had to learn quick & fast with little to no errors. There was always a line, so I learned how to manage what should be done first."
good,"Working at Starbucks was pretty fun. I learned a lot about the company, coffee, and myself. Customer service taught me patience, and the management was very caring."
good,"Cash handling, customer service, ordering, inventory, display setup, training, safety checks.  A small list of the tasks that I preformed on a daily basis.  Learned how to multi task and deal with extreme situations while working the busiest stores in the district.  As a supervisor that worked at the high volume stores, my expertise was required to help in other locations in and out of my district.  Customer often felt comfortable with me dealing with any problems they had cause of you honesty and willingness to do what ever I could to make them happy.  I do miss my partners that I worked with as well, it was a great team and family."
good,"I often worked alone which kept me very busy, always something to do, good customers and crew. have to promote sales, 2 weeks of training tops, must learn every drink and remake them anytime your asked"
good,"My typical day at work is busy, productive, and fun. I've learned how to handcraft a variety of drinks as well as train and work with a big team. The workplace culture is relationship driven between co-workers and customers. It can be difficult during rush hour. The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationships I build with my customers and fellow co-workers."
good,"trabajo en equipo"
good,Starbucks really helped me hone my customer service skills. I learned so much about coffee and how different growing regions deliver unique flavor profiles. I loved going into work on most days because of the connections I made with my colleagues and customers.
good,"The Job is a great job to have. You meet a lot of people, it’s great for networking and it’s just a stable job. Flexible hours and pleasant experience. Besides some other stores, my managent wasn’t the greatest but we stuck it."
good,"We serve mostly students and university staff at my location. My coworkers are what makes my shift enjoyable. Hardest part of the job is to learn how to get things done efficiently. I've learned so much about Starbucks and coffee in general and what it's like to work in the food industry. Mostly importantly, the skills such as problem solving and team work."
good,"Located in the college campus there are lots of various people we see. Management is very fair in expectations, however hiring manger does not do a great job with judgment of  people's abilities to work in the fast paced environment."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is busy"
good,"Holiday season is a great opportunity to make some cash through tips, wage naturally sucks though. The culture and Starbucks is very professional yet familial. Crafting beverages and building relationships with customers is centric to being successful with the company, but training is thorough so it is not hard."
good,everyone is a family who helps each other out and strives to healp each other improve. I learners management skills and patience. I also learned that i am really good at teaching others.
good,"Because the location I worked at was in the downtown area, it was often very chaotic and there were an equal number of locals and visitors from out of town. Non-regulars were often tough to deal with, but manageable. Opening was rather ridiculous, often beginning work at 4:30am, with people outside at 4:35 demanding when we would open, which is at 5. Coworkers were great, management was pretty understanding, and benefits are really good if you make it past the 90 or so day requirement."
good,"After clocking in you find the position you are going to work that day (cash register, Espresso machine 1 or 2, etc). Once you find out, you go to that position and start doing the tasks that are assigned to that specific area. I learned how to make drinks to order using the espresso machines, how to operate the cash register and abbreviations for each drink that we had listed on our menu, how to make all other drinks according to each recipe. We worked extremely well as a team and always looked for solutions for any and every conflict confronted. The most difficult part of the job was the crash course training. You had to learn as much as possible in a very very short amount of time which was somewhat overwhelming. The most enjoyable part was everything. Working at a coffee shop was one of the best experiences that i have ever had."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks and the values they have regarding customer service. I loved making customers happy and the fast-paced environment that I experienced frequently. The only problem I had was with my manager who lied about positions and was very unfair in the promotion process. Other than the issues with the one person, Starbucks was the best company I've worked for."
good,Starbucks takes really great care of its employees and holds very high standards. I learned a lot and grew as a leader at this job. I also earned a passion for coffee.
good,"It's a nice place to work and the best part is that you usually don't take your work home with you (unless you're a store manager, I guess). Usually, the other partners and shift supervisors are great to work with, and everyone works as a team."
good,Overall a good company but not somewhere to settle down. Hours are very flexible. Really good first job especially if trying to balance with school. Room to move up if Starbucks is what you want for a future
good,"A typical day is very busy during peak hours.  Learned all about coffee, differences in taste and why. the management varies. Culture is supposed to be layed back and fun, all determine who your manager is.  The hardest part of the job is unsatisfied and rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the day was seeing customers that are regulars and catching up with them. I enjoyed selling new products and was very good at it."
good,"It was okay, there wasn't much to do while working there. Didn't have that many customers come through. "
good,Even though I am a mom of two toddlers and no longer a college student. I feel that Starbucks is a great job for college students looking to earn income.
good,Starbucks is a fast-paced working environment where you have to be quick on your feet. Teamwork is the most important thing when it comes to working at Starbucks because the way that things are prepared is in assembly line style. I liked the overall culture of the store and all the employees and regulars were welcoming to me.
good,Had a bad experience trying to transfer to a different store after I moved.  Most stores are pretty quiet during the evenings and nights unless there is a drive-through .
good,"The best thing about my job was working in a team to fulfill the same goal of providing an inviting experience to our customers. The hardest part is seeing that more can be done in creating less of an impact on the environment. This would have to come as a perk for the consumer to change their minds. However more could be done in the mean time by the company to curb the kinds of waste that it does produce. "
good,"Starbucks Culture is a very good work environment."
good,"I enjoyed working here, it was great, I just wish they would pay more. The staff was great, the customers were great, I enjoyed training the new staff as well."
good,"Complied with standards for merchandising, stocking and storing product. Served individually made coffee drinks to over 300 customers daily. Maintained regular and consistent attendance and punctuality. Prioritized drink requests while managing interruptions. Maintained and operated espresso machines, blenders, commercial coffee brewers, coffee pots and other equipment. Educated coworkers and customers about new products. Cleaned counters, machines, utensils and seating areas daily. Constantly expanded personal knowledge of coffee styles and varieties. Controlled line and crowd with quick, efficient service. Checking timers and expiration dates."
good,"Excellent place to work for anyone. Good co-workers, IT team, Management and Business team. Amazing opportunity to help one grow in their career. Every day is different but very busy"
good,Working at starbucks you get to meet alot of new faces and some familiar faces.  I enjoyed it when we all worked in sync to get the customer their order.  It was  a great place to work at.
good,"Starbucks Canada is a good a place to work. Whether you are a student looking for a part time job, a newly graduate searching for a position in your field, or someone who is looking for a full time permanent job with benefits Starbucks is a good choice for you. I learned so many professional and personal skills which I was able to carry them with me to my next position. I learned to effectively manage my time, and improved my multitasking abilities and my patience dealing with crucial situations. The hardest part of working was Starbucks was standing for very long hours. The most enjoyable part was making wonderful drinks and made people smile."
good,"I was a temp worker, so I did not get any benefits.  I do not know what was behind their decision to let me go.  I there one day and then they wanted to talk about something, then they said don't come back without even talking to me."
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabajo. "
good,"Starbucks is a place that I've learned only some are cut out for. It is a lot of hard work and there's definitely a learning curve! The environment is fast paced, but can fun depending on your team. I was lucky enough to have a team that really fit my personality and worked well with each other. Teamwork is SUCH a hefty part of the Starbucks workday, and nothing would get done without everyone doing their exact part. The toughest part of the job is dealing with customers who can be less than friendly before their coffee, especially during rushes."
good,Học được nhiều thứ về văn hóa coffee. Làm việc trong môi trường chuyên nghiệp
good,"Great culture, always pushed you to be your best and put the Customer first. Lovely people. Consistent training always given and the opportunity for development for those that want it always available."
good,"people there are great, you meet so many interesting people. Food and drinks are always good. It's a fun place to work. I enjoy my time there but it's time to move on to other things."
good,"Working at Starbucks has definitely changed me as both an employee and a person. Before becoming a Barista, i was extremely introverted. Now i am completely opposite, i have no problem with openly going up and meeting new people. Along with this the management has been wonderful to me, i went from a Barista, to a Barista trainer, to a shift Supervisor. With all of my hard work, that i do not just because I’m being paid, but because i genuinely care about my coworkers and their experience at work, as well as mine and the actual company all together."
good,A great job for a young person going through college. They give good benefits and discounts. The only downside is that they start you at minimum wage.
good,"Enjoy working at Starbucks, would like a more consistent schedule. A very stimulating job but perhaps not ideal in the long term. Difficult for a single person to live on barista salary."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks and creating/preparing new recipes and flavors. I welcomed meeting new customers and felt it was a rewarding part of the job.
good,"Durante mis casi dos años como Barista en Starbucks conocí a gente muy interesante, desde el principio me enseñaron y me trataron muy bien hasta que pude coger la experiencia necesaria e incluso echar una mano a las personas que entraron después de mi. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks I just had abetter offer at the time, something I was more interested in and pertained to my major.  I learned a lot about customer service as well as learning how to work by myself and manage multiple customers at once."
good,"Delivered a extroverted and vivacious personality. "
good,Working at starbucks was full of great suprises every shift. i learned how to manage my timebetter i learned how to work in a fast paced envoronment and i practiced alot of customer service.
good,pretty easy job but fast paced and sometimes have to deal with demanding managers and disgruntled customers. Good money for a first job experience. Demanding during the holidays. But great benefits if you need them. Room to move up if willing to learn and compete for management positions.
good,"The company of Starbucks itself is a great company to work for. They provide you with health care, stock options, you're protected and you normally get consistent hours. It is very fast paced and people normally quit after a few months, which makes the turnover rate very high. Overall a good first job, challenging to say the least."
good,"	Managing a team of 6 baristas/supervisors per shift; "
good,great job good organization not to mention culture .wonderful benefits   and diversity in Starbucks as well  those benefits include 401k stock investment
good,I did genuinely enjoy this job I just felt that the pay wasn't sufficient enough for the number of tasks I had to take on. It was still a fun job and it definitely kept me on my toes at all times.
good,I learned and grew with the company as much as possible. It taught me to be nicer customer and taught me several time management skills. My time there was not ill spent and I appreciate the management team as much as I could.
good,"I enjoyed working as a barista and shift supervisor at Starbucks. I enjoyed the fast paced environment and the friends I made along the way. Although there are some difficult customers to deal with from time to time, overall, I loved working for this company."
good,"Very fast paced and stressful sometimes , most of the employees are kind and genuine, and always have you’re back. The customers can be quite grouchy because they haven’t had their coffee yet."
good,Starbucks is a really good company to work for. The people there work in a team and they are friendly. I love interaction with different guest and sharing our coffee story together.
good,"I worked for Starbucks for six years. I would recommend it for the community, the fast paced environment, the ability to be connect with customers, the benefits they offer to all of their employees. There is a certain learning curve that can be difficult in the beginning. I've trained new baristas that are overwhelmed with the amount of drink recipes to remember. It gets easier and is a very fun work environment."
good,"I worked for this company for 8 years. Throughout these years, and many experiences, Starbucks taught me to structure my work ethic, plan, grow and have fun all at the same time. It is an environment where I can express myself while being professional. I am grateful to have worked for this company."
good,"Not a bad job.  Good breaks, good benefits.  Paid vacation after a year.  Free Spotify.  I promoted within 5 months.  I enjoyed the work environment.."
good,"If I was paid enough to actually live then I would work here without a doubt.  It can be stressful and there are customers that can be rude for no reason, but it's fast paced and you were able to be creative.  I absolutely loved making suggestions to customers and seeing their reaction when they loved it.  It has inspired me to hopefully one day open up my own coffee shop."
good,This job gave me experience in customer service and how to work in a group setting. The most enjoyable part of the job was having regulars come in to the store and you get to interact with them.
good,"After a while of working you get used to the fast pace, customers can be very picky but it also makes your job interesting. Great environment if you like to be apart of a team and like to create great customer relationships."
good,"very busy days with typical understaffed stores, which in turn creates angry customers that believe we are underperforming. management is never hired from inside the company, but rather outside of the company with no coffee shop experience."
good,"The coworkers are the best part of the job. You are on your feet all day, and the salary isn't as much as it should be, but it is a fun part-time job."
good,Fast-Paced  and fun work environment. This is definitely a job for the young and young at heart. Great work culture. The only bad side is that there are so many employees that hours can be scarce.
good,"Working with Starbucks has given me a step into meeting great team members and family members. We build together, laugh together and learn about one another. It may sound like a unprofessional bond; however, that is not the case. This company has taught me to look at coworkers as a person and not a resource. They have given me the skills to treat everyone fairly and vice-versa. With the given respect my idea of work environments has become an awesome place to grow and move up."
good,"Working at Starbucks can be overwhelming when it comes to its high volume of customers and constant required tasks that keep everyone busy. The key to success in this company is trying to build relationships with your fellow partners and customers. I've worked in several locations and if your team isn't focused on working together it can become a very stressful environment. "
good,Worked here while I was finishing out High School. My manager was very flexible with me and would love to go back to Starbucks. But the food is very unhealthy and the pay is very low. In the end its up to you in what you are looking for in a job.
good,"I learned how to manage a group of people to get the highest output possible. There were always 2 people who opened the store in the mornings.but during a morning rush there would be 4 people.We have An expediter who is  a person who rotates between bar,register and prepping food. You get to interact with so many different kinds of people and handle what sometimes can be really stressful situations.  You learn basic skills like interacting and having small talk."
good,"Το περιβάλλον εργασίας ήταν πολύ καλό, υπήρχε οργάνωση κάτι που είναι πολύ σημαντικό"
good,"i havent worked at starbucks for over 5 years. it was a great first job. i loved my coworkers. and my store was very fair with hours and alternating shifts. i only ever worked at 1 store for 3 years so i cant say if its like that across all stores. it was relaxed at times, but they do mean business there. constant cleaning and getting the store ready for the next day was necessary... i would recommend starbucks to anyone looking for a part-time or first job."
good,"The experience you have at Starbucks depends on your management. Bad management will result in a bad experience, that also includes the shift supervisors."
good,"The company is great to work for although they do not pay enough to be able to live comfortable. The management is great, and they offer great benefits."
good,"You will do well if you are a quick learner, can handle high stress, and are someone who likes to always keep busy. In a drive thru, at least, there will be times you need to go very fast and have a lot of pressure on you. Hopefully, you will have partners who support you though!"
good,"Depending on what day and time you worked, your responsibilities would vary albeit slightly. During training, you will learn all the positions that you will be working and see a professional work at it. As well, the Starbucks terminology will become a second language to you as you work."
good,I was able to learn to remain composed in a very fast-paced chaotic environment. Relying on team members was crucial in this position and management worked to facilitate that efficiently.
good,"The customer gets the upper hand here a lot so expect to be called some evil names/treated like garbage & still keep a smile on your face. Baristas are often given short end of the stick when it comes to the specialty drink craze but other than that, it’s fun!!"
good,"Typical day at work involved opening the store from 6.30am, setting up all machines and products available for the running of the day. Motivating and coaching a team of up to 16 members of staff. I learned a lot whilst working here such as cash management, stock takes, back office procedures such as orders, sending off weekly trade reports to the district manager, updating daily trackers of previous days figures and updating health and safety files and dealing with EHO and environmental health.  Management were fantastic, lots of support when needed and always given additional training when needed. The work culture was positive, professional and friendly. Hardest part of the job was the stock takes which we had to do a full count every Sunday which took a big part of the day which was difficult as we could often be short on staff. The best part of the job was interacting and serving customers whilst striving to achieve sales targets."
good,A great place to work. Helping customers and creating wonderful experiences for those who visit. You meet a lot of different people and work together with your partners on a daily basis
good,Working for Starbucks Corporation as a Senior Business Analyst in a contract position. Work in budget management automating the monthly accrual process. I have also built a budget management AOP plan through Smartsheet which connects to Excel and automates the GL ledger to provide budget vs actuals on a real time basis. I also took dashboards and reports from Smartsheet and built out a Sharepoint site in which budget numbers are updated and published on a daily basis.
good,I worked at a grocery store kiosk. It was a small operation but it was enjoyable. I enjoyed learning to make all the drinks and taking care of all of the different customers.
good,Allowed creativity and friendship. Semi flexible scheduling and on the job training. You had good and bad customers it was just your mindset on how to tackle the problems that made the experience good or bad.
good,Its fact place and fun. Its a great job to have if you're a college student. The managers are understanding and flexible. I enjoyed going to work every day.
good,I got hired on the spot at a job fair which is unusual for Starbucks to do but it was a great experience and very accessible from my home. The environment was very friendly especially when I worked the late night shifts and closed. I got to learn from more mature and experienced co-workers and they were all helpful. I would go back if I had the free time.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for."
good,Good benefits for part timers. Management tries their best so work as fast as possible and keep composure. If you have some patients and even if you don't enjoy coffee I'd say apply if you're looking for a job for a fresh start.
good,"I would make drinks, clean, support customers. I learned how to be a shift manager and lead a team at Starbucks. Management was great, I learned a lot from the store managers. The culture could vary during the time of day it was. The hardest part was dealing with coworkers who wanted to be lazy. The most enjoyable part of my job was working through the morning rush. I love the challenge and fast pace environment."
good,"Overall, an excellent place to work.  Corporate culture does tend to bring back dead ideas and revisit decisions and alignments that were previously made with no apparent purpose."
good,"I love my job, its always unpredictable, sure some days are better than others but you run into that with every job! I love how you can transfer stores without much hassle and you can meet many people who can change your life."
good,"Within my 10 year tenure with Starbucks, I've mastered the art of good, quality customer service. I'm sure to take this with me with whatever company I work for."
good,Every day was challenging and tested me to learn more and perfect technique as well as push me constantly to do more with increasing thoroughness. The culture was accepting and kind and allowed me to learn a lot about coffee and crating it. It was difficult to handle the amount of stress between needing to manage the cleaning of the store and everything in it as well as handle customer service and craft/memorize thousands of beverage combinations but the feeling of learning and accomplishing so much was not only the most difficult part of the job but also the most enjoyable and gratifying part of the job.
good,"Working at starbucks had a lot of benefits, unfortunately the management at my store changed three times so it was extremely difficult to move up in my store because of that.   Also because of the management change they didn't want to do anything about the man harassing me who worked there. "
good,I worked at Starbucks for two years. I had a great time  people were careing. I  ended up on disability and  Starbucks played for everything I needed.
good,"Starbucks provided me with  a great work environment and gave me excellent training to ensure I was prepared for the chaos that can come with each shift. District managers were different every month and different managers had different ideas about what was and was not allowed on the floor. Otherwise, I had a great experience with this job!"
good,"Super busy day starting from 430am until midnight. I did learn a lot about where coffee and the different drinks come from, taste texture and notes, and how to pair them with food."
good,"great experience with my starbucks career. nice working with the manager and other partners. feel comportable working with partners,respect each others, sharing knowledge and ideas."
good,I had made many friends in this environment which makes working fun. It can be stressful but it makes you able to handle anything after this job experience. I've learned how to handle upset customers and busy situations.
good,"I overall enjoy my time with Starbucks. There are a few things I would change. Majority of my issues are store/district specific. I love my coworkers! They are like a family to me. I also enjoy the health insurance very much. Also, nothing can beat the discounts we receive on our expensive food/drinks so there is also that."
good,"fast paced and positive workplace. They used to strictly follow the guiding principles and mission when I started in 1998. Over time as the company grew, those principles changed a bit, along with the mission and they lost the balance when they went a little too ""lean"" and began asking too much with too little. High volume stores were incredibly stressful to run successfully."
good,"MY store was stressful but most stores aren't. "
good,"good company"
good,"Everyone worked together, great training, consistent new employees. Fast paced during mornings. worked in a small kiosk so had some constricted pace. overall good work experience"
good,"Definitely a team work environment, very fast paced, constantly connecting with customers, building relationships for example learning names, memorizing customers every day drinks and/or pastry or food."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company.  They place an emphasis on education in all aspects. Including coffee history and origin.  Staff is always pleasant.
good,In a nutshell coffee industry is an exciting and ongoing industry . So there's always room for growth and with these companies you're able to do so. I enjoy the job security.
good,i was available to both open and close the store.  paid sure that all products were stocked and available on a daily basis. manage a team 0f 2 to 6 members. made sure all deposits were completed during work shift
good,This is a fun job to have but it is not near enough hours to pay the bills. Keep hiring new people even though the ones that we do have want more hours.
good,"A typical day at this job, is constructed from the high volume of guests while perfecting each and every handcrafted beverage, while maintaining a genuine connection with the customer."
good,"As a supervisor I was in charge of running the shifts and placing employees in positions, giving out breaks, and ensuring that tasks got done in an timely manner. I also made beverages, stocked food and retail, cleaned, and provided exceptional customer services everyday. Also as a supervisor I was tasked with deescalating situations with unhappy customers and making the moment right for them so they left more satisfied than when they came in."
good,"Starbucks being a good job (for me) comes down to the fact that I had some great coworkers who really made coming into work less stressful, & most of our customers were regulars so we knew everyone and what to expect. I even had a couple customers who would get excited if they saw me on bar, just because they wanted me to make their drinks for them."
good,"Starbucks was a really fun place to work, and the people that I used to work with were very friendly and funny. Overall, Starbucks was a great experience."
good,It was a starter job but it paid well with good training and decent management. The coworkers become friends. The guest are more polite than most other fast food restaurants.
good,Working at Starbucks is enjoyable because of the team you have.  However the training process can be tough because of all you need to remember in such a high pressure environment
good,"Such a good company to work for, however salary doesn't necessarily match level of work required. I loved working there and it was easy to advance internally. Management was great and the customer connections were next-level."
good,"clock in. get my apron on and greet the next customer in line and patiently provide them with their desired item from the menu. there really wasn't much to the job, pretty basic, know how to make and serve, be friendly (cant be hard) provide good service. a difficult thing may be just having to count the register all the time. nothing is to difficult, just keep the place organized and stocked up, prepare for the rush."
good,"Starbucks is incredibly flexible with hours. When hired, you fill manage your shift trough an app and you can let your coworkers know when you can or cannot work. "
good,Overall this is a fun job. Customer connections make it enjoyable. Management is reliable and trustworthy. Coworkers are overall positive. I recommend this job for those who are looking to move up within a company.
good,Loved everything about this job.  Due to economy my store was closed. Every process was structured and easy to follow.  Every person I worked with was accepting and willing to teach.
good,"a typical day at work is when you have an event that host over 4000 to 6000 people and the lines are out the door and you have to make sure that the store is well stocked and clean. your customer service has to go above and beyond the call of duty but your day as already been long and busy, you do it all with a smile and that's what keep your customers coming back."
good,I learned a lot from Starbucks in my years with them.There are many opportunities for advancement for the individual that is willing to put in the work.  The company lives it mission daily in the way it expects that employees and customers are treated.  But you must be a hard worker to succeed and its best if you're detail oriented and comfortable speaking to strangers.
good,"Starbucks intentionally understaffs which create stressful shifts, but its very in-the-moment stress that doesn't carry over into your personal life. It's a fun environment to work in where employees across the stores can relate to each other and have a general sense of comradery. New employees have to deal with a sharp learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's a super simple, easy job."
good,I have learnt lots of management skills and KPIs that helps to imrove the buisness with high profits. It was  great and challang some times  to meet new staff members for every term starts and train them.but i enjoyed every single minite when i was on my shift.
good,"The best part was being surrounded by, for the most part, supportive and hard-working teammates who all wanted you to succeed. It was sometimes very stressful working there, but sometimes it felt good that you and your work friends went through the fire together."
good,"Experiencia agradable de trabajo, muy buen lugar para tener tu primer empleo siendo un joven estudiante."
good,Good prospects to advance up to store manager position. Fun atmosphere sometimes stressful when busy. Pay is not that good but good benefits. Starbucks offer it's stock share to employees.
good,"The Store I worked at had waves of customers. So at some point in the day, it would be very fast paced, and some points in the day, it was very relaxed and chill. The other employees were great and super nice."
good,"Starbucks was a big part of my life and helped shape me into who I am today. However, advancing from within can be difficult under certain management teams."
good,Has customer service down to a science.   Is a fun work environment and the people a great. There is a real sense of personal investment with the company.
good,Starbucks is a fun fast paced environment that delivers great customers service experience and works well with flexible schedules and with life balances.
good,"Great if you love to be on your feet, and like being around a busy environment but overall if you're a desk job person, this may not be for you. The customers and coworkers make or break your time there!"
good,"Everything was good about working there. Good people, great service nothing really to complain. I lived working there however it was just a temporary job."
good,En starbucks hay una cultura adecuada para los trabajadores.
good,Very busy working at a welcome break Starbucks. Although at times it could be stressful. I thought that the management a district level was very welcome.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work while in school. They are very flexible with school schedules. The management teams is great and they do really take care of their employees.
good,"The working atmosphere in our store is pretty good. We all have a good relationship between partners and when new baristas come to the store the experienced ones are willing to help. Although the line in our store could be very long, I still enjoyed making drinks for customers and hear nice feedbacks from them."
good,"Working at Starbucks and being a barista requires a lot of interpersonal connection and reliance on your fellow partners. Each barista has a position, and these positions allow us to figure out what tasks we need to complete, and how to help baristas in different positions. Starbucks has allowed me to acquire a better sense of customer service and helped me gain responsibility and maturity."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for I just wished to pursue other job opportunities. Great benefits and flexible scheduling! Free coffee and tuition opportunities.
good,Love making drinks and customers and colleagues were lovely to work with. Enjoyed the interaction on a daily basis and found customer feedback very rewarding.
good,"Very productive and quick paced. "
good,"La  gente que en la empresa labora tiene un alto sentido de responsabilidad y  conocimiento de  sus actividades a realizar, de modo que un día  de trabajo  generalmente  ocurre  rutinariamente,   fluyendo en cada una de sus actividades. El pla de crecimiento asi como  sus políticas se encuentra bien establecidas,  la seguridad laboral que te brindan igualmente es buena. En general la considero una excelente empresa para crecimiento laboral y personal."
good,"Mi experencia trabajando en Starbucks a sido muy gratificante."
good,"the company takes very good care of you and offers some very enticing incentives and added bonuses. however, the work from day to day tends to get monotonous and you begin to feel like a robot."
good,"I loved working there the way you learn how to make all different kinds of drinks are interesting and fun. It made me more creative and I learned a lot about outside drinks as soy, almond milk.  A lot of people I work with was vegans."
good,I like to be busy and Startbucks does that for me. I meet new people everyday and we  get to come up with drink experiments. We have our own designated work station for the day which make is easier to know what your job is for the day. Everyone is chill but we all get our jobs done in a timely manor.
good,"L'environnement à Starbucks est assez agréable, les gens connaissent en général la marque, et viennent avec plaisir commander à boire et à manger."
good,"working there was fine, I left because I got a job in my field. i enjoyed working there, people were friendly. I recommend this company.I worked -, made coffee and drinks."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. It has a great balance between fast paced and taking time to get to know customers. For me personally, a typical day of work for me, is to prep coffee, prep tea, count safe, count tills, and making sure my baristas are on top of their tasks and making drinks to customers satisfaction. I have learned a lot working at Starbucks, I've learned better cash handling and how to multitask with talking with a customer and making their drinks. Management is so much different than just being a barista; more responsibilities; such as ordering product, deployment, opening and closing the store. The hardest part of the job is making everyone happy. Everyone wants something different and it does make it challenging trying to fulfill those needs, but I try my best. I think the best part is getting to know each and every customer on a personal level to when they come into the building I know exactly what they're going to order and I can start making it for them as they're telling me about their day or something exciting that has happened in their life."
good,The most enjoyable part is getting to connect with customers you see regularly but also those that come in occasionally. Being able to create connections made the tedious work more enjoyable.
good,"There is a bit fo a learning curve if you don't know anything about coffee and/or tea going into it, but the training programs are excellent. I still have a very broad knowledge base of coffee and what to taste for and even espresso beverages and how to make them properly. It takes time to be able to work the bar at peak hours (obviously they use their most efficient barista then) but if you really soak it in and embrace the culture and training, it is tons of fun (but also stressful depending on your the type of people you're serving)."
good,"Let me just start off by saying the benefits are fantastic! Free bag of coffee/tea/k-cups etc. every week, tuition reimbursement, health coverage, mental health coverage, 30% off discount, free drinks before and during your shift, and more. There are even more benefits for those working in the U.S. (e.g. one free food ""mark out"" each shift and free Spotify premium). Managers are very accommodating and willing to work around school your school schedule. When I was in university, I worked around 15 hours per week and it was wonderful. If you want to work more hours, you can. If you want to advance and become a shift supervisor, you can. I love the customers. Connecting with people every day is my favourite part of the job. Making drinks is a lot of fun, and getting to taste all the new drinks doesn't hurt either. My only complaint is that we are ALL underpaid for the number of things required of our job. When closing, there are so many things to do: sweep and wash cafe floors, take in patio furniture, clean washrooms, sweep and wash the backroom, clean and sanitize everything on the bar, prep things for the morning crew, etc. It's a lot for what we are paid; and it can be very exhausting, mentally and physically. Shift supervisors are usually wonderful, but some can be rude and treat you rather unfairly. I know for me, this was a point of stress when I first started. You have to learn their preferred way of doing things. It really depends on the store, and transferring is always an option. Training was good, but you still have to learn a lot of things on the job-- which can be"
good,"I didn't spend very much time, but quickly grew accustomed to the work flow.  Because of the pacing, it was very difficult to learn how to make drinks at my location, but I was able to quickly excel at every other position with no previous work experience."
good,"Great job for college students, but few opportunities for advancement unless you desire to manage a store. Easy to get along with coworkers and a very collaborative environment."
good,"A typical day at work was very different, it would be depending on who would come in to work, would determine the mood of others on the floor."
good,I feel like Starbucks is a great entry position for a high schooler or someone in college who needs to get some experience under the belt. I learned plenty in my time there.
good,The manager could listen more to her employees and not always judge them for things that go on in their lives especially when it has nothing to do with how they are doing at work.
good,If you love coffee this is the place for you. Great environment to work and simply be in. Great staff. Very good ethics. Lots of standing and customer abuse.
good,"Great place to work while going to school"
good,"Throughout my 2 years being at Starbucks i learnt a great work ethic, general everyday talking to people and maintaining standards. My personal experience at Starbucks made me ready for a bigger quicker paced life (outside and inside work). Loved it."
good,"Working at Starbucks had its perks for a college student. It was engaging and fast paced. There was never a dull moment, Starbucks allowed the employees to be creative."
good,"A typical day is preparing the cafe for start of a business day setting it up for a successful day of many many preferences of drink concoctions."
good,"This job could be a little hard on you with the amount of cleaning that goes into it. But the customers are great, the environment is really upbeat, and overall its satisfying work for the pay."
good,"Work at Starbucks is fun, but can be overwhelming during busy days if you aren't properly stationed by supervisors or management. They offer so many benefits to working for the company and if you work hard you can promote easily."
good,"It is honestly a great job. Of course, just like any other job, it has its ups and downs. With Starbucks, your coworkers are great. Your managers though, they can flip from good to bad, then from bad to good in a day's time. Its very unbalance with it comes to that, but in a way, keeps you on your toes. When you're the new person though, no one gives you a lot of help."
good,El ambiente de trabajo era bueno ademas de todos los cursos adicionales que te proporcionan es un buen sitio para aprender y mejorar en tu puesto de trabajo
good,nice place to work if you like a fast paced job flexible schedule room to grow and great benefits and they are very passionate about teaching and learning all there is to know about the product
good,"Personally believe that the company is great to be with. High stress job indeed but if one has the desire to work and be mature, not a bad job! Excellent place to be to impact the community. Descent starting pay and excellent benefits, especially for teenagers looking for a first job or job in general. Slightly older folks with more experience either should move up or leave the company because the company is ever changing where the older people seem to show trend of not taking changes very well. Plus, company cater towards its employees for higher positions than those applying from outside. So why not move up. "
good,"amazing company to work for. the typical work day included greeting your everyday customers and getting to know the new customers. the hardest part of the job was the peak, because you had to maintain a certain drive time."
good,"Starbucks management has been very flexible with my hours no matter how much of my time school took from me. It is hard work from making drinks and cleaning but employees can learn from tough experiences in the job. It also pays at a higher average than most other part time jobs that do not require a high school diploma. I myself was hired during my third year of high school. I learned to work with strangers, complete a chore list of duties, and to manage stress."
good,"Coffee served that people love, good atmosphere friendly staff, quick service....working with nice people in a fast paced environment "
good,"I started off a store manager then quickly moved into Learning and Development. I always had great leaders who were passionate about customers and employees as well as giving back to the community. Great company to grow, learn and develop."
good,Great culture and wonderful benefits. Love meeting new people. Management can be great if you have a manager who can deal with people and also get along with every one
good,"This was my first job! I learned so much as far as customer service, communicating and multi-tasking. Overall this job helped me gain experience for other jobs"
good,It is a fast paced environment with baristas that are willing to help. It is really busy in the mornings but can begin to slow down during the afternoon and evenings.
good,"It was a great job to have in college.  Willing to work with schedules, and hours make it easy to be able to work full time with school.  Fun environment, but can get hectic during the busy rushes, and with the promotions offered."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, each store is different so this review is based on the three locations I worked a in the Houston area. They have a tuition reimbursement program and pretty decent health coverage. Growth is relatively easy, depending on your store and store manager. The culture is amazing, you make lifelong friends with your fellow partners. You have job security, anywhere you move their is a Starbucks and you can transfer to that location.You gain so many skills, such as leadership, customer service, time management, multi-tasking etc. It is a very very fast paced environment. The only con to this job from my experience is terrible customers, I've seen incidents where customers have thrown coffee as baristas, cursed them out in front of their children, asked for absurd orders and are ready to call corporate if their whip cream is missing. In Starbucks culture the customer is always right, and it negatively affects partners. But ultimately i loved my experience at starbucks."
good,"Great place to work, good benefits, the partners are the best part about the job. They will work around you're schedule. its a great place to start a career."
good,Working for the company had its up and downs but nothing Id make a career out of. It was more of a highschool job if anything. The hours were very flexible and the stock that was given was very helpful.
good,Excelente para iniciar el camino laboral en una buena empresa. Benéfica para aquellos interesados en crecer en el ramo.
good,"Here was were I learned how to increase my management and supervising skills, but it does not add anything to my career goals. Other than that, working at Starbucks was merely to earn money while I attended school."
good,"- flexible with school"
good,"It's okay pay was decent it is high-end fast food, but still fast food with customers addicted to the product. Management was very inexperienced and was not addressed after multiple complaints over a period of months"
good,"Working at Starbucks has been the best working experience of my life. A typical day at work included me greeting many customers, making genuine connections with them, and making sure that I was adding a positive energy to the atmosphere. I learned a lot about taking direction and not being afraid to suggest new things to the management team! The hardest part of the job was the amount of memorizing you had to do in order to perfect every drink, however after a few months it all became second nature! I made many friends who I still keep in contact with to this day, and the work culture was very relaxed. We'd often have emplyee get-togethers and there was hardly ever negativity."
good,I liked working at starbucks it was busy and it kept me busy. I didn't like how when new people came in the old workers was like all mean and rude to them.
good,I have been a shift supervisor for Starbucks for over 10 years and this time I have seen the company change for good and bad. I have never had complaints about the work environment because this experience grows everyday and this job will always provide a secure tomorrow though at the end of the day this job is costumer service and you get to see the best ad worst of society.
good,Its fast paced but the people are nice and the benefits are good. The managers can get pushy sometimes and to me there felt like a political arena makes its way into your everyday work.
good,"Hours are good for a student or someone with another job. The stores are open early and late. "
good,Starbucks is an excellent company . It treats its partner like just that . Partners in business . Our customers may as well be guests in our home . I love it .
good,"I enjoyed the first several months of working at Starbucks; unfortunately at my location the management was very poor and many of the workers, specifically younger males, were treated poorly and in a different manner than others."
good,"Your constantly updated about world, giving back to community, and fun coworkers usually. Depending on location hours are set accordingly..meaning some places have better schedules set than others."
good,"I've learned a lot of things regarding beverage especially coffee in Starbucks. Training about coffee and everything are mandatory so that we can provide the best beverage to customer. The most enjoyable part of the job when we are able to try new things, new recipe. The management from Berjaya Starbucks Coffee Company will held a competition for barista to create and bring out the new recipe. Thats the most precious moment in Starbucks"
good,"Open up the store, display the from area, open the registers and safe. count the money in the safe and register. Barista handles pastries, baking goods and putting together the stand for customs. I would assist in setting up our wok station and wait until customers came in for the morning."
good,It was an amazing experience. You meet a lot of new people with all different backgrounds which helps you learn new things daily! Help was always given when needed and it’s a great environment.
good,"It was good until I moved locations and had a few employees who, despite my best efforts to be cordial, refused to act friendly to the point of a lack of professionalism."
good,Working at starbucks was overall a great experiance but when you start off you only get 8-12 hours every two weeks. The only time you could get more hours is by letting your coworkers know that you'll cover their shifts.
good,Working at Starbucks gives you the opportunity to connect with your customers differently than other customer service jobs. Often you have regulars that you see 5/7 days a week whom you catch up with like friends. The culture of Starbucks in contagious and it is a very high paced job especially if you are working in the morning.
good,"Work at least your 20 hours a week, get health care, go to ASU for free. BOOM. They are constantly growing, looking for ways to improve life for their customers and their partners"
good,"I loved Starbucks and I still do. However, the opportunity to move up was slim and there were considerably more people hired from outside the company for management positions. The benefits are great and they have a ton of options to suit different needs or lifestyles. They match 401k, offer discounts on stock (as well as granting stock to you each year), have a 30% discount on everything in the stores at any location, free food items and drinks when you are working, and the College Achievement program that lets people get degrees through Arizona State University online (which is amazing."
good,Bonos adicionales al sueldo si se cumple las metas
good,I loved working at Starbucks. The opening shift was  my favorite. Starbucks is always busy and keeps you on your toes. If you can handle customer service Starbucks is a great place to work with the public.
good,"The culture at Starbucks is generally very community minded and supportive of individual goals. I really appreciated the servant-leadership management style both as a barista and as part of the management team. The most satisfying part of the job was also the the hardest part - daily interactions with the public that could go any direction depending on the situation. I learned a lot about what i value in a manager, a team, and a company as well as how to adapt quickly to any given environment."
good,"A Job as a barista and working in Starbucks in general is extremely fast paced, the hardest part of my job was keeping up with this, working under pressure can become stressful however most of the team I worked with were fantastic. "
good,The hardest part is working in a busy area and having your team call out. puts more work on your plate. If everyone works together the day goes very stress-free.
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work.  I learned so much about customer service and I learned just how important it was to take care of my customers and my partners.  Starbucks had an extremely fast working environment, which wasn't for everyone.  The hardest part about the job was juggling the many tasks I had at once, but that was what made it fun.  Also I had a great team who always had my back, and I always made sure had theirs."
good,"i really enjoyed working at starbucks because I was surrounded with amazing people and my hours were fixed right away, if there was an error, and the pay is pretty decent, with tips as well :)"
good,"As employee as Starbucks it was great overall, I got a chance to meet different people from different walks of life from the customers to other fellow partners.  I was a fun place but it was all business as well."
good,"I was constantly moving to get my job done. Very quick paced (in the mornings). I did struggle to make drinks fast enough, but now they have a newer system of making drinks which makes it easier I believe. I did fill stressed trying to do a good job. They do award employees with buttons for high achievers."
good,"It's a great place to work. Highly recommend for an entry level employee. Very friendly environment, and it's easy to connect to your coworkers with such a small staff."
good,Great company. Great training and support. Love the mission and values. Love the the team i created. Love the culture Starbucks created. love the customers
good,"I recommend not working in a drive through store because it makes everything a million times harder. The company wants the team to get cars out in about 40 seconds while giving them a good customer experience, oh yeah, and while your understaffed. The benefits here are great but recently they've cut hours in every store, so don't expect to have a full time job here."
good,working at Starbucks was a fast paced job and it was fun The place were I was A Barista was a small community were everyone knew each other I loved working at this one because of the family environment it had we all took great care of the customers and we all had fun doing our jobs to the very best of our abilities.
good,I've worked for Starbucks for a year and they are a great company to work for especially if you are looking for opportunities for advancement within the company.
good,"It depends on the type of business your store does. I worked at a store that was swamped every single day and even with decent job culture and a good manager work/life balance was impossible because you were so exhausted and underpaid. I now work at a store that does lighter business and everything except the pay is much better. Overall I would say management and work environment is pretty good, and the benefits are great for what you would normally see in food service/retail, but wages need to be higher."
good,"Working for Starbucks is like climbing a mountain. It takes a lot of work, practice and the ability to keep a smile on your face even in the worst of moments, but when you are finally at the top you realize that it's so easy to walk down. It can become boring and Unfulfilling and the only way to take that boredom away is by climbing the management ladder. This is just my personal experience I've been a partner for 5 years and became a supervisor during that time."
good,"Starbucks is generally a great place to work. There are opportunities for advancement, good benefits and a flexible work schedule. As a barista, the starting pay is low, but employees get raises every 6 months as long as they are performing to company standards. I had wonderful management which contributed to my positive experience. "
good,"Great place to meet new people and you get to know a lot of the regulars well as well as advancing your personal skills such as communication, team work, making drinks and working under pressure"
good,"I love working there, they have a wonderful staff. The environment of working are fun and happy go lucky. I have a great time working there. There are also a lot of benefits working there."
good,"I'm currently enjoying my time at Starbucks, the partners are very nice and the work is fun. The days might feel long sometimes but the partners make it worth the time. This place has greatly improved my social abilities and customer service skills."
good,"Uma empresa incrível, uma cultura extraordinária e salário muito bom!"
good,I loved working at starbucks until we got a new manger who would talk to you crazy and she would treat you like you was a little kid the manger that was there before her was great the new to make sure we hire someone that they know how to treat people I was there for 4 years and just couldn't take it anymore.
good,"Starbucks is an awesome company to work for if you are great with customers. The customers are like family and it feels like a place to call home. Also, the atmosphere is exciting!"
good,Mostly fast-paced work serving customers or supporting store operations. Great co-workers with a good working culture. Management has changed several times based on performance and lack of ethics.
good,"Fast-paced job, but able to work around school schedule. Good environment. Management is great.  Helps those who work there if ever in need of anything."
good,"productive "
good,"Starbucks value mission promotes customer experience. If you are enthusiastic about learning excellent service skills and interacting closely with your customer base, this is the job for you.  you are given opportunities to engage with the products so you will actually gain knowledge about coffee making, preparation, etc. "
good,"Very fast paced high energy place to work.  Well paying , great benefits and lots of opportunity to advance but very competitive environment.  I had an excellent supervisor and good training. It was very stressful because I worked in a very busy location that had a drive-thru that was almost never empty. So many great things to say about this company.  I left to continue my education and further my career"
good,"As an entry level job, and Starbucks being my first job, the experience was impeccable. It has become a point of comparison for other jobs, and job duties when it comes to customer service, standards of cleanliness, and overall professionalism."
good,"Great place to work, job advancement is possible for everyone, starbucks is a company that truly cares about their employees, great benefits, great hours."
good,"Fast paced team environment with good long-term employment options."
good,Working at Starbucks was a perfect first job. It made me come out of my shell and introduced me on how to handle money and gain customer service experience!
good,"I  am working as a cashier and barista at Starbucks. As my manager stated, I managed to learn barista's techniques 2 times faster than it takes usually. I contributed to working environment of Starbucks, being friendly to coworkers."
good,"I love starbucks because it has very good caffee,And the people there are very nice to work with.And I also love starbucks because its is a very clean place to be at and to work with.I recomend starbucks to anybody that I know in my life.But if you higher me i'll be the best employed  that's you ever had."
good,I loved my time at Starbucks. It was my first job when I moved to Toronto and I remember it fondly. My only issue was with the slow pace of career advancement.
good,a day at starbucks can either be a day filled with fun an learning how to make new drinks and get better at your job or it can be filled with stress but manageable
good,"Muy grato ambiente laboral,y continua formacion en atencion al cliente"
good,"Overall Starbucks was exciting but alot to learn, I did enjoy working there, however I left to go to another job for more money. I would work there again."
good,"Making important customer connections throughout the day is crucial. I have learned the importance of working with others because in order to work effectively, we must have a reliable and dependable team. The workplace culture has been very positive, open, and accepting. The hardest part of the job is probably having to be on your toes throughout your shift, because you never really know when it will get really busy! You learn to be ready for the worst! The most enjoyable part however has been all the amazing life long connections I have made over the last few years. These connections are not only with my fellow coworkers but also with customers who I have gotten to know very well. I started working at Starbucks when I was just beginning my undergraduate degree at UofT, and I can say that this company has helped me grow as a person in so many positive ways."
good,It was good experience meeting people the early mornings the late nights trying new things building speed on my level of working for anywhere I would ever work
good,Job hours are very flexible if you are a student or need a second job Starbucks is great . You will learn to have great customer service and time will go by really fast since everything has to be done so quickly.
good,"The company compensates you pretty proportionally to how hard the job is. You go in expecting a lot and then they throw you into everything and it's 20x harder than you expected. Once you get past the first couple weeks which is a lot of memorization, it is pretty smooth sailing. Very fast work environment, high expectations from coworkers and managers."
good,"A typical day at starbucks is very busy morning, making a lot of coffee and drinks, serving the customer is always a pleasure, having good customer service experience help a lot, having co worker who understand about team work."
good,tremenda experiencia de emplo. se la recomiendo a todos
good,"I like my co-workers at Starbucks, however many customers are rude or unfriendly. It's my job to provide them with a welcoming experience, yet many are ungrateful and it's hard to stay positive in the environment. I never have the same hours every week which makes it hard to budget anything which is extremely frustrating as I am a single parent. The benefits are nice, but I make barely above minimum wage which doesn't really work out for what I need. It is great for a part time position, but unless you are a shift supervisor or a manager, you won't get the hours you need if you need to be full time."
good,"It was a nice experience, I looked at my favorite brand from a new side. However, during the busiest time we didn't have enough team members sometimes and it was very painful."
good,"Great place to work, only downfall is the pay is low. You do get tips and other great benefits, such as college reimbursement. There is room for growth."
good,"Starbucks has been amazing. Not only do you work with a great team, but work is fun, although fast, and we get great benefits only working part time. Hours are flexible as long as you communicate them to your manager. Great for college students, or anyone looking for a fun part-time job."
good,"Starbucks was an wonderful place to work with an very proficient work environment. It was nice to interact with some of the customers who came to the store daily, It made Starbucks feel more of a home too me."
good,"Working at Starbucks has given me the opportunity to learn about the food industry as well as the importance of communication. Over the past year, I have gained many skills and have become a well rounded person in customer service."
good,"Starbucks defines a workplace driven by its culture. If you enjoy the collaborative, team-focused culture, it's a great place to work. If you want to simply come in, take direction and get your job done, it can be frustrating."
good,"I have always enjoyed Starbucks. As a company, they have many great benefits to offer their employees. Now all of this also depends on your store location and it will always be a hit or miss concerning how management is as well as the team that you will be working with. But overall, I enjoy Starbucks, and enjoy serving customers with their special taste in beverages."
good,"It’s a fun, fast paced environment. It gets hectic at times, but I thrived on that. There’s always something to do so you’re never bored. Between customers and fellow employees you meet so many different kinds of people."
good,I enjoy my time at Starbucks. Very busy but I like it that way. It makes my day when I make customers happy. To me customers always comes first! The experience here is amazing. Especially the free lunch!
good,"Starbucks is an awesome place to work if you are in school or have 2 jobs. they have flexible hours, relatively good pay, and a fun atmosphere. definitely recommend this job for students or people that need some extra income in addition to their regular job."
good,"I enjoyed working in the fast past environment. It's a good environment with interesting people. It is incredibly fast paced, but actually rather enjoyable once you get the hang of it. Your coworkers end up becoming your friends after just a short period of time. The training is excellent. I would recommend it."
good,It taught me to work at a fast pace. People I worked with were really respectful. the reason I quit was that I got pregnant and it was a hardcore job.
good,I loved Starbucks the only reason for leaving was just for a better job opportunity. I attempted to stay and work for both companies but unfortunately schedules collided and I was unable to stay at Starbucks.
good,Working at Starbucks was a little hard at first because so much information is thrown at you. If you cant handle pressure this is not the job for you. Once the routine kicks in everything becomes a breeze. My favorite part from working here is the friendships I made.
good,It was great working with this company the management is awesome. I learned how to make all of the top drinks. The workplace environment was fun and everyone was easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was memorizing the drinks. I enjoyed everything about this job the drinks were fun to make.
good,"There's definitely skills to be learned in a retail environment. The benefits Starbucks has isn't too bad for say, a student that needs part time work."
good,"The employees I work with have become best friends, the longtime partners are informed and energetic and happy to work there. The job is fun and the customers are always welcome."
good,"Lots of learning, lots of connecting and no matt r what race you get along with others. Fun environment to be in especially when it’s really busy during peak"
good,"If I didn't like this job I wouldn't have stayed for so long. I love the human aspect involved with this job and the personability we can give to our customers. This job has taught me a lot about how a business is run and how to understand and develop employees while still coinciding with company goals. While it can get physically demanding, Starbucks does compensate for the work you have to put in. With all the benefits Starbucks is a great starting point in life."
good,sıcak ve samimi bir ortamda çalışmak ve insanlara güler yüzlü olmak
good,"Focused on customer experience by delivering great products.  The ""partner"" (ie, baristas) are critical to delivering on this promise so the company focuses on enabling them to create a great guest experience."
good,Overall the job can be a little over whelming. It teaches you to be quick on your feet and to adapt to the constant movement. perfect for a busy body!
good,Starbucks is a very fast paced work place. This company has amazing health benefits. The company has a strong sense of community. Starbucks is strong on training to build up experience.
good,It was fun learning how to make the drinks and working with many different people. Only issue was constant manager turnaround really hurt the store and made things difficult.
good,"Some of my best experiences with this company was the amazing employees. The company also has great benefits for PT and students, especially because there are benefits available for even PT employees. The tuition reimbursement program was very beneficial for my education. Also, the performance reviews are raises are great too. The biggest challenge was dealing with very difficult and sometimes insulting customers. They build skill sets of patience and calm under pressure though."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs, I love coffee, so learning how it is made and how to make various types of tea, coffee and espresso beverages was one of my favorite things!"
good,"This was a fun energetic work environment. Always super busy, & most team members were always willing to support each other, especially during the busiest shifts."
good,"The environment at Starbucks can be impossibly stressful, but if you've got a good team, you can get through anything. The hardest part of he job was balancing tasks with customers, and making sure needs were met on both ends. The most enjoyable part was customer connection."
good,"A typical day at work may start at 5am and may never end, though most of them are set shifts morning/afternoon. I learnt excellent customer service skills, but at times did not feel respected and not even valued. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it was a part-time job for me, therefore I could only work three days per week."
good,I had a blast working at Starbucks. The managers were cool and they were never shy to train people and keeping them rotated so they wouldn't be doing the same thing all the time
good,"Starbucks is a great job, especially for students, they work with your schedule and give part-time partners full time benefits. However when management is bad it is often over looked, luckily i was pulled out of a store that had this issue, but it is sad that they allow this to happen for so long. In short Starbucks if your manager is nice and a hands-on person you will have a great experience."
good,"Its very fast paced but your learn so much. I've enhanced my people skills, organizational skills, as well as prioritization. I've been exposed to high stress situations preparing me for the future."
good,"Fast Paced, but the customers for the most part were relaxed. Co workers were very good team players and we all worked well together. The hardest part of the job was people calling out, which would put us short staffed. Management was great they communicated well. Most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers."
good,"Visits from the DM were helpful to run a license store to Starbucks standards.  Menu boards sometimes had items that were not carried by our store.  Other than that, great experience."
good,"Typical day of work at starbucks would be to go in and start your shift to help customers. make sure you are quick with service while still keeping up on your daily chores, the management was pretty good at my store, but other stores vary. I learned how to multitask very well from my job because you always had something to do, if not multiple things to do at once. the hardest part of the job was at first staying ahead of the curve but when that became easy it turned into the most enjoyable part, the busyness of the store made it all worth it."
good,"Grat place to work with amazing benefits, works well with my social life and schedule, very fast paced and easy to learn all the products and point of sale systems."
good,"overall a good company, sometimes hard to move up in the business."
good,"Starbucks can be what you make it.  You will deal with great customers and bad ones.  If you make it a fun place, it will definitely be a fun place to work, and there are possibilities for advancing."
good,"I worked at starbucks back in 2015/2016 and i never had a bad experience. i do wish i had gotten paid better but i didn't know better. the manager was very polite with me and we never had any altercations. as for the costumers, there were always good ones and bad ones, but I worked in the medical center so it was mostly nice people"
good,Great for making extra money. Flexible hours. Business numbers can vary throughout the day. Mornings are usually the busiest. Down time allows for cleaning and prep tasks to be completed.
good,"Working at Starbucks is a role of a lifetime. You'll never forget your experience because it's always about learning. My leadership, time-management, perseverance, multi-tasking, communication, and customer service abilities heightened."
good,I can ask my boss for practical advice on how to lead my baristas and how to problem solve personnel or customer concerns. It is a good place to grow in management skills and decision making and plenty of opportunities to include volunteer work into the everyday culture of the company.
good,"Very good company to work for, met a lot of great people and learn valuable social and management skills during my time here. Management can be good or bad but it all depends are which location you want to work at."
good,"Nice work as a Part-time, you can make good friendship with customers and co-workers, good benefits if you work full time and free drinks, sometimes is chill except on the pick hours"
good,"i love working here, it is probably one the of best jobs i have ever had. The management is amazing and they treat their employees like people nit just garbage. The benefits of working for this company are amazing and highly recommend working at a Starbucks"
good,"But every company has its plus and minuses. I have been working for Starbucks for 10 years and I've learned a lot. Being in 4 different districts, 4 different cities and 6 home stores, I was fortunate enough to enjoy my time with partners."
good,"I’ve learned well how to balance work life, school, and personal life. Working as a partner helped strengthen mental capabilities and opened me to weaknesses I never knew I would be able to better for myself. Although there are inevitable stressful components, great relationships and opportunities arose from working with Starbucks company for almost two years."
good,One of my favorite positions because it was very fast paced I was always on the move and meeting new people from all over the world since it was in the disney area.
good,Fun place to work especially with the workers. full of energy and enjoy meeting new people. great company to be able to grow and move up if that is what you want to do.
good,"Petty easy going, i like the fact i cant try every drink to be able to make it as well as sell it. I liked how coordinated this job is as well because everything has a step by step instructions saying how to make or do a task."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work. The hardest thing is training and getting used to the busy pace, but once you do, everything goes well. The management and benefits are excellent."
good,"Assist customers with orders. Make drinks, run register, cleaning of store and bathrooms, stocking store with needed items for employees and customers."
good,"The company cares about the farmers where the coffee is sourced, it was encouraging to see and motivating to know you are working for something other than the CEO's bank account"
good,"Great place to work and learn fundamentals for life."
good,"If you are a college student its a pretty good part-time job, just make sure that you don't give Starbucks more priority than school (tends to happen a lot with the Starbucks culture)."
good,Starbucks is not a hard job to obtain and attain. It may of been short lived but the pay was really well and the tips were just as great. The atmosphere was like a family based environment.
good,"Friendly environment, management was good and the pay and hours were good as well. Benefits package that they provide is good and it covers most of what you need."
good,"offers some great benefits, but there is no raise available unless you plan on staying at starbucks for  a while and moving from a barista position. Which, i just need a job to help live while i go to school."
good,"I have worked at many Starbucks locations over the course of 10+ years and I honestly love my job. I love the high energy from meeting new customers and preparing their customized beverages, working with partners of all ages and backgrounds, and all the conversations that go along with it. I have learned to communicate more effectively, to multitask and push myself to work harder and faster, and the importance of working as a team. Overall, this is an amazing company to work for as they try to accommodate to your schedule as much as possible. The benefits are outstanding and the Barista culture make this a fun place to work."
good,"After working here for months, I got the flow of things and my job became so easy. I could do it with my eyes closed. Loved the regular customers and coworkers"
good,"Past pase, colleborative, provide great customer service, communication skills required, must be a team player, must be willing to work hard and learn"
good,"Very fast paced, never boring, always learning something new and always meeting nice people. Would highly recommend this position for college students as they are flexible with scheduling."
good,"Busy store most of the time because of its surrondings. The management probably wasn't the best and the turnover rate was fairly high. I enjoyed the store itself and the people I worked with. I was mostly a closer, so I worked with money at the end of the night and it was my job to leave the store ready for success for the next day."
good,I love a job that is fun but also fast paced so you feel productive while enjoying it. A job that is slow can get quite boring so I always prefer it to be a little busy.
good,I was employed during a very exciting time.  They had just gone public and grew very fast. I enjoyed the ride.  I met people who are friends to this day
good,"Fast-paced environment. Strong commitment to customer service and emphasis on value of employees. Quality product, inviting atmosphere. Typical day consists of structuring employee roles and tasks within the store, based on ability and hours scheduled; inventory/product ordering, reporting of profit an other communications to superiors, handling customer inquiries and resolving concerns, maintaining clean environment whose aesthetic  adheres to company standards."
good,"Honestly a great company to work for. You don't get paid much unless you've been there a long time or make it to [Assistant] Store manager, but it can make up for it if you have a good team around you. The overall environment is very welcoming, and I feel like you can really enjoy yourself while working there. I spent a year as a barista while I was doing my last semesters in community college and it was definitely the right place for me. Super flexible scheduling is very important, and then benefits kick in which was super cool (yay free glasses). Busy and slow stores, cafe and drive thru stores... all have their ups and downs. Management can be a hit or a miss though; if you try to advance, make sure you're in good with your district manager..."
good,Only negative thing was dealing with some very rude customers. The working hours were great but be prepared for a LOT of walking. DFW airport is the best but its huge! you will defiantly lose weight
good,Starbucks is great as a side job or for someone with other obligations. Management usually works with their partners availability and gives them opportunities to advance.
good,"As a closer at Starbucks, the hardest part of my job was getting all the cleaning done on time. When things don't start from the beginning of the day, all were doing is playing catch up. My store in particular was terrible at communication and compassion, so it turned into a whole ""morning crew VS night crew"" thing which totally sucked. Begin in this situation I learned that everything always works out. The stress I add to myself on a daily basis is completely unnecessary.  I""m a strong supervisor, my partners works hard for me because I respect them and we kick butt! Being a partner is a great experience. You bond with customers and partners and develop new relationships."
good,I really enjoy working here. My store has a great team attitude which makes it a lot easier to function. It’s super fast paced but there’s a system for everything and that helps you keep up with how fast everything goes.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, but not the best to help raise a family. The type of benefits they offer for the single person is phenomenal"
good,"Good job, I loved being a barista. New manager was disorganized. Getting to know each guest and being personal with all. Knowing people drinks specifically and being able to make their drinks on time and right was satisfying."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a good experience for me, I learned how to work with other people and share knowledge, and I liked to interact with the customers"
good,it had a productive work space. the manager and other associates where respectful and conducted their job efficiently. i had a very good experience this was because it was my first time to work in USA.
good,"Barista life at Starbucks is very fast-paced, product focused, and energetic. The environment is hipster, and customer service standards are prime. Honing the skills that it takes to do the job from the very beginning will benefit highly in the end."
good,This job has been one of my favourites. I love the people I work with. We care about and support each other. I really enjoy being a shift supervisor..
good,"People Management"
good,"Starbucks is a great starting job. When you work fast food, you want the best you can get when it comes to benefits and pay. This company pays you well for the work you do, and has GREAT benefits but if your looking for more than 600 dollars a paycheck, unfortunately they are not the right job for you.  They don't allow overtime and schedule evenly for all the employees needs, which means one week you could have 40 hours and the next you could have 30. I have had a wonderful experience with them in my one year here mostly because of the people I work with. The Crew (or your barista buddies) will be your favorite part of your job."
good,I worked there part time it wasn't much more stressful than any other job but the pay was minimum and I think it was the customers who were the real problem if there was a problem at all.
good,"Starbucks was so fun to work for. I learned a great deal about customer service and the way many drinks were made. It's not for the weak though... You have to work fast, deal with demanding customers all while you communicate over a headset. When you start, you are more than likely to be placed on the drive-thru register, don't expect to be making drinks during your first month or two. Also the morning shift can be brutal, if you are not a morning person and they only have morning shifts open, think twice about applying. You might be waking up at 3:30 AM to get ready and be there to start prepping the shop by 4:00 AM. Doors to the customers open at 4:30 AM."
good,enjoy working with my partner and enjoy the customers. fast place environment but ive met a lot of cool people working there. the best part of the job is making other people smile
good,Starbucks is not like any other coffee shop that I have worked before. e.g Tim Hortons. Starbucks is a place where you can really give a chance to yourself as a person to really innovate yourself. The condition of management is excellent as they they a systematic rules that provides them with a basic knowledge how the store should be run.
good,I've worked with grest and horrible staff but got the job done. Ive been a leader most of my employment there and took pride in my work. No chore was beneath me and I trained many others.
good,"Being a barista is time consuming, and you will need to make time for the job. Even though I had a understanding and supportive manager, I still struggled a lot with times as a student. The job is exhausting, sometimes hours are extend, you can get called in unexpectedly and will find yourself stressed almost every shift. If you are a fast learner, enjoy busy and fast pace environments this will work for you, also if you do not struggle with time tables and fixed times."
good,learned how to adapt and multi task. how to work efficiently. rush hours are the hardest part of the job. connecting with people and employess are the most enjoyable
good,"If you love face paced work environment and meeting new people, this is a great place for you. I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. I was able to learn what it eccfectly looked like to be a team player and ask for help, when needed."
good,"I think Starbucks is a great corporation to work for whether your 21 and in college or whether your 30 with two kids at home. Starbucks almost always is willing to work with your schedule and non work related schedules. The only flaw or con i would say there is, is that there isn't much room to move up in the company because there simply aren't that many positions that are required to manage or run a starbucks."
good,"Busy envrionment with lots of student customers, can sometimes be difficult; however, also great staff and friendly management. Love working at this location"
good,"While Starbucks can get extremely busy sometimes, especially on a college campus, I really enjoy this job. I never feel as if my other managers aren't listening to me and my coworkers are excellent."
good,"a day at work is always fun knowing all the regulars drinks and putting smiles on there faces , i learned to be patient with others because spreading kindess might make someone who is having a bad day a lot better. The management was always great and fun to joke around with. The hardest part at first was just trying to memorize things but the most enjoyable thing was meeting new people and making life long friends."
good,This company provides a lot of opportunity to those that know they want to advance in Starbucks. There's a great attitude communicated throughout the company that encourages personal development and interpersonal relationships. I am also constantly impressed with how the company involves itself with communities and progressive efforts to build a better world.
good,"it is a nice environment if you like coffee and can handle fast pace work. you meet various people, and have to have good communications skills."
good,"Working at Starbucks has definitely helped me a lot in the year and a half that I've been working there. They have aloud me to save money on my college education and insurances, as well as, my favorite Starbucks drinks!"
good,The hardest part was probably waking up at 3am. other than that the job was pretty relaxed. even when its busy the steps of service they have created make for not much room to get backed up on guests.
good,"This was a great job to advance my organizational, transnational, customer service, and multitasking skills, Overall it was a place I would recommend to anyone interested in a easy going job."
good,my crew and first manager was amazing. we all worked well together. we had some of the best regulars as well. i'd work with my original crew again any day.
good,"Management was not responsive to needs, especially the DM. There were cockroaches in the store for months before the DM did anything about it. There was a cockroach in a milk jug and I was told to use it still."
good,"it was a really fun place to work! I worked full time and usually worked the morning shifts."
good,"For the most part Starbucks cares deeply about the employees, on a local level this varies. There are certainly places/people I wouldn't recommend working for, but overall I love this job and I happy for the time spent here."
good,I found this job to be very accommodating to a student schedule.  They encourage their employees to pursue educational goals and even provide scholarships to some.
good,"Amazing Culture."
good,Balancing the tasks at hand while maintaining the customer experience. Learnt time management skills. Most enjoyable part was connecting with the customers.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work purely for the customer interactions and relationships that are formed. I learned a lot about customer service and my hours were very flexible.
good,"Starbucks was a great first job. I learned to be patient, kind and to work quickly. I loved getting to know people and making new friends. The coffee was always great as well.."
good,"Fun place to work, free coffee, always trying to help employees improve. Regular coffee tasting. Regular charity work. Good perks. Can move to various departments"
good,"Work hours suck if You do not have open availability or are available to close or open midships basically get no hours, Which is not fair to the people who are in school or have children."
good,"A typical day would go with you running around completing order (but I appreciate the high energy environment). The breaks and pay was fair for what I did there. I learned so much about customer service, being that it's coffee I learned what to say and how to approach an unhappy customer. My manager was great, she made me feel at home. The hardest part of my job was when it felt like we were understaffed. Most Starbucks get very busy very fast and it was hard to balance so many customer tasks, it did get done in the end and was worth the struggle. Overall my favorite part of my job however was getting to meet new people and getting to hear about others lives while making new friends."
good,"Highly stressful, but highly rewarding. "
good,"It takes a while to get used to the pace and learn the menu/how to make drinks, but once you've got it down it's easy. I loved the Starbucks culture, and once you start learning your regulars' names & drinks, they become your friends as well. Peak (morning) is the most stressful time of day. But after that it's usually not too bad. Management was great. Loved working there."
good,"The job was manageable for the most part. During the rush hours expect nonstop movement and acquiring of items to keep store running. Learning the recipes for drinks is easy, each size is designated its number of pumps of syrup."
good,I love working at Starbucks especially regular customers and team members are wonderful. its fast paced but its becomes easier over time . plus free drinks while working and weekly markouts
good,"I worked here for a couple years as a student, it was fun and challenging. Lots of free coffee, and fun with coworkers. My manager wasn't the best, but every store is different."
good,"loved working here i learned a lot i do miss all my customers and coworkers made a good impression, but pay was low besides the pay i enjoyed working there."
good,"It is a very quick paced environment. You learn to deal with customers on a friendly level and to give exceptional service, making the moment right for them. It can get stressful and competitive. It teaches a lot about creativity and the importance of team work. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with rude and unreasonable customers and having to make sure you do everything to please them. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with people you see on a daily basis."
good,"Great company that cares for its partners.  Benefits for part-time employees are great.  Great part-time job to hold while going through school/college. Get to meet a wide variety of people along the way. Positive environments."
good,"Choose your own adventure, work hard, make a statement. It is a collaborative environment and you have to push people to go the extra mile. It is the typical passive/aggressive Seattle mentality but is easily navigated if you establish relationships with the right people/groups."
good,"Expect to follow a lot of rules and adhere to the philosophy of the company. It is a lot of work, but you make lots of new friends. Unlimited free drinks during your shifts!"
good,"I was able to get to know a lot of people working here. Baristas were, in the most part, all friendly and approachable. Management was always working hard to make us feel part of the store. a bit hard to adjust at first, but it is fairly easy once one gets the hang of it. Not too exposed to rude customers, and there was always the security of employment."
good,Loved it! Just wish licensed stores paid more and offered more hours. It is not as difficult as it looks and it is very easy to make each drink/pastry
good,"My manager was helpful and understanding, hardworking"
good,I loved working at Starbucks. My regular customers would make my day and my team never made a moment dull. My boss was my favorite boss that I had ever had at that point. I would go so far as to call them family.
good,"There's always something to do, the work days can be long but the partners are usually quite kind and easy to work with. Management was always professional and accommodating."
good,"My experience working at Starbucks was fun and stressful. Each day I was faced with something new that I had to figure out. I was sometimes the only Barista in the store, and I had to make it work. I enjoyed dealing face to face with customers, and challenging myself."
good,This job was great for me while my husband and I were trying to find daycare. This job is also great for a person in school. I loved my customers and my co-workers.
good,"A decent job to have if you're a full time student. Very flexible with hours and time off. Decent pay if you are living with your parents, definitely not enough to live off of."
good,"Starbucks has been announcing a move toward simplifying its menu and products in order to make more time for baristas to create a connection with customers, but the policies, procedures, products, and working hours allotted all seem to work against this. They do offer full benefits at part time, however they are EXPENSIVE (~$100 or more per month for basic healthcare)."
good,It was a great job. The benefits were the best I have ever had. The people I worked with were great and friendly. Everyone always had a good time. The company was great to work for.
good,"Starbucks has a good culture and overall a fun place to work, but the amount of pay does not give you the ability to pay bills like a serving job would."
good,"Very friendly and welcoming work environment. Co-workers and supervisors were always kind and  supportive, Great team environment for a student or someone looking to be a part of a team"
good,"At the start of my day it was about catching up on transitioning the shift, making sure breaks and tasks were completed for the next shift.  Overall, the rest of the shift was about cleaning and servicing customers.  Additionally inventory tracking was needed.  I did have a bad experience with my first manager in that she tried to throw me under the bus for something that was her fault but both of my managers after her were great.  The culture at Starbucks is very fun and uplifting, there's some great people that work there.  The hardest part of the job for me was probably the understaffing that would occur in the afternoon shifts compared to the morning shifts.  That made it difficult to ensure all tasks as well as regular coffee service would be completed on a daily basis.  What was wonderful is the relationships you create with your customers, the regulars that come in to see you or another Partner."
good,"It's on-the-fly learning. The atmosphere of Starbucks calls for people to customize their drinks, at the price you pay it better be perfect. In California, if you work more than 5 hours without a lunch, you violate policy and the company has to pay you for another hour. At my location its hard to juggle breaks, as of short staffing lately. So, in one shift that is 4.5 hours or so (which seems to be normal) you get one 10 minute break, however, you have a nearly unlimited supply of coffee to keep you going."
good,"Sometimes the working hours weren't great (my store opened very early and also closed very late) and ended up having to do a late closing shift one day then opening the next day sometimes. "
good,"Starbucks employees are drilled in the ways of Starbucks customer service from the get-go; learning how to recognize and respond to a customer’s needs and wants. It’s tough work, but well worth it. Consider the “Latte Method” that they are trained to use in unpleasant situations:"
good,fast pace work environment. the people are friendly. The hours are flexible. If you are a person who like an fast pace environment this will  be the job for you.
good,"Learned how to work in a fast-paced environment on a daily basis.  Many aspects to this job were very time sensitive, which helped me with my multitasking skills."
good,"In terms of retail / barista /cashier / customer service Starbucks is good for a temporary job, nice for students or for part-time work, if you need it."
good,"At Starbucks I learned how to be apart of a large team, how every person needed to work together in order for us to function at our highest potential."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work at if you don't mind being on your feet and a fast-paced environment. It also helps when you have fun people working with you that aren't lazy and get things done.
good,"An ordinary work day at Starbucks is empowering and enriching, with new things to learn from every shift. The workplace culture breaks free from hierarchies between employer and employee, encouraging relationships to develop out of respect and recognition rather than a fixated boss-worker relationship. Getting to know in depth about the lives and personalities of my customers gives me the greatest satisfaction out of this job. However, occasionally there will be difficult customers which we will have to appease to, disregarding our pride and sometimes logic. Despite setbacks, the management ensures that employees' are contented with their jobs and reward employees that deserves to be acknowledged."
good,Not very accommodating to students who need to take days off for school purposes - otherwise a very good learning and working environment.  A lot of double standards with between partners and management.
good,Fast paced environment. Fun place to work.  The people there were fun to work with.  The customers were nice.  The money was good.  Seattle was a nice area.
good,Exciting time to be there. Starbucks made sure culture was alaways top of mind. Enjoyed being part of the team along with many great tenured partners.
good,"The job is fast paced and you are there to help the public. Any public service job is frustrating so just know what you are getting into. I worked there for 5 years and four of those years, I was a supervisor so I had to deal with both the employees and the customers. It was frustrating often, but the coworkers can be fun."
good,"Working at Sbux is fun and it can be very rewarding, however, there are moments where the workplace and be too much. The customers can either be very nice or rude, however, that does not mean that I did not love my regulars there. Moreover, the coworkers I have met over the past 5 years there have been amazing."
good,"This is the best customer service jobs I can get as a single mother(allowing flexibility in scheduling, a friendly group of coworkers). The benefit makes Starbucks one of the best past time job."
good,"The job was fun, but it is a job for high school or college student would be satisfied with.  The shifts are about 6 hours long and people constantly order coffee. It isn't because there is plenty of staff."
good,在這份工作當中，最吸引我的是整個企業的服務品質。有很多領導者是我的榜樣，我學習到察言觀色，知道適時的說合宜的話，並觀察顧客的每個需要及想法，遇到不同需求或是情緒比較激動的客戶，應該給予適當的協助和聆聽。而在這份工作中我很享受和顧客的每個交流，更能和他們成為朋友。
good,starbucks is great and has tons of benefits. Starbucks really cares about their employees wellbeing and has lots of great perks. I would recommend this job to anyone who is just starting or to anyone who would like to pick up a second job! Starbucks has been very flexible with me working three jobs.
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks could go good or bad, depending on you.  Being with Strarbucks for over 10 years, I've learned how to really multi task in customer service, making and fixing coffee, and etc."
good,"The most  enjoyable part of the job was to talk with customers, meet new different people every day."
good,I really enjoyed having a fast-paced workplace. Plus seeing the customers happy made the hard work feel worth it. Many people come in with the idea that it is just about making coffee. It is much more than that though plus you have to make sure your customer service is on point. Working at a real Starbucks has different benefits than a licensed store too.
good,"There are regular day to day tasks that need to be completed at the start of each shift. The peak times could get a little crazy, but with coworkers helping out they run smoothly!"
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work at; however, some manangers expect too much from you. Also, it is very fast-paced. This job is not for everyone. The customers are often the main reason why I stay. It's the relationship one builds with them."
good,The company is great for college kids but not for grown adults with family's that depends on every cent to make a living .. the company will be better if it offer more family discounts
good,"Fast- paced environment, depending on location.  Great job for anyone. Easy and fun job under right management and team.  Starbuck's offers a lot of benefits, and salary is slightly above minimum wage."
good,"The best thing about working for Starbucks is the benefits package, which includes affordable insurance. The company also simplified the coffee shop making customer service more fast-paced and workers didn't feel overworked. I had one of the slower stores, but that gave me the chance to get to better know our regular customers."
good,"Working at Starbucks as a student has been wonderful, but the environment is competitive and fast-paced. The hours can be hard to incorporate into your life as well, some locations open at early as 5am and you are expected to be there at 4:30 am if you open."
good,"It was a licensed kiosk, so most of our directions came from the Safeway/Sobey's  side of things. For what it was, I loved working there and would do it again."
good,"I would recommend this place to a student in particular they have excellent benefits for part time worker. But the culture can be annoying. If you don't fit the liberal bill, some co workers tend to excluded you."
good,"It was okay to work at, I worked at a licensed store and most of the issues arose from that. You definitely need to have a good memory and be able to multitask."
good,Good Place to work. Friendly staff and always willing to give hours when available. Quick pace and constantly busy so multi-tasking is a must when working for this company
good,"I do love starbucks as a company, but it can be very stressfull at times. It has a lot of great opertunities your can take advantage of if you can handle the stress."
good,This was such a fun job but it was a lot of work. The mornings are crazy busy and you're running around a lot but after it all ended it was calm and relaxing. I loved my manger she was the best manger I ever had. Between her and my coworkers it was always great! I have very fond memorizes of working there.
good,Great coworkers and benefits. Pay is low though. This is a great employer especially for a student or a parent who wants to receive benefits for their family.
good,"I didnt work as a Barista for long, but it was rewarding having relationships with regular customers and it was an overall fun environment to work in."
good,"El día comienza, abasteciendo tu área de trabajo, y depende a donde le asignen a caja o preparación de bebidas, en las dos áreas uno disfruta mucho, se puede relacionar con muchos tipos de personas ya  la ves ayudar a tener una gran experiencia."
good,"It's a fun environment to work in. Quick paced, eccentric people, but the pay could be better. In my area what I got paid was good money if you lived with parents or had three roomates, but if you are trying to live alone or with one other person, you'll need a second job. Free drinks on every shift and a free food item per shift."
good,Starbucks is a good startup job if you don't intend to stay within the company. You can gain a lot of experience working there that can help in future jobs.
good,"Great place to work if the managing staff is good. I enjoyed the environment and my coworkers, wonderful part-time job. Advancement opportunities vary by location and manager."
good,Starbuckss is typically a fast paced work environment depending on the time of day you are working and where you are working. The people that work there are generally a wide variety of characters and some really good friends can be made. It is super easy to connect with customers and it is fantastic. It is a great place to work while trying to get through college and the pay plus tips is typically very nice.
good,"Great place to work, some people use it as a temporary job, some make a career, but both is possible at Starbucks. Im adding another sentence because it wants more words."
good,"Starbucks was a very fast pace establishment. Through each day you learn how to work as a team and build a relationship with customers. The company did have great benefits as well as rewards. "
good,"A great place to work overall, must be willing to let customers come first in every situation. Many policies are in place that may seem silly, but overall and amazing company to work for if you want to take your retail job very seriously."
good,"My first job and a very good place to start as a worker."
good,"I only worked as an intern on a specific project but I had the opportunity to talk with many employees about their experiences. There's very little direction given from senior leadership - one of their favorite things to say is that you should be comfortable in ""ambiguous environments."" That can be good or bad, your take!"
good,"Lots of great things. I had a couple bad managers and the pay is not good. "
good,"busy always running around like a chicken with there heads cut off .i learn to make lots of different types of coffees and teas ,most enjoyable part was meeting new people"
good,The position as barista is a great job while working through college and life changes offering flexible days and hours.They offer benefits when working 20 hours per week.
good,"To start, my employees weren't exactly too nice of people when I first started. The environment was very fast paced. That was not a problemm due to my job experience. My boss was kind of a pushover too."
good,"Working hard to maintain customer satisfaction and have to work as a team to succeed. Not everyone may agree, but we agree to disagree and do not let that affect us in the job. We cannot make everyone happy, and there will be that odd one out who does not enjoy our service, but other than that- most customers are happy and satisfied with the food service we provided."
good,"I very much enjoyed my time while at Starbucks. I worked at both the Target Starbucks and a traditional drive-thru. Good management is key to a good employee experience. They did have trouble working around my school schedule/personal tims. Overall I would work here again, just would need to be flexible."
good,"I love working at Starbucks so much that I've stayed on despite having a full time job elsewhere. It's fun, fast-paced and full of life. If you like people, this is a good job for you."
good,"I love how fast paced this job was. It was great, it got things moving and things going. The only thing that is wrong certain supervisors had horrible time management and I did not like how they were not team players."
good,"*busy work day, but fun and nice to interact with coworkers freely."
good,"Management at stores is lacking in organization. I enjoyed seeing my regular customers. Pretty simple job to work on a strict scheduled, with well running staff."
good,"greeting gust as they walk in, set timers for the next bach of coffee."
good,"I love working at Starbucks, it has an amazing atmosphere and is a positive work environment. I ran into difficulties when it came to a Leave of Absence, although that was my only trouble with the company."
good,I was promoted on my first year. The culture was pretty relaxed but the shifts were sometimes excruciating when corporate tried to save money and made us cut down on people per shift.
good,"Its a great company to work for, you have everything from free coffee and free benefits. The pay is some what competitive but of course stuff does happen"
good,"on a typical day i would come onto shift with the mind set of having everything done that i could do for the next shift supervisor to come on the floor with no ""hiccups"" to transfer over to them."
good,"It was great opportunity woking with starbucks team, working for more than 5 years  i have gained a lots of new skills and enhance myself to  grow further in hospitality industry. "
good,getting to work with friendly people and in positive atmosphere was a good experience. They give good on training and knowledge to help you succeed through the day to day task.
good,"Great customer service, nice products and good atmosphere. Enjoy being social and meeting customers, working with people from all over the world. Also the shift work allows for a good work to life balance"
good,"Compared to what I use to do, working part time at Starbucks is fun! I have learned so much. There is always something to do. If it's making coffee it's keeping the store clean"
good,"Starbucks has the sole purpose of providing coffee to customers, so in turn they teach you just about everything there is to know about coffee. Its a fun place to work because of the people you work with. When I was there the hourly pay left a lot to be desired however the tips helped out a lot. Management is the best and are always helpful. This is a great starting point for anyone; no matter age, gender, color,or creed. Absolutely would recommend this job to anyone who's looking to enter the service industry."
good,"I worked in a drive-thru only location that was very fast paced, but had its downtime too that involves a lot of cleaning, stocking, and making sure we are on par to meeting sales goals. I have enjoyed being a shift supervisor but being a barista is a lot easier and less stressful."
good,"Todos los días mucho trabajo, buena música buena gente."
good,mucha comunicacion y las relaciones son muy amenas entre todos
good,"I love the management, I love the work ethics, I love the family environment. I first started working at Starbucks when I was 19. The people I met had such a big impact in my life, I can barely imagine what kind of person I could have turned into without their influence. I met some of the most extraordinary people ever."
good,"A good job for students."
good,"Wonderful place to work and come in on your day off.  The job can be hectic at times, cold front, supply shortage, unruly customers etc.  getting to know the customer has to be the best, many connections can be made and lifelong friends can be made as well"
good,"Starbucks CAN be a great place to work. I was a barista in 3 different states, and one store in particular was incredible. However, food (drink) service is not for everyone, including me. Do you want customers to treat you like a human? It can really be hard sometimes. The pay isn't good at all unless you live with your parents, but the other benefits are great. If your store has a community culture, you'll love your work and have friends for life."
good,"· Supervised staff of 17; trained, evaluated and delegated responsibilities; monitored employee work and gave final approval upon completion."
good,Wonderful company and culture. Very fast paced and intense work environment. Some locations are busier than others. Team work and family sense is intergrated on a daily basis.
good,"Fun job as long as you get along with everyone. Customers can get very rude and environment can get very stressful. Sometimes expectations of duties to fulfill can get VERY unrealistic. Making 10+ drinks under 5 minutes on your own, taking orders from one customer, dealing with another customer, and working the cash register all AT ONCE and by yourself. Lately it seems as though every shift I work we are understaffed. Not sure if this is due to the company and its rules on staffing or my stores manager."
good,"Mornings are busy, lots of loyal customers, and a great environment to work in overall. Good first job, it's very important for baristas need to make sure to follow duty sheets."
good,"being a Barista is a very enjoyable work, since you deal with different customers by providing them good quality drinks. The people around the company are opened for everything and also feedback."
good,"Great place to work is you're just starting out or looking for a part time job.   Terrific atmosphere especially if you're a coffee lover, like me.  Great benefits!"
good,"I loved the job and the people, but once i got to understand how the hierarchy works and how long it took some of the people to reach the level they did i became a bit discouraged. I also wasn't really in love with what my tasks were everyday, I'd prefer an environment that was mentally stimulating something that I can develop my mental abilities and also have a comfortable work environment. I want to work towards something more than just making a cup of coffee everyday. Other than that I loved the job and the people, I just prefer to be challenged."
good,We've  all had a drink or 10 here! Great company . Worked here through college. It took care of my needs and the hours were always available . The people were nice.
good,"Great job at the time, put me through college. Had a great training manager, knew nothing of coffee before I worked here and left a coffee heavy weight."
good,I enjoy working at Starbucks. I like making drinks and developing relationships with the customers. It is a fast paced work place that develops my professional skills of multi tasking and maintaining professional composure during times of uncertainty.
good,"At Starbucks you have a great opportunity to learn the great skill and artistry of coffee. Starbucks offers you educational avenues keeping into the tasting of coffee and coffee pairing to educational support to obtain a bachelor's degree."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Starbucks. It is way more than just a job. It's a family environment. The relationships that were made with the customers were very personal. I still see a lot of them around town and we talk like old friends. The management was phenomenal.
good,"There's always something to do at Starbucks."
good,"This was my first job. It was a great job, because the hours are very flexible, and they worked with my school schedule. Great benefits that often go unused if you are in high school."
good,"Worked here for 3 years, of course it had its downfalls but it definitely helped me in my growth as an employee and a person. This job taught me many skills that i have carried along the way. They offer great benefits and job security."
good,"I love my co-workers and you get great networking experience. But it is a fully loaded job. You're expected to perfect four different positions just as a barista. As a Shift your expected that, plus more.  If you're needing a well paying job, this isn't it. But ifyou want a job with a fun atmosphere and perks, this job is perfect."
good,"I worked the opening shift Building relationships with regular customers and coworkers can be great. It's a fast paced environment with good benefits. Having worked for Starbucks for nine years I saw a significant change in the company. It went from feeling like your cozy neighborhood coffee shop to a chain. It seems over time management cared more about expanding to compete with chains like McDonalds instead of refining what they were good at. Over time they listened less to the feedback of their employees and made changes to micromanage aspects of the job that made it more difficult and less efficient. But overall, it was a good experience."
good,"This was my dream job. I loved nearly aspect, all except the pay. The benefits were wonderful but i hardly ever get sick and rarely need the degree of insurance offered. Would have loved to been compensated better"
good,I learned a lot of time management and multi-tasking skills as well as worked with a diverse group of people. Starbucks helped me to develop delegation and supervision skills.
good,It depends which one you work at if your job is awesome or poor.  Always worth trying.  Plus training is always a set up for success or failure.  Just go in with a open mind.
good,loved working here and a great team to work with. face paced and this made the day move quickly .  days started early and shifts ended early leaving lots of time during the day after leaving. learned alot while working here.

good,"Great place to work "
good,"Fun work environment, specially for young people, a lot of work, fast peace, good benefits, MSP paid, flexible schedule. If you are looking to have a good first experience, this is the place to work for."
good,"I loved my time with Starbucks, you meet amazing people both as co workers and customers. There was a very supportive atmosphere for the baristas through the partner helpline."
good,wish that there was easier room for advancement and that the manager would have a little bit more of an understanding with the scheduling of the partners but i love the environment just wish i was guaranteed more hours and better pay based on my work ethic not just time you've been there
good,"Crafting drinks makes the time fly. Picky customers can be frustrating, but for every jerk there are ten genuinely delightful people. You really do get to know your regular customers and make friends with them. It's an interesting culture - similar to a bar in some ways."
good,great place to work at. the people are fun and inspiring. I did mess up by using one free coupon. and they were upset. you get free coffee every week.
good,I have made a lot of life friends working here and made some great connections with the customers that come into the store. I have learned a lot about working with people and I know it’s going to help me a lot in the future.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you have the right management. Can be hard to get promoted beyond shift supervisor. If you are not going to take advantage of the benefits there is no point in working there.
good,"This was my very fist job when I was 15. Really great salary for beginning workers, and they have a fantastic training program. Lots of opportunity to move up and lots of education."
good,"Hard work,learned teamwork, amazing work place culture, keeping the place clean was hard, working with your co-workers was the best part of working at Starbucks."
good,"I love the culture, partners, coffee, and benefits. It was hard to have a good work/life balance as a store manager though. I plan on finding a new career soon but staying at Starbucks part-time as a barista."
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks consists of a pre shift. A line hand off with the shift that is leaving. Quality checks, changeovers, and trouble shooting. (Every day is different)."
good,"I really like the flexibility that Starbucks offers. It was a great team atmosphere, and the provides a solid training program. The ability to progress on a career path is there if a person is interested in it."
good,"At this location I learned how to work at a fast pace.  It thought me how to multitask in the work environment, how to accommodate to people's orders and request and how to stay positive when it gets busy."
good,"most days are pretty fast paced but you manage to learn alot about different people that visits the store i learned how to make a vierty of different drinks such as cappuccino's,caramel macchiato's,and latte's also i learned many different things about coffee beans and certain origins of coffee."
good,"Typical day at work would be something very engaging. I learned a lot in many ways, whether it'd be talking to our customers and showing them that we really care as well with my co-workers whom I called partners and the management. The hardest part of the job, I say, would be dealing with work under pressure especially in rush hours but there's nothing to worry about as long as you're on top of what you're doing then you're completely fine. I enjoy working especially when you get to know people from different walks of life and that's what Starbucks shared with me."
good,There was plenty of structure and questions answered about processes and systems.  A good foundation for anyone wanting to move on and know what a good training system looks like.
good,"Easy and fun environent. Workers there have unique personalities and corprate is really good to their employees. Starbucks has customer service as its prized trophies, so if youre not good at that, then dont apply"
good,"I learned a lot in this job. Patience for dealing with problematic customers, yet I had a surge of confidence at learning new things like making coffee beverages and being kind and helpful to people. Also, made a lot of great friends both as customers and coworkers. I wish I could have afforded to stay."
good,"Starbucks is a company that looks out for its partners, to an extent. If you stay in one position to long you tend to lose out on things and are typically hassled about movement. there is no room for complacency."
good,Co workers can suck but the company really makes partners feel valued. I've never worked for a place to where I didn't feel k was underpaid or being taken advantage of until I started working for Starbucks. I feel valued and appreciated as a partner and as a bottom tier employee.
good,"My manager was always understanding and organized. The atmosphere is quick paced, but also very friendly and accepting. The hires were always diverse."
good,"Nice job- no real advancements ever awarded- expensive insurance. managers don't really care about you, just want the job done. very well customer based"
good,Learning to make all the drinks can be stressful but it's fun once you get it down. Drive through can be scary but end up being really fun as well. Great job if you love multitasking and doing a lot of things at once. Work environment depends on managers and shifts leads. You win some you lose some in that department.
good,"ES buen trabajo, tiene buenas prestaciones y atención"
good,"Customers can be demanding and nuts at times, but the rapport with most customers is exceptional and you can develop great relationships with most. Flexibility at my location was very accommodating for a part timer."
good,"Starbucks was my first official paid job. I started when I was a senior in high school and resigned in September of the following year. Because I was a minor I was only allowed to work part time, however this did not change once I was of age, causing me to resign."

good,There are so many wonderful things about working for the company. My favorite is probably the flexibility I have with my hours. I also love the company culture and enjoy working with everyone. A lot of employees love their jobs because it looks great on a resume and allows them to gain a lot of knowledge.
good,"Id recommend starbucks for students. They're open a variety of hours so its easy to work around your class schedule. I had a lot of fun being an opener, which required me to wake up at 4 am three times a week."
good,"Working at Starbucks a typical day at work consist of each barista taking on various assigned  tasks, attending to customers, working at a reasonable pace & perfecting tasty espresso drinks!"
good,Fast Paced and stressful at times but a fun time. Great Benefits and Ability to move up in the company. Was able to transfer with company 3 times to 3 different states.
good,On the average work day you would have to make sure customers are pleased and making sure you get out your drinks and food out in a timely matter. most enjoyable part of working here is when you work with people you like working with because it makes the day go by faster.
good,The team and culture here is awesome. I constantly felt supported and cared about. Benefits are very decent. The only thing that sucks is the lack of hours and pay.
good,"The location and people you end up working with truly sculpt the entire experience. You can go from a completely terrible store in a bad neighborhood with nobody following the rules to a very busy city store when if you don’t know one little standard you will be chastised for it. If you want a management position be prepared to wait years for a promotion. To be a manager you’ll need to be an outside hire or a barista for 2 years,  shift for 2 years, asm for a year then maybe manager eventually. Not every manager can help you with your benefits and stocks. All of mine were not knowledgeable and I lost a lot of money.  A lot of locations have high school students or just generally dramatic people who stir up unnecessary issues."
good,"In every working day, tasting Coffee and sharing personal experiences, was really typical day as well as working culture at Starbucks. Even customers could join these sessions maintained  attachment and healthy relationship in between the customers as well as coworkers."

good,"very busy and lively place. a lot of benefits for employers. you also learn a lot and you become more time conscious, more swift , more polite and it a plus for everyone around you and especially to those coming to enjoy their coffee or have a peaceful moment."
good,"As a store manager, the typical day at Starbucks depends on many different things such as staffing levels, current company focus/initiatives. Constant coaching to develop employees and maintain a positive workplace culture. The hardest part of the job is turnover which can lead to over-working and burnout. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexible days and vacation time which help me decompress and be the best manager I can be."
good,good work environment if you like to clean and don't have a problem cleaning up after customers. pay is competitive and benefits are great! stressful at times of business but a smile goes a long way.
good,"This is a very high paced job you will find out very early on. Multi-tasking is a major part of this job, you are constantly doing many things at once. Before you know it your day is done just as soon as fast as it started."
good,"Great place to start a career, good for part time, they worked with Class Schedule. Wasn’t there long enough to say if i really loved or hated it. Tolerable."
good,"Working at Starbucks taught me a lot about team work, personal achievements and time management. i enjoyed it greatly and would refer a friend at any time."
good,"The management and DM's can care more about who works for them. As well as the higher up faculty can lead by example and care more as well. In turn it can be a great positive ripple affect, or be the opposite, and many times you can feel underappreciated."
good,"I have experienced to see Starbucks grow and was able to be a part of building a brand new Starbucks in Renton, WA. The Starbucks superintendents have been very supportive and understanding on how the job is ran from the ground up."
good,"Loved the job. The company was more than willing to work with you and the environment created by staff and customers alike was great. It was sometimes hard to keep up with the pace of things, but overall the excitement was great!"
good,"I have all the skill and experience in this management role.This companies has helped me develop great relationship with developers,vendor and senior management."
good,"Starbucks is always a nice place to work at. We do have our customers who like to be extra and ride on their stuff but we tend to manage it. After all,  I think it’s the people you’re orm with that makes it better."
good,I loved making the drinks and having regular come in and ask for me to make their drink. Loved meeting new people everyday and getting to drink coffee everyday
good,Starbucks was a fun place to work. you were busy but you also had downtime to get to know customers or fellow baristas. small place to work in so your fellow baristas became your friends. the hardest part is implanting new rules and guidelines. change is hard
good,Good company. Many perks and benefits. Good coworkers. Training are provided and trainers are awesome to work with. Very fast paced. Time flies really fast
good,"Always needs to prepare for the rush on peak time, courteous and friendly with customers , the culture is great and be ready to work as part of a Team. We go through a lot of training and review. "
good,great to work at starbucks for passionate people with drive. enjoyed the constant fast pace enviroment. training given and always a strong line of support in stores. eager and many development oppotunities.
good,"My shift normally starts at 4 pm onwards and would end around midnight or so. I learned a lot by working at Starbucks such as: how to make cold and hot beverages, how to make the perfect texture for coffees, and also how to deal with customers. The management is great, they took good care of us employees and they made sure that we are happy working for them. The workplace is so fun, everybody is always positive and fun to work with. The hardest part of working as a barista at Starbucks is to be able to keep up with the busyness of the store. The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks is the benefits you can get."
good,Starbucks was a fun place to work at.  The employees and managers were really nice and made you feel special.  They understood when there were family matter that need to be taking care of.  The hardest part of the job is deal with angry customers.  But all you can do is your best and fix the issue.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the amazing employees and the coffee tastings.  I love coffee and to be able to get free coffee and taste different types of coffee all the time was pretty cool.
good,Working in Starbuck is an excellent experience to me. I learned a lot about different types of coffee and the way to brew the different type of coffee and the way to make different kinds of drinks.

good,"Very challenging environment, great career development prospects. Multinational company with great relocation opportunities. Gives great overall managment experience challenging you every day."
good,I loved the job I learned a lot  very easy job love make the customers happy seeing them coming and going I got along with everybody wasn't nothing really hard about the job
good,Aprendi muitas coisas nessa empresa fazer cafés atender bem os clientes
good,"A typical work day was very upbeat and fast paced no matter the day.the hardest part of the job was being able to grow so attached to not only my coworkers but also my regulars, and then have to leave the company."
good,"Working for Starbucks was wonderful because I met some of my closest friends there. However, it was intense because I worked at a very busy location. It taught me a lot of great social skills that I use to this day."
good,"The customers I saw every day made my job a pleasant one. Being able to communicate and connect with them over coffee made me feel important, and I know it made them feel special when I would remember their names or their drinks."
good,"Working at starbucks I got to meet a lot of new people. You are the first person to help make their day better and that is constant throughout the dy. Coffee is very important to our customers and being a great worker with a smile on your face, working here is fun!"

good,"I worked mostly in the mornings, getting up around 4:00 AM. I mainly opened the store, and provided setup for a typical work day. Fast-paced atmosphere of making coffee and pastries for the customers that came in every day. I loved almost all of my regulars and knew about their lives and really gained personal connections with a lot of people. My manager was the best manager I have ever worked with and gave me the confidence in myself to pursue a higher position with the company and to also pursue my dreams in the world. She encouraged me to never be content and always strive for more. The hours worked is the most difficult part of the job for me. Not the number of hours, but the fact that you could work anywhere from 4:30 AM to 10:30 PM. I love making my customers happy and becoming so knowledgeable about the products that I sell."
good,"Great benefits. Flexible with hours. They give you free drinks, free coffee every week, they pay for your school at Arizona state, give you health benefits if you work at least 20hrs a week. Give you stock grants. They don't pay a lot and you are over worked since there isn't ever enough people."
good,I greet customers as I handcraft their perfect beverage. I learned to multitask and be more organized. The hardest part of my job would have to be making sure customers are not waiting to long for their orders when its really busy.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks. It was busy often and would make your shift go by quick. The management was personable and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was the stress from the crazy coffee lovers.
good,If morning shift you must prepare the bar. For example opening the product and focus on cleaning before customer come. If middle shift focus on take item for store room and put at store. And if noon shift just focus on customer service and closing
good,"A typical day at Starbucks was usually the same as always. When you arrive you are assigned to a certain position and depending on how busy the store is that day you may be asked to switch positions in the middle of your shift or possibly work two positions at once. I learned how to work better as a member of a team, and also how to make hand-crafted espresso beverages. I never personally had any problems with my shift managers, though I know that there were a few disagreements among baristas and shift managers that would occur. I thoroughly enjoyed my workplace because I worked with such amazing and pleasant people. The hardest part of this job is learning the beverages in the beginning because you feel like you're never going to learn them all as fast as everyone else but with practice eventually everyone gets it. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the amazing people that I got to work with. It's not like that at all Starbucks but I was blessed to have great coworkers."
good,I really liked meeting new and interesting people everyday. you get a lot of regular customers and when you know there drink by memory it makes them feel special which i really like.
good,"The location I worked at was a particularly busy one. Small cafe, but large and loyal customer base. Drive through consisted of around seventy percent of the business, and the health and safety standards are strictly enforced. Management throughout my ten years was consistently good to excellent. Had the pleasure of working with many terrific individuals. There are many outstanding benefits as well."
good,"Overall, I look forward to coming into work at Starbucks. It makes me happy knowing that a lot of costumers recognize me and remember my name. It’s always busy and it makes my day go faster!!"
good,Overall a good company. The store I worked at wasn't the best but all in all I loved working there. The management was terrible and there was always discrepencies between night and morning shifts and no initiation from higher up.
good,"Lo que mas destaco de mi paso por starbucks, es la calidad e importancia que tiene el trabajo en equipo para otorgar un buen servicio."
good,"This was a great job to learn about business! Hiring, training, staffing, scheduling, supply ordering, equipment maintenance, P&L analysis, developing people, everything! I started as a 17 year old barista and came back to the company twice because I loved the culture."
good,"Perfect for college students as they are super flexible with personal schedules, especially once hired and in the event that you’d need to change availability. Great benefits. Poor team and poor management can make for a more stressful day than necessary, but that’s any job. It’s important to remember that at the end of the day, it’s just coffee."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks. High paced but nothing too crazy. The people you meet and work with are great you become a family over the years. Making beverages and maintaining your store clean is a must but of course customer is the priority always.
good,"Very busy, especially during the Peak times. Regardless, got to learn a lot about customers services and how to please customers. The experience looks great on your resume and it was a great stepping stone for my developing career path."
good,I learned how to sequence and make about 18 different drinks. I learned the different types of drinks and pumps. Starbucks is a really great company and have a lot of opportunities or there employees.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks, the people were sweet and down to earth. I believe the hiring process could be a bit more structured. I found myself working with people who really didn't want to work and pull their weight. This made it hard for us to roll out a consistent product for our customers."
good,"The hardest part about the job was the location. I worked at one of the busiest Starbucks locations in Lafayette, in my opinion. I enjoyed meeting all the different customers but I felt we never had enough baristas to manage the high volume of traffic coming through the doors. Most of the the store seems chaotic up until about an hour before we closed to doors. The culture is what I loved the most about working there. I felt very comfortable expressing who I am with coworkers. On the slow days, I had a lot of fun creating fun drinks to try and for customers to sample."
good,"Starbucks is a great employer for various stages in anyone's hospitality career. Whether starting as a barista, or being hired into a leadership position, Starbucks offers extensive training, setting you up for success with plenty of resources at your disposal. All positions are well compensated too, especially when taking into account benefits."
good,Working here was fun and quick to get insurance benefits amongst others.  Decent pay but little room to move up with little advancement opportunities.
good,The best company to ever work for. The pay and benefits are above the average rate. Benefits for part time workers. Flexible Schedule and a great face pace environtment
good,Starbucks is a great college job. They were really great with flexible schedules. I loved working with the customers and making every moment special for them
good,un trabajo agradable y ambiente de trabajo inmejorable
good,Great job but is 80% dependant on co-workers in a given shift. some people are awesome at doing the job and others do not care or try less others. But overall the job and benefits and everything else is great and fun but also a lot is your team members.
good,"A la apertura de tienda era hacer conteo de la caja chica, revisión general de tienda a fin de no tener contratiempos en servicio, asignación de cajas a Batista, apoyo a servicio al cliente, recepción de mercacias, generador de pedidos y horarios, "
good,Best part-time job experience available in my opinion. When you first start all the staff is extremely friendly and have a strong work culture. When working at this company it feels like you are with friends rather than just plain co-workers
good,"great place to grow and meet people in, fast paced by always people there to help and train. Learned a ton, great experience. Great perks. They take care of there employees."
good,"Fun place to work at, while being surrounded with good people. Definitely the worst customers show up at Starbucks, but luckily the environment is great to be in. Has great benefits as well."
good,This was a really fast paced and friendly work environment. Customers where mostly regulars and polite. Mangers where available and attentive to the employees needs most of the time. The benefits were excellent.
good,"Perhaps I just am not cut out to be a retail manager, I see many of my peers achieving goals and I am struggling to get by and keeping my staff happy."
good,fast paced moving a lot need to have lots of speed and lots of energy to work here but very fun great tips on the holidays and free coffee and food which is aplus
good,Really enjoyed working here. Great benefits and stock options. Great for students or a second job for people that need benefits. It is a company that cares about its employees and ir really big on customer service.
good,generalmente la empresa tiene un ambiente agradable y ameno.
good,Opening and closing duties.  Handcraft drinks according to every order.  Food handling.  Customer service.  Cash handling.  Supervisor duties.  Bar work. BOH work.
good,Starbucks in freehold raceway mall has the best staff I ever worked with. Everyone likes each other for the most part and we do our job while having fun. However we were understaffed a lot for such a busy store so it got very stressful being alone on bar and making a million drinks while customers complain and hover over you at the end of the counter.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks while I was there for my 2 year period.  I wanted to move up quicker in a company and with Starbucks it takes years and years for some partners.  I would recommend anyone to work there.  I learned a lot while working and I sometimes miss my regular customers that I talked to every day.  Interacting with customers was one of my favorite parts of working there, I always enjoyed making their day a little better."
good,My typical day at Starbucks was fast paced but came to a calm place. I learned how to work well with others also learn how to give out good customer service. The management was a little unorganized i didn't have a consist schedule and things in that manner. The hardest part is to work fast and also put the customer first. the most enjoyable part is the smile customers give me.
good,"Being that the location I work at is a drive-tru, it can get pretty hectic at times which can create a sense of chaos. But the partners that work there are nice and efficient at what they do."
good,"I worked at a Licensed store not Corporate, meaning the benefits and hours I worked are not the same as a typical Starbucks. I worked on a college campus Starbucks that was based on college students busy schedule. It was hard to balance with school but managers were flexible and very willing to work with employees instead of against."
good,its an ok job but you'll never get by without another job they do have nice benefits but over all more money is needed now more then ever if anything.
good,"It is a standard job, and I'm sure most people will not experience what I did at my location. "
good,Fun fast paced environment!  A great environment for learning the ins and outs of customer service.  the hardest part of the job was learning to multi task to keep up with customer demands.  the most enjoyable part was adapting to each customers exact demands and needs.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for! There are many perks to working there including part time benefits. It is a very fast paced position but you definitely get used to it. Management is well prepared and you are always given the right tools you need to succeed.
good,"I appreciate the benefits and the fact we are considered ""partners rather than just typical employees. Starbucks is a warm and inviting environment where individuals can drop their loads of stress and work and enjoy the best of the best."
good,"Working at starbucks was super fun. The only thing that's bad about starbucks is that you're starting pay is low compared to the work you have to do and the opportunity for advancement is pretty low. Even as a ""full time"" employee you only with 20-25 hours a week. Aside from those things starbucks has a great atmosphere and smells great !"
good,Love working for this company!! Dont intend to leave soon.  The employees are great to work with and the hours and holidays you get off and paid for are amazing!
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. I have learned more about customer service and management. This company provides excellent health benefits and stock options.
good,"It was always fun with co-workers but it could get very stressful during peak. Starbucks tries to be a ""good company"" but they still need to pay their employees more. They gave raises in 2017 but it still wasnt much. You're expected to supply phenomenal quality and speed and have certain drive-thru times but you can't control the customers' attitudes no matter how much you smile sometimes. Starbucks has become too commercialized and they need to make an environment for their employees where they WANT to come to work because they know they can trust their employer to back them up when a customer is being outrageous."
good,while working at Starbucks employees get a free pound of coffee
good,"Fast paced environment, flexible schedule, good benefits. Has good training and opportunity for development and advancement. Dealing with customers can be stressful."
good,It was a face paced location that required non stop hard work. The overall experience was great. However I do believe I should have a higher hourly based on how hard the work was.
good,The environment is quite welcoming and overall it is good to be working at this company where there are a lot to learn especially about the technology as the company specialized in IT software system
good,"A typical day at Starbucks can range from extremely dead, to a line out of the door. There are different rushes at different times of the day based on your location and hours. Typically, you will be making drinks, cleaning, and brewing coffee."
good,Les deux mois que j'ai passé au Starbucks m'ont parues comme six. L'emploi est stimulant mais très fatiguant. Faire du 40h là-bas c'est comme faire du 60h quelque part d'autre.
good,everything was always good and smooth the rushes wherealways good there was team work customers where great the drinks where also great i learned alot
good,"working at the store star bucks was a cool job, it did require a lot of movement and doing multiple things at once. and running two to three different sections at once"
good,"Target was my first job I worked with great people, and enjoyed coming into work each day, i met some awesome people and learned many things from them, the managers we're outstanding, and always helpful."
good,"I loved my manager. He was very understanding and easy to work with, but my coworkers were horrible. They would purposely call out the wrong drinks or add things to my drinks to make the order incorrect."
good,"I started working at one of the newest starbucks in MA, one with the drive thru. I really loved the working environment and the co-workers everyone was a great team. The only part that became frustrating was getting the food and drinks out as fast as you could while also having to serve the indoor customers with only one barista on the floor and at this specific Starbucks the manager would get upset if you stepped in to help. Management wasn't up to par. The most enjoyable part was seeing your same ol' customers who also became apart of your Starbucks family providing them with a smile with your great service."
good,It is a good place to work. I was an student and I had this part time. They were considered about my study days. I made a lot of friends and I learn a lot of things.
good,"Loved making coffee, and my team and customers were great.It is very easy to move up as long as you work hard, and know the right people. As a manager there is no work/life balance, just work."
good,Fast Pace work environment to get you thru the day. Never dull experience. Great benefits and opportunity to advance if you are willing to step up. Would recommend as a great place for employment for someone just starting out in their working career.
good,"My first 3 years at Starbucks in Las Vegas was the best first job you could have. My manager was sweet, caring of others outside obligations and all around a great manager. Working at the store (since it was right next to a Casino) was quick-paced and demanding. Since the customers were so understanding. It really made working there a great experience. "
good,Good company to work for and it comes with perks if you work at a Starbucks that's not licensed. Dress code allows you to show a side of your personality within the guidelines.
good,This is one of the only companies I've had the pleasure of working for that followed its values. Very much a people first company. Amazing benefits and great team of people.
good,Burada calismayi seviyordum yalniz sehir degisikligi nedeniyle ayrildim yukselme olanagi fazla
good,"The company strives to be environmentally friendly and ensure all aspects of the business, from crop growing to customer service, is directed with sustainable and fair practices."
good,"fun place to work, good coworkers and nice customers.  Learned managment skills, was given the option of flexible working hours, the quality of coffee was good"
good,I enjoyed the management team I was able to work with at Starbucks.  They made a point to me to speak up if I felt something wasn't working to the best of its' abilities.  Starbucks was also a great working environment to improve my customer service skills!  Customer satisfaction was a major priority at Starbucks
good,"This is a place for those who like the buzz in the air everyday. This place offers such competitive wages, and tips, room for advancement, recognition of good performances, and is a breeding ground for upbeat and positive family like culture. I loved this place and would not mind ever going back to work for this company. I love coffee. But beware there is a bit of coffee science introduced but it is all fun and love."
good,"typically I will run the shift, order supplies, organize where baristas are, deal with money such as balancing the safe and tills. i also take orders and make beverages."
good,"The job itself is so fun and very rewarding - if you can make it through what corporate puts you through.  If you can tough it out, it's the most fun job I've ever had.  Pays well for the type of job that it is.  Extremely flexible schedule, and you can easily switch around shifts and ask for time off."
good,"-communication with customers is key to a great experience,"
good,enjoyed working here. moving up is hard. but you gotta just keep pushing to get to your goals if you want to move up. lots of enthusiasm and friendly staff.
good,A typical day at Starbucks may be a steady flow of customers with slow moments here and there or there may be times where your whole shift is a steady rush of customers. Either way it is helpful to get comfortable with your fellow partners quick so that everyone can deliver high quality results that Starbucks demands. The most enjoyable and rewarding part about being a partner is being able to satisfy the customer's need even when you're making the moment right.
good,"Loved the job"
good,J ai eu la chance de pouvoir travailler dans une compagnie ou le bien être du personnel était mis en avant. La culture du thé est un domaine relaxant ou on a le temps de connecter avec client et partager une expérience unique.
good,"The employees were very kind and there were a lot of constructive people working there as well. The customers were very sweet and I had the pleasure of networking to make my reputation even greater. Management with worked with me while having trouble with some personal ailments. I am always welcome to reapply whenever possible to reinstate my position they said. There seems to be quality care in empathizing and empowerment which makes Harris Teeter the top choice. Glad I was a part of Harris Teeter!"
good,"Fun environment to work in. Can be stressful at times, but you build great relationships with customers and your coworkers. They work well with school schedules and provide numerous benefits."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you can keep up with a fast paced environment. A strong company that offers great benefits and chances to move up in your career.
good,"My manager created the best work environment and reeally cared about her employees. Not once did she take advantage of any employee, and still managed to keep the store sales top two in the district anually. We were a competitve, yet friendly store, all thanks to the leadership that my manager instilled in the work place."
good,"It was a fun place to work. Everyone is very friendly and most of them work very hard. The job can be stressful during peak times. As you can imagine, a LOT of people want coffee. So it can get pretty busy."
good,"a typical day at Starbucks is fast-pacing and very hardworking"
good,"Shifts at Starbucks vary from week to week and as a shift supervisor that means opening at 4 am and closing at 9 pm throughout the week. As a college student I find the variability making it hard to continue going to work as it wore me out. My store had a great culture and dedicated mind set. My manager was dedicated to our store and very supportive. While most customers are great and caring, there are a slight few that are unnecessarily rude, caused baristas to be uncomfortable, or find loopholes in the menu and take advantage of us. Overall it was a very fun job, I loved making drinks and latte art."
good,"Good team of partners and management, with the great customers to attend to on a daily. Some days can be stressful and other days it's not so bad.  Pay change recently isn't the best."
good,"Love the location.  We get regulars and tourist.  great vibe. "
good,"Overall good place to work, just dealing w/ rude customers is the only problem but the people you work with are great. Great benefits plus additional perks but it has a great work/life balance of only working you 8 hours a day, no overtime."
good,"A typical day at work includes various task from taking orders, cleaning, and my favorite making drinks. The hardest part of the job would be the intense moments where you have about 20 cafe drinks and 50 mobile drinks to make while a customer breathes down your neck but the pure adrenaline from the rush of busting out 10 drinks in under a minute pushes you through with a smile on your face to finish and connect with the customer and get right back to the bar machine because yes, 20 more mobile orders just popped out, forget about cleaning and you wont be able to stock until you're completely out of everything during rush. In all seriousness on a good day Starbucks is quite enjoyable drinks are fun to make and people can be nice, the work is relatively easy once you get used to it, tips are pretty good, as well as recognition, lastly  once you are an efficient barista the job is really easy. The best part would be Spotify Premium however a slight raise would be nice."
good,The training for this company was really great I definitely learned a lot there. The pay was good for what it was and they had very flexible hours. The people were great and it had a comfortable work environment
good,The job is very fast paced and you must be able to multitask. The job is very rewarding and the benefits are unbeatable. I very much enjoy my time working for Starbucks.
good,The work at Starbucks can honestly be very stressful. While there are sometimes customers who are truly a nightmare. Most of the time it's really nice to see someone smile and to make connections with people as they drink a cup of coffee
good,"worked here while in high school, good place for high school students/college/straight outta high school. The store I was in was pretty relaxed, yes it gets hectic at certain points in the day but there was some down time of just repeated cleaning."
good,It was fun and a good time. I was often left alone to run the front end. Assisted all guests and made all drinks for them. Management was great. Great environment.
good,he workplace is a better place to be when you have the opportunity to take on one of your co-workers in a quick competition or do a little trash talking after a meeting. Ping pong is fun and makes employees happy.
good,Good company with great ethics; job satisfaction really depends on team members and management. Can be stressful at times but an overall regular flow of customers. Pay could be better.
good,"Food and customer service is always difficult, but coworkers made it fun and relaxed. Coffee shops tend to be busy in the morning, so it can get stressful."
good,Starbucks is amazing opportunity to get into the work force. They have great management and provide some some the best training in the industry.  I started off as a barista and ended up as a shift supervisor.  I would return to working at Starbucks in  heart beat
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks until I transferred to a different store. The management was severely lacking so it made my coming to work feel worthless.
good,Spent 5 years working for this company and it helped me grow a lot as a person and taught me how to balance between task roles and team roles. Would recommend this job to anyone who likes to work as a team or learn leadership skills.
good,"Decent place to work, good culture. You must buy into their mission statement completely. The ones who do are very successful because they are in line with expectation."
good,"Un ambiente de trabajo muy dinámico, joven, activo y profesional."
good,"I think the hardest part of the job is having patience with customers specially during rush hours. You can get a lot of angry customers who are not happy about waiting for their orders. Sometimes it's not your fault. Example, the sticker machine was broken or an order got lost.  There are also times where you just happen to ran out of that one food item, and will have to ask the customer if they would like a refund or an another item. If you are at drive thru, sometimes the customers will add an order at the window, which causes everyone's time to be added on. So It's not always your fault. However, keeping it positive during a rush is very important. Your shift leader and manager will be there to help you if you ever need a small break to gather yourself."
good,"had to learn fast, management was nice and friendly. some customers suck but that happens everywhere. there was definitely a lot to remember with how many different drinks"
good,Good company to work for if you enjoy working and building connections with people from different ways of life. Busy environment.Can get stressful if management is not the best.
good,I am currently at Starbucks but do intend on leaving. Their fast pace environment is not for everyone but I enjoyed it for my time being. I have been at Starbucks for 4 years and what I have noticed most is that they run very smoothly as long as everyone does their part and the managers know what they are doing.
good,I enjoyed working at the Starbucks fast Pace environment Starbucks offer new products every season the company always keep products fresh i enjoyed learning the Starbucks language.
good,Very flexible with scheduling. Good work environment. Never tired because you are so caffeinated. The culture at Starbuck's if relaxed and they encourage you to move up in the company.
good,Working at Starbucks you meet so many people and it's a very cultural place to work. They are very helpful to the community and when I was at work I actually enjoyed the day. The hardest part of the job would be running constantly and accidently messing up a drink because it throws you backward. Overall I enjoyed the job I just didn't have room for advancement.
good,"Serve customers 90% workload, Admin/scheduling 10%.Excel"
good,"A typical day consisted of several tasks depending on where the manager on shift needed you. I mainly focused on cashier work where you have to greet the customers, take their orders and make them feel like they were well taken care of. I learned through customer service and interaction how to deal with difficult situations, how to grow as a whole while helping my team and to polish my multitasking skills during rush hours. The workplace culture was very friendly and helpful by helping others thrive you excelled as well. The hardest part of the job was dealing with many different things going on at once it was a very fast paced job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make someone's day through good service and reaping the benefits of working hard."
good,The people are awesome and there is so much to do that the shift goes by quickly.  The company itself is great and there are many perks to working for such a large company.
good,"Disponibilidad, cordialidad, trabajo en grupo, amabilidad"
good,"Una gran organización con grandes posibilidades de crecimiento, se trabaja con un sistema de incentivos muy atractivo en cargos gerenciales. Mucha exigencia de respuesta inmediata que llega a invadir la vida personal de los empleados."
good,"ambiente agradável"
good,I wanted to work for Starbucks so I pursued a position.  Still a big fan.  Benefits are great.  Environment was fun and creative.  Worked my way up into a management position.
good,"Despite having incredibly difficult and self absorbed customers, it's bearable with the right crew. The benefits and perks daily are really helpful. The incentives and the team make it worth it."
good,"I making coffee drink stocking  coffee beans, i learn how to listen to"
good,"The company really wants to focus on diversity, work life balance and growing their employees.  The problem is no all the managers are following this."
good,"Well meaning people, but extremely passive culture. if you are looking for an innovative culture. Look elsewhere. Most roles are highly operational and execution-based"
good,"En estos últimos siete años, desde que comencé como estudiante en la universidad, me ha permitido desarrollarme profesionalmente."
good,"The work is fun and quick paced. Not worth the little pay and dealing with customers attitudes. Great co-workers and decent benefits but low pay. Usually a positive environment good skill since you can move and transfer to other Starbucks, very steady job.  Hardest part is in the beginning just understanding drinks. Once you catch on you will have it for life. The coffee mark outs and 401K benefits are great!"
good,"I will go to my workplace 10 minutes before I start my shift, so I can make myself a coffee and prepare myself for work by changing into my uniform. On the shift there will be 4/5 team members and 1 team leader, who will allocate our roles during the day. I will then take my position on the tills and start serving customers and providing the best customer service. Having a friendly approached towards a customer is great, as we received many foreigners from other country and helping them to decide on the items they want, always puts a smile on their face and mine as I receive many praises. However, hardest part of the job is being quick and effective during our peak times. This is because the store itself is very small and we are also dealing with hot beverages, therefore we must consider health safety procedure. In addition, it is a lovely place to work in as it has helped and improved my customer service skills and also, has made me more creative as when making a hot beverage I like to create patterns."
good,Improvent needs to be made with team building and communication with managment  would perfer more one on one time to grow as a company needs more focus on training all baristas new or past.
good,"We were a fast paced busy Starbucks, always had a line of customers we worked well together and helped each other out.  We always recognized holidays and special dates for each other we became friends and had each others backs."
good,"Work environment is great and its a people centric company and "
good,"Wonderful environment. They definitely set the trends in the coffee industry. You can expect a good product with an even better work life balance. If you love coffee culture, this is a great place to be."
good,great place to work while going to school. Made many friends and enjoyed the environment. at first training is hard because there is so much to take in but after it is a breeze.
good,"load and unload product with forklift, sort and store product, wrap and ready for shipment, load shipment on trucks for the shipments to other stores."
good,"Typical work day can start at any time. Depending on what time of day, it could start really busy and taper off or just stay pretty busy throughout your shift. Overall not too hard of a job, just not the best pay."
good,"I love to work as barista at Starbucks Tambun bcause i love to serve customer, almost my customer very friendly. I can learn how to be barista, and sometime cashier. My management also good and understanding. We work as a team and help each other."
good,Good place to work for both full time and part time jobs. I would like to work only with contract based job but i am done with my contract with Starbucks.
good,The best place to work with people start off as co workers and become friends. learn about the different types of coffee and flavors. you can make it hot or cold.
good,If you like coffee and a fast paced environment than this is the job for you. Depending on the location you will likely earn more than the average rate for the same work elsewhere.
good,"It is definitely a quick paced environment where you deal with a lot of customers. I enjoy being able to make these daily connections. Although I do feel that Starbucks is currently trying too hard to stay trendy with a lot of the bright colored, super artificial drinks."
good,"Was a fun work environment. All companies have areas where they could improve, this however was a very fun job to have. I enjoyed my experience there."
good,"Starbucks was fun. It was a nice job to get fresh out of high school and taught me a lot in terms of multitasking and customer skills. Management was a little uptight and could do with a restructuring. I felt as a lowly barista, my opinions or suggestions weren't taken seriously."
good,This by far has been one of the funnest places I have worked for throughout my work experience thus far. I have met some of my closest friends here whether they be co workers or customers who became friends.
good,"Starbucks is full of active and ambitious people. They demand a lot from themselves, however they also do from everyone else. It is not easy to fit in. My role is to run the shift according to the company standards. It means I have to make sure that my baristas are well trained and know what to do to deliver the right products and service. The best part of the job is meeting our regular customers. It is one of these wonderful moments when you do not have to do anything and the perfect service naturally happens itself. However, there are plenty of customers every day, sometimes also VIPs like famous people or Starbucks top managers. I believe this is the hardest part of the job. I find it very stressful. I have to admit, I actually have learned a lot at Starbucks. I developed my organizational skills, improved punctuality, became more self-confident person."
good,The pay is pretty trash but the benefits are awesome. Great atmosphere with your coworkers. I would recommend this job for anybody as their first job or for somebody in college or someone who is retired and needs something part time on the side.
good,"Working here gave me the opportunity to work around my studies. it helped grow as a person and the team pushes you to strive for more. Its a well organised establishment, with regular friendly customers who engage well and comment on the outstanding customer service."
good,"Worked there for 5 months, learned how to better communicate with people and overcame social anxiety. Friendly staff and lots of opportunities to learn and grow."
good,"Starbucks gives extremely good benefits, even for part time. As long as you work about 20 hours a week, you're eligible for discounted health, vision, and dental insurance. Other than insurance, there is 401k and free restricted stocks through Fidelity, free Spotify premium, and sick hours and vacation hours.It is very stressful though, from working weird hour patterns, to managing time in a fast pace environment, there is always something to think a head on. Since I usually work evenings, it feels like I'm always picking up things."
good,"I really enjoyed this job and I really did not want to leave, but my hours dwindled down to practically nothing after the holiday season and I wasn't able to support my family."
good,I immediately felt like I belonged when I started working for Starbucks. Great place to meet new people and to discuss great things with people who you thought never to talk to.
good,A work day would involve me refilling supplies and washing the dishes. It was still a cool environment to work in as you get to see how the coffee or drink is made.
good,Very good company to gain reputable experience. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone! The benefits were outstanding. The work environment is very fun and relaxed.
good,A typical day is relatively fast paced compared to most jobs. There are few pauses in the day. It is a fun work environment with an actual connection to customers.
good,"Working with Starbucks kept me on my toes. The team I was working with was friendly, helping each other out was apart of our daily ritual. I learned how to create traditional American coffees, which varied from European coffee recipes.  It was a fulfilling work experience in both mental and social experience."
good,This place is only nice to work at if you are looking for afternoon or night time positions. The crew in the morning versus the crew at night is way different. I personally think the crew at night is better and more cool with each other.
good,I enjoyed this job opening the store training individuals and the customers where like family. The perks of taking home a pound a week was fantastic.  Until we had to close the store.
good,Good job security excellent work environment good team spirit highly motivated team members good customers excellent spirit nice colleagues wonderful management
good,"Starbucks is great for someone who likes fast paced work, and coffee. Starbucks has wonderful benefits tailored to any individual. You will learn to work efficiently and under stress."
good,I enjoy my workmates as well as the customers. The hours I was getting was at a minimum so I had to move on. Aside from making drinks all you really do is clean all day.
good,"A typical day at work includes:"
good,"A lot of my days started and ended the same as a barista/supervisor. I would manage money during my opening and closings but also before shift changes to the next supervisor coming in where they would also check and manage the money to  double check all is as it says in the cash log. "
good,"Got along with coworkers well, always given breaks when needed, treated ethically. Was challenging at times but rewarding. Bonded with coworkers and customers. Enjoyed doing Drive Thru."
good,"Partners that worked here for many years often feel entitled, but many are really great. Always push your partners past their comfort zone to grow! The culture is either totally there or not at all. It depends on how each manager runs their store."
good,Only worked morning shifts since i attend school in the afternoons. very flexible on scheduling. Would recommend for any student. Work environment was relaxed.
good,"Connecting with customers is mostly a joy, and the kind of people attracted to working in the industry mean that most of the time you're likely to enjoy your working environment. In recent times the sheer number of promotional activities has made the day to day focuses a little blurry and unclear."
good,"being a barista is a great second job. Unless you want to be a Manager, this job will not pay all your bills. My take away from this job is the customer service. I believe that every customer deserves an good experience. The power of a smile is under rated."
good,I typical work day consists of taking care of customer needs and store maintenance. I learned how to work in a face-paced environment as a team and be effective in sales. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers drinks to perfection and ensuring their satisfaction.
good,i like taking care of customer and treat employees with respect. my main focus on every time i go to work is to make sure im ready to do what Ive been told to do.
good,Starbucks Coffee has been an excellent company to work for in the past and present. This position has taught me leadership and integrity. I am thankful for the experience I have gained working for the company.
good,Enjoyed working here but don't think i got paid enough for everything i did.  Learned a lot about customer service and learned to better my working skills/ethic.
good,"Un día tipico en mi trabajo era el de llegar, abrir la tienda, desde prender todo hasta ingresar pedidos y realizar inventario, así como hacer el cierre de la tienda."
good,"This job is fun, fast-paced, and is great for those who like to have human interaction. I will say this however, not all locations are created equal, and some locations aren't as well set-up, or run as smoothly as others, but as long as you can keep up, and enjoy crafting beverages (and don't mind cleaning her and there) this is a great place for you. They have some great benefits, including health/dental, paid vacation time, and a partnership with ASU that will help pay tuition if you attend."
good,"It was nice working with this company. As my first job in customer service industry it really challenge me as a person and in line with that, it has helped me grow and so much learning to take me in my future endeavor. "
good,"I enjoyed working at starbucks. It was a great way to interface with your local community. The job requires you to be quick thinking and very organized. I hope you like people, because you get some odd ducks every now and then."
good,"It's a fair place to work, but don't expect to have freedom to run your business as you want. Standards are high, but you can be proud of your career."
good,"Fairly easy job, good perks, and atmosphere. Coworkers can be dramatic as with customers, but that's any retail job. Benefits are good but pay could be better considering my tenure (4 years)."
good,I wouldn't work there again only because of the pay scale and lack of intelligence needed to perform the job. I loved the fast pace and attitude of the co workers.
good,Working in Starbucks is an advantage for me. I've learned many things in terms professional and personal aspects. The partners are very friendly and helpful.
good,Have to be quick and attentive but the environment is always friendly and my coworker were some of my favorite people I've ever met. ..................
good,"if you're looking for a fast paced job this is the place to be. working here you need to be able to catch on  real quick. "
good,"The location of where you plan to work does have an impact. My location had great and positive culture, the best team i would possibly ever work with."
good,It was my first job out of school and I enjoyed it a lot. It is a great company to work for if you end up with a good group around you. Great benefits.
good,Starbucks Coffee Company is a great company to work for. They have great health coverage that covers things such as fertility and transgender services. Having a supportive district manager makes all the difference. Focus' on the human connection and takes pride in their involvement with the community and helping those in need.
good,Making Drinks and having conversation with customers are great. The people are great to work with. I love my boss and how he works to help all his employees.
good,"I started working at Starbucks during college for the flexible schedule and better that average pay. I enjoyed my time there and usually felt like I was valued as an employee. However, upper management will not hesitate to side with an irate customer to save face."
good,"awesome manager, awesome people, awesome customers. really liked working here. these people became family to me . unfortunately, I had to leave here suddenly and I regret how I left to this day."
good,"it was pretty interesting working at Starbucks, there co-workers were like family, we had respect for one another. as well as looking out for each other."
good,"The workday can be a bit stressful depending on your location. Starbucks is a great place to work if you enjoy seeing new faces and interacting with different personalities. You will encounter every type of customer at this job. You are there for the customer and they come in for you. The partner-guest interaction is the most important part. Advantages include good health benefits, PTO, sick days, etc."
good,Great place. Great benefits. Discounts. Insurance. Management makes quick decisions that impact multiple people with no notice. Can't keep staffed with store managers.
good,loved working there kind of quick paced but workable and not to hard on your body. i enjoyed talking to customers and knew how to listen even to the rude ones. all in all would say it was a very enjoyable experience.
good,"Training was great. Pay was great. Management was great. Environment was family-oriented, friendly, and great. No problem giving great customer service."
good,Starbucks is a fantastic place to begin working. It teaches you how to be personable and how to better deal with stressful situations. Great for customer service experience.
good,Very busy and fast paced environment. Was put on drive through during rush. Left handed. Kind management and nicer people. Very picky about their coffee
good,"Working at Starbucks was delightful. A typical day included being on your feet majority of the time. Taking customers orders with a good attitude while keeping the line moving as quickly as possible. From time to time switches are made when shift arrives depends on how busy it gets. Working on register, bar, or stocking everything that is needed for a coffee shop to run. I learned a lot working under pressure, keeping a cool attitude even if I am right the customer is always right and while keeping in mind it's coffee at the end of the day. Though it a simple job one gets to meet individuals that captures ones heart. Management will work with one's schedule as long as the employee is meeting works needs with arriving on time, ect. The work culture is a fast place one working as a team is a plus and makes shifts go by fast and fun. I enjoyed talking to the customers in the morning rush catching up about their while taking orders was always fun."
good,It's a solid job part time or full-time. I worked as a musician and kept this part time and the culture there was good as was the pace of a normal workday.
good,Working at Starbucks is great if you are passionate about people.  The people I had the chance to work with were always very nice.  I made friends with many co workers as well as regular customers.
good,"Working at Starbucks had its ups and downs however I found that I had a good experience making coffee and getting to know the customers.  Work was never a place I dreaded going to as I found comfort in my job, which was to make coffee. The shift managers were very friendly and helpful for the most part and the workplace culture was one that I felt very comfortable in. Occasionally there is that one customer that gives you a hard time however handling situations like that help you grow as a person and partner. The most enjoyable part of the Job was building relationships both with my coworkers and customers."
good,"Starbucks is wonderful company to work for. The benefit packages for those interested are good, the breaks are fair, and the community and atmosphere makes the job not feel like you're working constantly."
good,Starbucks diğer sektörlere oranla sartlari cok iyi yükselme kariyer yapabilmen kendini gosterdikten sonra ilerlemen kolay oluyor. Fakat ucret konusunda kazandirdigin kadar hakkettigin ucreti vermiyorlar calisan magaza ve calismayan magaza da ayni ucreti aliyor. Bu konu beni cok rahatsiz ediyor
good,Management  is not good partners are rude could use better team work all together but over all the job was good the drinks are the best part memorizing them along with making them
good,"A typical day at work was fun, I always left with a smile on my face because I knew I made all my customers happy. However, I found the rush and need for speed could be quite paralyzing to me and I became stressed after a certain period."
good,"Love the company and culture - they really focus on customer service and quick delivery of quality products. Great benefits and job perks (schedule flexibility, discounts, free drinks/food/Spotify, stock option) but mediocre hourly pay. However, working with a younger team is a blast and customers can be great."
good,Place is flexible and helps make it easy to gonto school. They have great benefits and the workload is not only doable but manageable. They give you many different opportunities to grow within the company
good,"Une cohésion d’équipe a toute épreuve, ou tout le monde s'aide et ou tout le monde apprend des compétences de l'autre."
good,"Una empresa de clase mundial con el buen trato hacia los clientes, manejando estándares de limpieza y orden así como en ventas, me parece una gran oportunidad de crecimiento y me parece una gran marca para trabajar."
good,"Very easy going, back then, don't know about it now. But when I worked, it was fun, relaxing, but very demanding. Made time go by quickly, and so do the nice people."
good,The management was poor when I started the job until we got new management. When new management came in there were bias actions that caused me move on to a better opportunity. I became a Batista and it was an awesome task.
good,Loved my time at Starbucks. Management was excellent and customers even better. Overall a great environment made the day go by. Not to mention the coffee was amazing!
good,"The culture is matched from the store level, all the way through to the upper management team. There is a great opportunity for creative career advancement."
good,Its fun to serve . Strict working hours. So rest of the time u can enjoy. We can visit various place because of work. Friendly staff. We forget we are workkin
good,"Grato clima laboral, gerentes muy amables y serviciales."
good,"Extremely busy, learned to satisfy customers excellent management culture was a beautiful environment closeting duties, enjoyed working others shifts."
good,"On a typical work day I would pick up a lot of the slack. I work very well at a fast pace which my team had difficulty keeping up with. Because of this, I was able to develop as a leader and my daily tasks included delegating and overseeing that business ran smoothly."
good,"A great workplace for people going to school. Your never bored. It is definitely a high pressured work environment, so you always have to be at your A game."
good,"Starbucks is Fast-Paced environment, were order accuracy is crucial, as having one mess up can set you back by a significant amount. The customers connections are some of the best parts, Starbucks Consumers get a bad wrap, but at the end of the day if you're good at making their coffee its pretty enjoyable as its always nice when some one compliments you on your skills as a barista. It really helps if you and you're team get along it makes the job that more enjoyable."
good,"I particularly enjoyed executing the Starbucks mission of giving our customers human connection. Moving forward, I learned to conduct myself more professionally while completely being myself. The hardest part of my job would be learning cadences, when the most enjoyable turned out to be why these cadences made the best coffee I love."
good,Barista position is great if you are a college or in school.  Slightly over worked but able to par take in perks the store offers.  They do train you in obtaining legendary customer service and it is over all a great company to learn that in.
good,I love that every day is very much the same but so different. The company does an amazing job mixing it up and growing their leadership base. Great company to work for!
good,While working at Starbucks it was important to take the time to welcome and greet each customer. Multitasking was an important skill to practice. Management always did what they could to help us meet the standard. The part that i didn't enjoy so much was making Frappuccino's all day. I enjoyed all of the people I was able to interact with and provide customer service.
good,"Although it may get stressful at times, for the most part it's pretty fun! I usually love the people I am working with and if I decide to travel to another province there is always opportunity to transfer to another Starbucks with out any issues."
good,Working at Starbucks was the most fun job I ever had. It wasn't easy though; there was a lot to remember and the standards were high. The company expected a complete commitment to their vision and the challenge was something that I accepted and tried my best to achieve.
good,I loved my experience working here. the staff were very welcoming. the hours were excellent and i wouldnt see myself working anywhere else because i love the company.
good,"Great job for all those coffee drinking people persons out there. The only place where you're encouraged to conversate and build relationshis with customers. Very fast paced so not typically the place for those who can't handle the stress of fast food...or beverage I should say. Multitasking is a must, and you can't be afraid to get dirty because you will come home with some kind of mizture of coffe/tea/milk/lemonade/syrup splatters on you. Aside from that it's an enjoyable atmosphere If your managers know how to run a shift properly. One free food item per shift and free beverages thirty minutes before, on your breaks, and up to 30 minutes after your shift. One free item a week such as coffee beans, tea, instant coffees or teas, things like that. When your not working you get a thirty percent off at any store. Lots of perks, they offer benifits, as well as a share in stock."
good,Definitely not a hard job. You meet a lot of different people. Of course it is busy most of the times...its Starbucks. Funnest part of the job is making up different drinks to try.
good,My work experience was amazing. My coworkers were easy to get along with and helped me when I had questions. The company overall is amazing. However my last manager there had cut back my hours for a week and I only came in on the weekend
good,The demand for coffee is real. This job was fast fun and great. I had to quit due to moving but this company was a good one that really cared about their employee and made sure of it
good,"Greet customers and take orders for coffee, tea and other drinks made to customer specifications."
good,"I came to know Starbucks first by working in a licensed Barnes and Noble Cafe. I have now worked at a corporate Starbucks since October 2015 and I experienced the change in pay, labor, and management. The culture and rapport with customers is gone, to be replaced by a drive for low drive through times. It became quantity over quality."
good,This job is fpr those who like and enjoy a fast-paced environment. You must remember tons of recipes to make over and over again. Your shift goes by quickly because of how fast everything is.
good,"i would love to to come into work everyday because i would be excited to see my regulars, it is a fast paced environment, at least when i was there, it was fairly easy to learn the drinks. and i learned a lot about coffee, i used to think it all tasted the same, i would even drink old coffee that had been left out for hours at old jobs, until i learned what a good fresh brewed coffee tasted like. honestly the hardest part of the job for me was dealing with co workers who didn't want to be there. and i did have a manager who had a bad attitude but she didn't last long."
good,"It is a corporation with standards and a specific way of doing things however it's a really fun and great place to work. They have great benefits and if you love coffee this is seriously a wonderful place. Yes it's pay is similar to other corporate lower level jobs like retail and fast food however they have such a good atmosphere and you get tips that is averaged out by work hours and that is given weekly as cash. You get a free meal when you work and unlimited drinks while you work. They have good breaks anode course the weekly market everyone gets which is a free pound of coffee or tea or keurigs etc. The take home stuff basically. They have lots of flexibility too. If you are looking for a job full or part time it is definitely the place to go. It has some similar feels to fast food but it's not quite the same and don't get the idea that it is. It's more about drinks which are fun to make and connecting with customers. You can really have a good time working here. Career opportunities might be a tad limited as you would really need to be good at selling and engaging with customers and know their procedures to move up but it's definitely not a bad option. High level positions would most likely be in Seattle unfortunately so store level and regional management are about the gist of the job. They do a background check and you will work with so many types of people from regular workers with no career goals to people who  are working on their master degrees. You generally are a barista and what the main jobs are are cashier, store support (brew coffee on a cycle, check the cafe"
good,"A typical day at work would be steady, I've learned a lot being here. Management can be a little better. The hardest part about the job is dealing with rude customers, the best part is connecting and getting to know every customers name and order that come in."
good,My recent manager has been a joy to work with and alongside. We typically have many changes in management and with that comes changes within the team. I've been able to maintain my set schedule and the perks aren't bad at all either!
good,"Its a good environment and if you dedicate yourself to hard work and team vulture, you can have great success as a barista for starbucks. The only thing that could be better is overall work morale."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place to work if you want to be a part of a team that cares about you. I always feel supported and like I'm helping someone every single day. Of course, it is fast paced and stressful at times, but the good times outweigh the bad by far. The hardest part of the job is time management. Corporate has understandable labor goals that sometimes leave us understaffed, but we always pull together and work with 110%."
good,"this is a great place to work for students due to the fact that most baristas only work 12-18 hours a week depending on the store. Also , most shifts are 4 hours starting off. The managers and supervisors get most of the hours and the longest shifts."
good,"Customer demands are heaviest at mornings, requiring a job well done and production maximization needed along with rotation of responsibilities. Time flies and before you know it, you are home."
good,the starbucks way is the best way! no really training with this company is amazing . however depending who your manager is can make or break you experience with starbucks. when it comes to pay it honest and fair.
good,The most enjoyable part of working there are the people that you work with. I've gotten to know so many wonderful people working here. The hardest part is learning the drinks but once you get the hang of it you will do just fine.
good,"Even though I worked at a Starbucks in a mall it was still a fast-paced environment. Management wasn't all that great but overall it's a great company to work for. I wasn't given enough hours to receive benefits. Due to limited hours, I want to find a full time job so I can receive the benefits I need."
good,"Starbucks provides you with the the basic customer service training and experience you need to advance yourself further within another field. Great as a first job, but I wouldn't stay unless I wanted to advance into higher management."
good,"I loved my time at Starbucks. Fun work environment, free coffee, a free meal every shift. I didn't use the other benefits because I didn't need them, but I love how Starbucks provides pretty great benefits and has a deal with ASU to get a free online education while employed. "
good,"Starbucks is a great fast paced place to work, with many good benefits such as discounts and vacation time. Also college tuition programs. They have flexibility in their hours."
good,Loved working for this company. My store manager was super friendly. Recommend working for this company only if you enjoy interactions with customers.
good,Make sprints at Starbucks was amazing a very fast-paced environment great music good people great coffee free drinks I just love that much fun but unfortunately I was just too big for the small environment so I had to find something bigger and better.
good,"One of the best places to work for! There are some cons - like every job placement, but this place was the best. There are times when employees don't have an idea of what their doing and don't try to fix that, and some managers aren't aware of what to do with their management position. Other than that; Starbucks is one of the best places to work for."
good,"I loved working here you get a lot of benefits working here for this company, you become like a family with your work crew and it was fun and productive as well, You can grow in this company"
good,"My typical day at work is dealing with call ins, making sure all employees arrive to work on time and business is opened on time on the daily.  The hardest part is working when you are short handed.  The enjoyable part is my employees. They are the reason why I am here at this company."
good,Starbucks is overall a fun environment to work in. There's never a dull moment between making drinks and caring for costumers. Working at Starbucks has taught me to go above and beyond for our costumers. The hardest part of the job would be working with uncooperative and uncommunicative coworkers. If I were in a position to manage I would make sure my baristas were properly trained and I would have my team communicate their daily struggles/accomplishments so we could achieve our common goal.    What I enjoy most about my job is seeing my daily customers and helping Starbucks become better with every drink.
good,I love the culture at Starbucks and it would be a great first job. Its a neat experience when learning about costumer service and and just a overall good place to meet people and get to know your costumers. I was alright with the hours but it is a lot of work! You do get paid very well for what you are doing and can be pretty easy to move up if you put your mind to it.
good,"Over all the job is pretty much what you would expect it to be. Fastpace at times, and slow at others. co-workers were amazing and the job was incredibly fun. Overall it was a great workplace."
good,"Always helps employees feel comfortable and preform a safe working environment for employees. flexible, organized, and good management. preform good customer service skills."
good,"Everyday is different and everyday is busy."
good,"Es una empresa que te permite desarrollar tus habilidades sociales, ya que tienes que estar en constante contacto con los clientes. Asimismo, aprendes a trabajar en equipo, a ser solidario con tus compañeros y clientes."
good,Very fast paced but the customer's great feedback make everything worth it. The ability to be able to make someone's morning or day by delighting them with great service and a beverage is something worth doing.
good,"A typical day at work is to begin my work day at whatever position my shift supervisor gives me, whether it be: customer support, bar, front point of sale or drive-thru. Our team cleans the store while preparing drinks while maintaining a level of genuine connections with our customers. I have learned how to: form connections with regular customer base, educate baristas on correct form of making drinks, up-sell a specific item to customers, and cash handling. The management at my current location is one that I personally adore and respect wholeheartedly. The work place culture is one of the up and comings, the new and developing. The hardest parts of the job are the stress level and the monotonous everyday that tends to blend together after being a partner after several years. The most enjoyable part of the job is the connections that I have made with the partners as well as the customers that I see every day."
good,Skills learned while working at Starbucks are applicable for various other jobs. Fast-paced with a coworkers that feel like family. Working one's way up through the company is not super difficult if you are motivated and express interest in moving up the managerial ladder.
good,"Brand and place in market is amazing, leadership visionary and inspiring. Fantastic people. Day to day on the job is facing growing pains - organization has become top heavy and not seasoned enough to empower middle management. Culture is collaborative on the verge of consensus-driven, could do with a heavier dose of accountability across the organization."
good,"this job is very fast pace."
good,this was a  great   work  experience . i got    to   learn great    customer skills  here.  management        was very supportive and reliable .i would  work  there     again
good,I learned to multitask and to be able to do five hundred things at once. The hardest part of the job has to be able to keep calm when customers get angry for no reason.
good,Really fun place to work that allows you to be creative and your absolute self. A great place to work if you are a student (they'll even help you get your degree)
good,"Good place to work, especially if you need benefits. Starbucks is a great company that offers its employees many resources. Baristas are paid above minimum wage."
good,Starbucks provides health benefits at 20 hours a week. Environment is fast-paced with occasional challenges. Vacation hours are earned after one year with 15 hours worked equally 1 hour of vacation time.
good,"I worked with a great team, we worked very well together. I made drinks as a barista, cleaned the Back of house as well as front of house, expo, fifo."
good,a typical day at work is always busy many customers come in and we serve them. we learn customer service and team building skills. and how to work efficiently with others.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for while in school as it offers flexible hours. It teaches you how to multitask and customer service skills will be perfected on the job. Interacting with people on a daily basis becomes a norm and great relationships with customers can be made and networks can grow. The hardest part of the job was all the learning that was done on the job - making drinks, multitasking, ensuring customers are happy leaving the store and interacting with customers while one is having a busy day. The best thing about working at Starbucks is the friends and relationships you make along the way. Your team will eventually be the ones who get you through a rough day and you will never forget your regular customers - good or bad."
good,"Working for Starbucks has always been fun for me. They provide great benefits, healthcare, college, 401 K, etc. You really get to personalize with each customer and build lasting connections."
good,"Un ambiente agradable donde existe respeto entre todos los compañeros, una pregunta da cultura del café donde nos cultivados sobre todo lo relacionado con el café que trabajamos, una deliciosa experiencia donde aprendes de los demás y conoces nuevas formas de trabajar en equipo e individual."
good,"My experience in Starbucks coffee shop as a Barista is very satisfying, fun and productive. I love the working environment and the management. There is always new ideas and experience everyday."
good,"You meet a lot of people, customers and co-workers. Benefits include drinks on your shift, 1 food item, and a pound of coffee a week. Hardest part of the job is the drive thru."
good,it taught me skills that i could take home and use in my own kitchen. when we were our busiest. it helped you serve over 50 customers in less than an hour.
good,"Nice environment and great employees. Easy work lots of overtime. Free coffee. Long breaks. Positive and hard working, intelligent, and honest supervisors."
good,It is a great place to work because of the flexible schedule and benefits. The work required is more than a normal food service job. More than just making coffee
good,Not bad. I liked my manager and enjoyed my job. It wasn't where I wanted to be at that point in my life. I prefer to work with the arts than than in the food service industry.
good,"I really enjoy what Starbucks strives for. They also offer great benefits. There were time where we would be short staffed and no one was willing to  help so that was frustrating but, we really worked together as a team and leaned on each other."
good,Starbucks is just a great workplace.  There is the potential for advancement and fair and balanced pay.  But if you don't want to climb the corporate ladder don't feel obligated to.  Starbucks is also a great place to work in the meanwhile when you're trying to get into a different career altogether. Great job.
good,Le Starbucks dans le quel je travaille se situe à La Défense c'est l'un des meilleurs Starbucks de france en matière de chiffre et résultat en France . En y travaillant j'ai cultivé le goût du challenge et le dépassement de soi pour atteindre nos chiffres mais les possibilités d'évolution sont restreints et j'ai besoin de changement d'environnement . C'est pour cela que je déménage à Perpignan.
good,It is a fast paced environment but with the help of the co-workers you can be at ease and work efficiently. Everyone is friendly and able to work together as a team.
good,"Working at Starbucks has been cool. It has its ups and downs, but everyone is very team oriented and doesn't let one step on the other. It is a good job for someone looking for room to grow and something fairly easy."
good,"Goals were high and sometimes unattainable"
good,"Every day was fun and productive. I learned great customer service skills and how to operate an espresso machine. The management was excellent, always finding new ways to be productive. The environment was always positive. There were no hard parts at this job. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers and the personal relationships you create."
good,Travail répétitif mais agréable. Cette expérience a été très enrichissante et enjouée. Il m'a permis d'améliorer mon service à la clientèle.
good,"I work at a high volume Starbucks and although the environment is stressful, I still wish I had more hours."
good,Depending On The Store Manager. Its A Good Place To work. I Loved Working Here In The Earlier Days before It Became All about Food And Sales It was More About The Customer Experience and Fast paced working. I loved It. Now Its All About Store Managers Getting Over On You
good,i didnt qctually work at starbucks i worked at a mini starbucks in my school and made starbucks drinks but it was a good experience and a lot of fun to work there
good,"My time at Starbucks was mostly enjoyable. It was hard work, but it was a good way to make some extra money. The regular customers were wonderful,as were my coworkers and my manager. Starbucks doesn't always take into consideration how complicated the drinks are when they roll-out new items or how much extra work certain promotions such as ""Frappucino Happy Hour"" make, but the day to day experience was positive."
good,"Although the job can be extremely stressful at times, my coworkers make coming into work worth it. I think upper management definitely needs improvement, but the benefits and perks we get as partners are great. Overall, I have a positive experience at this position."
good,i really have little to complain about. most of my qualms were personal. if youre out of highschool or looking for a part time job while in college. this is one of the first locations i would look
good,"Working at Starbucks can be a great experience, depending on what you make of it. Great benefits, decent hours, and my co-workers care. Pay could be better but in conjunction with the numerous benefits and discounts they offer, the pay really isn't too bad. Being on your feet and the customer service aspect can be incredibly tiring but also very rewarding. Working for a company that really believes in people and the human spirit is uplifting."
good,"You must be good at multi-tasking to work here. Very fast paced and challenging at times. Great benefits and Incredible company to work for. Although it can be stressful at times, it is the best job I have ever had. I would highly recommend this job to anyone."
good,"Very fast paced working environment.  This job sometime can be stressful but very rewarding meeting different types of customers all day.  Entry level, would not recommend staying more than a year."
good,"Working in Starbucks is a good experience,you learn about yourself, about your mates who are students like you. You find really good mates and you learn how it is in big compagnies."
good,Overall this job was good with honestly no complaints. The customers were friendly and workers amazing people. The atmosphere was always upbeat and warm.
good,It's lively but usually a negative attitude from employees. Mostly because of high traffic and rude customers. This could also vary from store to store. But lots of benefits so you can decide if the good outweighs the bad.
good,"Management was good inside the store. Outside the store no one really had an idea of what typically went on so impossible tasks were pushed on employees. Benefits are great, it was fun, changing, hours worked great with school. It was a bummer that the store was never closed. I understand everyone needs coffee, but the employees should also have time to spend with their families during holidays."
good,The Cashier is responsible for handling cash in the registry. Assisting customers finish their purchase politely and courteously. Cashiers are responsible for maintaining the balance of their registry.
good,Starbucks is a fun and fast-paced work environment. The job is what it seems like. The hardest part of the job is managing your time properly to deliver a high quality and consistent product.
good,"Starbucks is always pushing its employees to go above and beyond."
good,"Definitely a hard job to do, but worth it. Usually you think of a barista as just a person who makes your coffee. Believe me when I say there is so much more to it then just making coffee."
good,this was one of the best jobs I've ever had. i grew to be very close with some of my customers.  I had the most amazing boss. The shifts were always fun and light. Management was great from the top to the the bottom.
good,"very busy, learn to manage time well, management could be very tough on you, but definitely manageable. Typical day (night shift) meant a lot of cleaning and less customer interaction"
good,"Every day, new faces, new friends. Fast-paced but fun. Love talking to new customers and helping them get what they need. I learned a lot about myself as a worker there, working at one of the busiest Starbucks in Boston, it can be difficult sometimes but always fun. It's never a dull day at work."
good,"very friendly co coworkers, customers are either ill mannered or friendly of course dependent solely on the person. fast paced environment. pay is good for the work may sometimes be short staffed."
good,The Starbucks in my small town was a relaxed environment with easy going management and easy to learn responsibilities. I made good money as a part time high school worker!
good,"I loved working for Starbucks. I love making drinks old and new and coming up with my own to drink, taste, and share. You get good costumers and real bad costumers but the environment is great. I loved working for Starbucks, It was just my the management at my location was changing and I didn't agree with it so I decided it was my time to leave."
good,"s day at Starbucks starts like any other day "
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work with, but be prepared for a very fast-paced environment. A strong team is necessary. As long as your manager can maintain a schedule and positive attitude within the store, everything will run smoothly."
good,"Starbucks is a fun, fast-paced work environment that allows us to interact with different people everyday. It has taught me the importance to food safety, working under the stress of the morning rush ""peak hour"", as well as provided me with the fundamental knowledge about the coffee world. Starbucks coffee company believes in the idea that each individual cafe should have the atmosphere of a ""third home""- a place for customers and employees to come and enjoy drinks in a friendly environment."
good,"Productive, Fast Paced, Challenging"
good,"I learned a great deal of customer service and respect. A typical day at work is very active and fun at the same time. The hardest part of the job is cleaning, it's a very exciting and cool workplace."
good,The corporation is great and does well to take care of their partners but when it comes to management it can be a hit or miss whether they are good or not.
good,"Fast paced, good benefits as a part time employee.  Good relations.  Customers are difficult at times over a cup of coffee.  Flexible work schedules and ability to switch shifts easily."
good,"super bon travail etudiant ."
good,"Working at Starbucks taught me so many skills and techniques I never thought I'd learn. I learned how to effectively communicate with customers and my coworkers when the work environment would be very busy. I learned recipes of drinks and proper usage of the oven within about 2 weeks and became a certified barista. As a Starbucks barista you would be responsible for either running the register, creating hot and cold drinks to customer specifications, warming up food in the oven, restocking, and cleaning. There would never be a time that there wasn't a task to do. The hardest part of the job was how demanding the customers would be especially when they came in flocks. I loved all of my coworkers because of our personalities and how well we communicated to each other. Management would work with my school schedule and when it was the summer they would give me great hours as well."
good,Hard work but very enjoyable. Very challenging and inspiring work. Always good at looking after its employees and good benefits. The people make this job what is it and makes it one of the best jobs to have.
good,fast and efficient workers . they have wonderful benefits for there employees . they have a customer is always right policy and require all employees to have great customer services .
good,"The store I worked at had the most  loveable, determined, and inspiring  team of partners I have had the pleasure of working with. It was an educational and self growing experience that has taught me a lot. However I felt the running of the store was constantly being tampered with by the heads of the company too often in the attempt of improving the store, however I feel it made it far more difficult. No fault of any members of staff or the manager at my store."
good,"Many opportunity's to advance in the company, benefits were paid all in full. Time off was very generous. Work environment was very inviting. It was like a second home to me. If I lived back in TX I would work there for the rest of my working life."
good,"This job was very fun and easy to balance with my college classes, I will be returning when I return to college. On a basic day I would come clock in and then I would get straight to work."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Starbucks. I loved working, however it became to stressful on my body as I developed an autoimmune disease and could no longer be physically active for as long as required."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing opportunity especially for young people looking to acquire and perfect their team building, time management, and customer interaction skills among many others.  As a barista and then as a shift supervisor I learned more about my capabilities than any other job I have ever worked.  My manager saw leadership capabilities in me that I did not know I had and helped to nurture them and allowed me to perfect them by promoting me to shift supervisor.  A typical day involves making amazing beverages, providing people with a humanizing experience, and lots of cleaning.  The work environment was amazing because the people I worked with were not only excellent team mates but over time became close friends.  I have life long friends from working at Starbucks.  The interactions with the customers and my coworkers was the best part of the job, besides the free coffee.  The hardest part of the job was not drinking to much coffee."
good,"when teamed up with helpful and interesting people, the job can be a home away from home. a few lazy and disrespectful employees can ruin the experience."
good,"As a manager, I would oversee all of the shift requirements and customer service concerns, while managing sales initiatives and protocol. I learned a lot about leadership and managing a team. The management above me was reasonable, yet demanding. The workplace culture was enthusiastic and fun, yet stressful at times. The hardest part of the job was maintaining successful operations. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to interact with the customers on a personal level and develop regular customers."
good,"Balance is great, culture and community events are great opportunities. "
good,The company does a good job portraying opportunity for every employee at every level of Starbucks Coffee. This is not necessarily the reality. Store operations experience is not valued as highly as it should be.
good,Great place to work and connect with customers. It is hard to work a drive thru when hours are cut. It really impacts your store. The benefits and free bean stock is amazing.
good,Starbucks is a surprisingly nice company that tends to look out for the overall comfort of their employees. I had been a barista before and the pace and specifications of drinks at Starbucks was a challenge but I felt supported during the learning process and genuinely enjoyed the store in which I worked.
good,Worked closing shifts. Very busy learned how to make many coffee drinks and work together with a team. The management at the store had some ups and downs our store manager had quit in the middle of her shift early when I first started working there and had many different store managers come in to fill in for the absence of our store. The hardest part of the job was working short staffed most of the time as we were understaffed as a store. The most enjoyable part of working there was the coworkers were very nice and very helpful teaching whenever I needed an help.
good,"For the most part, this job is very easy and straightforward. The biggest issue I had mostly dealt with the occasional times where not many people were willing to come in when they weren't scheduled to. I feel like I really learned how to deal with the stress  that comes from a particularly busy day, and I definitely learned how to rely on and work with a coworker in a way that benefits everyone. I honestly think that I would not have been able to stay with the company for so long if it weren't for my coworkers. I worked at two different locations and sometimes worked at another store, and the Starbucks crew was always very friendly and like a little Starbucks family."
good,Really busy store that teaches you how to work under so much pressure. The most enjoyable part of the job is the times you get to know and chat with the customers and also learn so many different things about lots of different cultures.
good,serve customers with their daily needs. We sniff different types of coffee and give out samples to customers. We make them feel welcome and make their drinks exactly as they ordered.
good,Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. They have fair management and great benefits. I also enjoy the perks that they offer through ASU and Spotify.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. The people are always nice and the benefits are a huge plus. I always look forward to heading to work because no day is the same.
good,Country kitchen was my second job. It was great. A great crew. I've never worked in another restu raunt where every one gets along. Blockbuster was much the same
good,"I loved Starbucks. The customers and the management made this a great place to work. Challenges and opportunities were great. I loved being kept busy and feeling valued. I enjoy great, quick conversations with people however this job is not for everyone, you need to be very active and interpersonal skills are a must!"
good,"a typical working day in Starbucks is fun. There's never a dull moment when I am at duty. Colleagues and even customers are very friendly. We, baristas are taught how to satisfy each and every customer and never let them leave the store unsatisfied. We are also always motivated by the management team to do our best in everything we do and always do it with integrity. The hardest part of the job for me is when we need to transfer to another store. New colleagues, customers and environment but eventually they will be your new family."
good,I liked my time working for starbucks. They are a great company to work for that offer amazing benefits to their employees. Theres always room to advance and move up in the company. There training is great.
good,A typical day is very busy and you often have to switch positions throughout the day or cover two stations due to short staff.  There are no benefits unless you are full time.
good,it's a really good place to work if you love coffee i mean it is starbucks it has good benefits and you get to have free lunches and get a markout a week (one bag of coffee a week)
good,"Working for Starbucks has been a very useful thing for me. Flexible hours helped create the perfect environment for a student, and the light-hearted staff became some of my closest friends. However, money earned was minimum wage or barely above. This is not enough to live on at full-time employment. Advancement in the company is gated to associate management at the most. Additionally, workers are expected to be on their feet for their entire shift, minus brief 10 minute breaks. The physical toll is notable. In summary, this is the perfect job for a student working through school. It is not a job you should intend to stay at for longer than that."
good,"I'd say that working for Starbucks is definitely something one must commit to for the sake of making it through. Career advancement while possible is highly dependent on factors outside of work ability (e.g. friendships, day-part worked, and nepotism). However still a good job for students or those looking for part-time work to fill time or reap healthcare benefits."
good,On a typical day at work I make about 250-300 drinks. I learned how to manage my time more efficiently by following routines that ensure quick and correct work is being done. It is a fun workplace culture with very little downtime. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing how delighted customers get when you make a connection with them.
good,"I enjoyed my time working as a Barista at Starbucks for many reasons, most notably because of my colleagues as well as the customers. The work was very interesting and stimulating, with a wide diversity of tasks."
good,"I have fun everyday when I come in to work, the work pace is steady & flexible but  my co work has no problem assisting if I need help,"
good,These companies offer good healthcare and there is room to move up. The management for the store I worked for was very professional. I would recommend working for either company
good,"Good Job for College students looking for flexiblity, teaches one how to work and build customer relationship on a daily basis. "
good,a pleasure working here. i always had a love for coffee. learned new ways to make expresso. taste a whole lot of different coffees. made friends. a community type feel.
good,"Cashier, prepare beverages, clean lobby and work area, overseeing daily operations, assisted with restocking product, and night closures. Fast pace and fun job."
good,"En una tienda se siente un gran ambiente de trabajo, además que el trabajo no es pesado y te diviertes al hacerlo"
good,You have the opportunity to work with great people in a fun environment. Management is extremely supportive and flexible with your schedule. There's a great work/life balance.
good,"I've worked at Starbucks for 5 years and it was my first work on a customer service environment. Starbucks built my self confidence and helped me a lot in understanding how it should be as a management in leading people and handling the business itself. We undergo certain seminars and attend some classes to achieved a better view on being an assistant store manager. The hardest part of the job though was meeting the sales target every month. During my stay in Starbucks, I've met and teaches different people whom now are also part of the management team."
good,Fun days making coffee and serving pastries with a great crew. Hardest part of the job would be getting up for the 4am shift. Best part of the job was the free coffee drinks you could get while on the clock.
good,Liked meeting new people and learning new skills.  Meet and work with new people constantly. Change is always occurring and you learn something new every day.
good,"Fast paced and stressful place to work,  overall I loved ut, but I don't make enough money here. The manager is very nice though. The discounts and benefits are also very good."
good,"Starbucks is a friendly, fast paced, challenging, and highly competitive job. Management is very hands on and there is always something new to learn with the change of the seasons. The best part of the job are my customers and my fellow baristas, they make it worth it all. The hardest part of the job is when there is not enough coverage for the rushes of people that come through certain days, which does not happen all the time, but when it does, it can feel stressful. The customers and my fellow team mates are very caring and patient and make the stress seem to fade away with each interaction. I enjoy the culture Starbucks brings and how close we are, I feel like Starbucks is a second home."
good,"I usually had worked mornings. They were always busy and time went by fast. I had a great work family and loved working with everyone. Everyone gets to do different sorts of jobs everyday, and you get to stretch your creative mind."
good,"Going into work is a joy.  I wish Starbucks would take more pride into thier upper management and do the 360 evaluation. It is awesome that you can see your schedule online, but I wish you could make changes to it, and request times off - more computer interaction, maybe one day."
good,"I'd recommend this company to a friend - but warn against the salary at the corp level. It's not competitive."
good,My time with Starbucks has been very enjoyable. I truly enjoy my partners and have formed many relationships with customers. I work part time ( 3 days ) a week. I have taken advantage of my stock & am so appreciative that they give it to you; just for working there. My health benefits were alright; it does depend on the plan you choose; but affordable. As I have worked there over 10 years; I am a partner for life; which means 30% off and a lb. of coffee for life.  It is a fast paced environment and hard work & I like my job.
good,"Starbucks is great, friendly staff, friendly customers and most importantly coffee! desirable hours, able to switch shifts with ease. I think I'll try to keep this as a side job as long as i can while continuing through life with other jobs"
good,"The job can be fast paced and fun, it can also be stressful and repetitive. I think it's interesting how everyone has a specific way they like their coffee. If you enjoy making handcrafted beverages, elegant coffees and  sweet Frappuccino's, than this is the job for you!"
good,They are very considerate especially since i was a student when I became a partner.  I would definitely recommend working in starbucks because they give attractive employee benefits
good,When you walk in Starbucks you should feel loved and that's what I feel when I work. It is a good chance to work with awesome people and have a good experience with customers.
good,Starbucks was one of the best team building jobs I've found. They do a good job of the aching their employees how to utilize their time in the most efficient way possible.
good,great company supportive environment I enjoy working there perfect job for college and high school students can be stressful at times sometimes customers are not the best people
good,It's difficult to learn the all the material but once you do everything is quite easy. It's very easy to be yourself at work which is also pretty cool.
good,"For how much Starbucks makes a year, and how much they say they do for their partners. I think they could do more. Living wages will help keep long term partners. Fast paced, customer focused, stressful."
good,"To keep this short and sweet, the biggest reason I left Starbucks is because I was offered another job that was going to pay me more. All and all they're a great company to work for, the benefits are decent, and they offer their employees a lot of perks."
good,"Always learning something new. Never a boring day. Was an enjoyable place to work, with great opportunity to grow. Can't beat the scenery of the beautiful Carson Valley, located just east of Lake Tahoe."
good,"Starbucks is Productive & Fun work place,you learned a lot of things especially about different kinds of beans ang a growing regions,Starbucks  a place of keep on learning."
good,Reasonable hours and never given over time or made to stay longer than my shift required. Excellent product with the opportunity to enjoy a free beverage while working. A lot of perks and benefits provided by employer.
good,"everyday is a fast and full of people. everyday was full of moving as fast as you can and sometimes that isn't enough, just when you think you are doing ok, your doing worst. luckily I was able to bounce around to different stores."
good,"Meet awesome people and there are great benefits to working with this company like bean stock, free drinks on shift, staff discounts, free coffee every week and even part time employees are eligible for health benefits."
good,Fast Paced and Lots of room for growth. Management promotes from within and gives the training you need to succeed. Opportunity for Tuition Reimbursement and TIPS for hours worked.
good,A typical day begins with clocking in stocking up whatever it is that seems to be running low. What I've learned is there is a lot of key elements you have to learn while working at a Starbucks.Overall  the best part of the job is connecting with the customers and and my coworkers.
good,Work was always fun but at times could be difficult due to the fast paced nature of the job environment. I learned that making connections with coworkers makes work a lot more enjoyable. Management was alright. Everyone was very humorous and always were down to have fun on the job while still performing duties. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with business. The best part of my job was having incredible coworkers.
good,"helped acquire fast paced work experience. Coworkers were friendly and helpful. Took safety very seriously. Gained skills of packaging, stacking, use of a pallet jacks and advanced bar code scanners."
good,Very diverse and fast paced............good coffee............nice specials.........some what clean..... hospitality needs improvements.....pay needs improvements
good,"I really appreciated the support I received at Starbucks as a returning college student.  They totally worked with me on my crazy schedule.  I loved that there was an early morning option, where I could work a 4-5 hr. shift before I went to school.  I was divorced 6 years ago, so it was vital that I could provide medical/dental insurance for my kids.  I couldn't believe that I could work part-time, go to school and provide that insurance for my family.  I loved my co-workers, too.  They were very positive and fun to work with.  Starbucks is awesome."
good,"get there, put apron on ,start work take a 10 minute break after 2 hours.  Be on time back from break and go back to work.  Good for High School & College kids"
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks.  Everyone was like one big family to me.  The best part of my job was helping coworkers and customers during my shift.
good,"Fun place to work with fun people. Clientele is fairly particular but usually very friendly!"
good,"It was a great place to work, since I just relocated to Madison, WI. I loved the customers, and creating hand crafted beverages. Overall great environment."
good,"Free college with ASU online! Flexible schedules and usually fun co-workers. Early mornings can be rough, but you get used to it. I don't drink coffee, but you also get free drinks."
good,"good place to work. "
good,Starbucks is a great place to work! The customers are always happy to see you for their cup of coffee. The job culture was great. Employees are happy to be at work and you only have to work a minimum of 20 hours to receive benefits.
good,I had a good time there at Starbucks. It was fast paced and ever changing. Great support from corporate and a great team environment. I would definitely work there again
good,"stable, friendly, open to change, easy going, clean, costumer satisfaction ,fun, understanding, fast, creative, a league of its own, drinks are awesome"
good,"Great company to work for if you're looking to be promoted within.  I really love working with teams, and taking charge, and Starbucks has truly been great to me."
good,"fun place to work, great environment, good pay plus great benefits, many opportunities for advancement, fast-paced, customer service oriented, big on standards"
good,Typical day at work allows me to experience and balance out my Shift Supervisor duties as a friend and boss for my cowokers. It gives me the ability to have a healthy balance in between that. Having a healthy balanced relationship with your team gives you the ability to work in a great environment with benefits like Starbucks.I have to face challenges every single day with cowokers disagreeing or customers that aren't happy and I have to solve all those issues because that's my job.
good,The managers could have done a better job to maintain politeness and proper communication among employees (I noticed a lot of gossip by lower and upper level employees). Found that to be very unprofessional.
good,"Mornings can be pretty tough with peak rush, but overall the days go by so fast that you'll forget about any tough customers or if you spill a drink, a partner will immediately come and help out. Coworkers are amazing and have great personalities. We always prioritize customers and making sure that they leave Starbucks wit a smile on their face is always a main goal. You get personal with the people that come in, you learn their names, their drinks, where they work, you might even meet their family. Work place can be fun on slow days because you get the chance to connect with your coworkers."
good,I learned a lot at Starbucks and gained a lot of experience of different levels of customer service. I learned a lot about coffee culture. I met some great people and gained friends along the way.
good,"Result driven and hand-on manager."
good,"I started working for Starbucks in high school and I worked on and off through college during my down time. It was a great entry level job and I learned a lot of very important skills during my time with the company. The hours are flexible and it is a very fun work environment. I personally never took advantage of the benefits, but I knew several of my coworkers were there for the benefit package alone."
good,work was fun and fast paced at times i learned bar routine and how to make differant types of coffess the hardest part of the job was learning bar routine and the most enjoyable was getting up and close to the customers
good,"Management and co-workers are great, with the typical pros and cons of working any other customer service position. Benefits are fantastic for a part time job."
good,My work day would usually start with me and a fellow coworker stocking the store.The hardest part about my job would be stocking the store alone when my coworker is late or is not there.
good,My co-workers were nice and helped me out when I first started my work experience. The hardest part about the job was how fast paced the environment was at Starbucks. I learned how to sample and provide customers with those samples and restocked items when needed.
good,"Trained to work bar, customer support, and register. Very fulfilling job over all, decent pay, safe and comfortable environment. Typical duties of a green bean barista include cleaning the back room, bar, restrooms and floor, making drinks on bar and off bar, and being proactive and taking initiative to comfort and satisfy the store volume of customers."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for nearly nine years. I must say, it is a great company to work for. Especially for benefits. You only have to work part time to get them. keep it up SBUX!"
good,A typical day at Starbucks consisted of prep due to the large volume of customers we would receive during the rushing periods. What I learned is once one person it not on top of their game the whole team gets thrown off. Management was good. They were a little bit too tough but they were always fair and never let the team fall. The workplace culture was the best part because the teammates would actually set up out of work parties so we would be able to get to know each other a little bit more. The hardest part of the job was the morning rushing period due to the extremely high volume of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the liveliness of the work environment.
good,It is a fast paced environment. You have to be able to learn fast and retain a lot of information. The hardest part of the job is knowing all of the drinks and routines. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers (most of them). They really make your day and in return you make their day. The best part of the job is the friends you make. They become your friends for life.
good,"Great Place to work, awesome staff, and good coffee. Starbucks takes care of their baristas. It's a great environment to gain customer service and retail knowledge."
good,"Striving to create the ""third place"" for customers everyday is my goal. Training new partners to have the same goals.  Building relationships that last years with customers is the best part of my day."
good,"Great time"
good,"星巴克是全世界最大的咖啡品牌，來自美國的咖啡文化，可以為香港帶來一種活力。"
good,"i loved the customers and coworkers i worked with "
good,"a typical work palce is very fashion followed"
good,"The work environment is clean, efficient, and comfortable. I love the perks: partner benefits, free coffee and food. The managers are usually pretty flexible with your work schedule and nice to work with."
good,Great atmosphere with great company culture. A typical day at work revolves around making the customer experience right as well as offering high quality customer service and beverages.
good,"was a great experience to learn how to deal with large amounts of people at any given time to place the orders and execute them. Learned the responsibilities of managing several people, their breaks, inventory, etc"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work not only are the customers understanding, the co workers and management are very friendly work together as a team. I will work at Starbucks again."
good,"Buena empresa labora,Con demasiado publicó amable."
good,"Fast-paced position - prepares aspiring bartender through the constant making of multiple drinks in a quick-paced environment.  Everything about it creates a positive environment. Management is well trained, and cares about other employees."
good,"Perfect job for the in/under-experienced 18-22 year-old and/or part-time college student. Since Starbucks takes such a staunch interest investing in their employees, great benefits are available. It's fast-paced and it's easy to get overlooked, but there is room to grow. They have high standards regarding customer service, cleanliness, routine, and knowledge with often inadequate training."
good,it's a lot paying job with good benefits and the people are great. Sell coffee to customers talk about existing and future products. It's extremely hard to move up in Starbucks because a position needs to be opened prior which rarely happens. The job is great for anyone from the ages of 18 to 30.
good,I got a good customer service experience from Starbucks.How to greet customer and how to make them happy with our great customer service these all I studied from there.we are getting a nice working experience from our company.
good,"I loved working here because I never got bored. There was always something that needed to be done, so the day went by really fast. It was fun learning how to make all of the espresso beverages, and coworkers were kind and fun to be around."
good,"-loved this company and returned several times"
good,"Good working atmosphere"
good,"Come to work, customers flock in, so happy to see you! Learn the art of creating handcrafted custom beverages. Learn latte art. Make friends that will last a lifetime. Work for a company that gives you blocks of time to go volunteer with various organizations of your choice (I did local schools and animal shelters). Learn marketing strategies, and host Starbucks events. The sky is literally the limit working for Starbucks. Wonderful benefits packages and a free pound of coffee or a box of Tazo teas every week. The only job I have ever had that I cried like a baby when I moved and had to quit."
good,"Muy buena experiencia, en el servicio al cliente y disponiéndome de hacer todo con una sonrisa."
good,"Loved the opportunity to be able to work as Store Manager and the responsibility given."
good,Starbucks is a great corporation to work for if you are looking for a job to pass by the time while in college. It is very difficult to make a career out of Starbucks.
good,Definitely a fast paced enviornment that is fun to work in. Its good to know that your helping someone start their morning off perfect with a great cup of coffee and maybe a pastry.
good,"可以學到有關專業服務業該有的技能"
good,Starbucks was a great place to work . I wish I would of stayed but unfortunately my hours sucked at the time & I needed a better income .
good,"You meet many people from all walks of life. I loved the environment at starbucks, even though I am not a parter anymore I will forever be a customer."
good,"A typical day at starbucks is always busy, so it keeps you alert and on your feet. The job helps you manage your time, helps with people skills, and also teaches you how to handle money accordingly. At starbucks I learned about myself, the company, and how to always make things better. Management is really good especially if you are new, but as you becoming a senior barista, management slacks on keeping up with you just because you know what to do already. The workplace environment is the best, the music, the people, your fellow partners, it is just wonderful and always has you smiling. Hardest part of the job is just making the drinks, especially when it is rush hour. Most enjoyable part of the job is handing off the customers drink and putting a smile on their face as they take a sip of the delicious beverage."
good,"I've learned a lot from this company "
good,"Able to meet and interact with different people."
good,"A typical day involves greeting customers and meeting company standards in terms of customer service and preparing orders at bar. I learned the wants and needs of a typical customer in a fast paced food/beverage retail store."
good,"A typical day at work is usually accompanied by a couple angry customers or maybe just someone who didn't like their drink, but it's OK. Everyone around you really makes the experience better. Some customers have the best day just because you remember their order or gave them a free item, it's just a matter of how you present yourself."
good,"Couldn't handle this long term, but the people were great and the job itself was the issue, rather than the company. Starbucks tries really hard to make its employees happy, but there are angry customers at any business."
good,Just covered when they were busy. It was fun for the short time I did it. It wasn't anything stressful. When Starbucks got busy they asked for back up. So I would ring up drinks and make the simple ones to help shorten up the line.
good,"This was my first official job, this actually helped me with my social awareness and learned to understand how to really work as a team and lead them. I enjoyed making the drinks for the customers and my co-workers having fun at the same time. I recommend this as a entry job to lead to more opportunities."
good,"great job to meet new friends and people but the do low pay and less shift. the benefit packs are great so yeah"
good,"This is a great company with an awesome work environment. Pay is not great until assistant manager level, at which point it becomes fairly competitive with the retail market. biggest obstacle is focusing on a long term career that actually gives you advancement."
good,"Lots of routines; cleaning tasks (day part and nighttime)."
good,I love working for Starbucks and making connections on a daily basis. I like seeing the business grow and how my leadership inspires others.
good,"From the perspective of partner-customer relations, Starbucks is great at fostering a guest welcoming atmosphere and making great drinks. One cup at a time."
good,It was very fun working for a major company that valued its employees and customers deeply. I was also able to open up more to customer service.
good,"GREAT team work, fun, customer involved, appropriate breaks, casual, flexible about hours and schedules, works well if you need time off due to an emergency, energetic environment"
good,"Starbucks works its employees as hard as it possibly can, so it can pay as few people as possible to do an enormous amount of work. Each employee is regularly expected to do the work of at least 2-3 people, and still provide exceptional customer service. But its not possible to provide that when your employer regularly cuts hours and leaves its employees with a skeleton crew in order to save a little extra money. The customer experience should be Starbucks' first priority, and while they claim that to be the case, it's not. The truth is Starbucks' first priority is profit, and everything else, including employee morale and customer satisfaction, is a distant second."
good,Starbucks is a very good company to work for. They have excellent benefits for employees no matter your position.If your're a good worker it's not hard to move up
good,"Great job for friendly, service oriented people. Definitely not for everyone. It takes a solid 3 months to get comfortable with all the drink recipes. Management varies from store to store. My manager  is great and really flexible with my scheduling needs. Hourly positions are eligible for benefits if you work 20+hours/week."
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic company to work for, and excels in providing work/life balance!"
good,"This job is a fairly enjoyable for the most part. There are always going to be customers that can ruin your day, but there will also be those that make it great. The job itself isn't challenging but it's always fast paced."
good,"Starbucks was a lovely place to work, I left because of the crooked management and the team leads who did nothing but criticize and lie about my work to my manager."
good,In all honesty Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. It gives great benefits and really cares about its employees and the impact it places on the world around it. It's really amazing. But your experience can vary store to store depending on the attitudes and relations between you and your fellow coworkers and the customers. But you make those experience yourself.
good,Great environment with fun work and wonderful customers as well as benefits....but the hours are terrible which  means the pay is terrible. Great part time job for college students or anyone looking to pick up extra cash.
good,"Very easy to move up in the ranks, from barista to shift supervisor. As a student, the weekly free pound of beans and Spotify Premium are great perks. Only have to work an average of 24 hours a week for medical benefits."
good,Starbucks is a sweet place to work. Being in the Chinook mall is awesome for many reasons. Everyone I worked with was like family and we all had great times together!
good,"Loved working here. A lot of my good friends are people I met when I worked at Starbucks. I enjoyed making drinks and meeting new people everyday. The connections I made in that job, just through the people I served, can't compare to anywhere else that I worked."
good,"The retail environment is a difficult place to compete while still doing right by employees, but the fact that so many people stick with the company (or come back to the company periodically, as in my case) shows that Starbucks really puts effort into it."
good,"Great place to work in my earlier years, great benefits wonderful coworkers. Had bad experience with management in the end, forcing me to find other work more related to my desired field, but held me interest and dedication for long enough."
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks because i worked with interesting people and the regulars were awesome! I gained lots of knowledge on coffee and enjoyed getting crafty with my own twists. Perfect spot to work if you are in school or just want a part time job so you're not bored.
good,"I loved it at starbucks its so cool you you in an warm environment the whole time ,so little to no attitudes or arguments or bad vibes. You very rely had a day were you came and left with the same attitude or problem on your mind."
good,"Great Managers!! Great Co-workers!! And Great customers."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, I just wished management  had a little bit more compassion when it comes to making the schedule so that all the baristas have an equal amount of hours."
good,"Starbucks stores are a deceptively high paced environment, in which there are a large amount of tasks to be accomplished and goals to be reached while maintaining the highest level of customer service possible. At Starbucks, the customer always comes first and second. The benefits are exceptional, especially when considered along the relatively minuscule requirements to receive them. Depending on store location though it can be rather difficult to advance within the company, for a variety of reasons including low turnover rates in store leadership teams, and overall sales of the store. This job depending upon your needs can be absolutely fantastic, especially if one is working through college, but it also may not satisfy certain needs. It is quite important to be thoroughly aware of the full scope of becoming a barista before committing."
good,"Great place to meet people and learn different kinds of coffee. Fast pace environment, so you really need to be on your toes. But when you work with a great Team, it makes it a lot easier."
good,"Everything is great except the pay, which is unsurprisingly low. Benefits at 20 hours per week. The company lost its ""inclusive and inviting"" culture years ago, and morale has certainly gone down, but it's still better than most jobs in this industry."
good,"Basically you clean more than you make drinks and serve customers.  The rush hour is sure to get your adrenaline going with 80 customers coming through the door every hour! Management is always positive, striving to boost productivity and encourage advancement within the company. Being part of a fun, energetic team and creating relationships with regular customers makes everyday unique."
good,Working with Starbucks was a great experience. The company helped me grow as an individual but also within the company.
good,"Un trabajo que se amoldaba con mi forma de ser. Ambiente comodo para trabajar y todos permaneciamos activos. Nuestra característica era la conexión que teniamos con cada uno de nuestros clientes hasta llegar hacerlos sentir como si fuera su tercer lugar en el cual podian ir a trabajar, reunirse o simplemente relajarse."
good,"was preparing all the store to be ready for customers before opening time at 6 am , starting from preparing all coffees , teas , cold drinks in the display unit"
good,"Learned how to remain calm under pressure and how to work smoothly with a team in highly busy situations."
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced place to work, but you must be willing to be busy every second of the job, making drinks or taking orders from customers.  Management is good and people are fun to work with."
good,This was my college part-time job and it was very rewarding.  I learned a lot about customer service and providing a great product while working in a team environment.  My day would usually be split between working the espresso bar and cashier.  I worked several different Starbucks stores throughout my life and enjoyed each and every one.
good,Working at Starbucks was a great learning experience within the coffee world. The variety of culture among the employees is a plus. Building relationships with customers is a must and thus a great personality builder. Fun job.
good,Working at Starbucks is easy once you have completed trying and have hands on experience. The people you work with will make the work and time pass by quicker. It is what you may of it and you get to meet a lot of nice people while working there.
good,"I loved working for Starbucks as a brand and my coworkers were amazing but the management was unsteady and created a somewhat unpleasant work environment. Each day as a barista, I took orders from both the drive thru and within the store. I prepared these drinks and also went about cleaning duties and drink preparation throughout my shift. As a shift supervisor, I ran shifts which included inventory counts and cash handling. My coworkers were amazing and are still some of my greatest friends. My manager unfortunately over scheduled me while I was still in school and did not give me proper guidance so I had to leave the company to focus on my grades more and find a more flexible schedule. The hardest part of the job was taking responsibility for mistakes one of my baristas had made and dealing with customers to fix them. The thing I enjoyed the most about this job was the people that worked there and the regular customers that were like family. Being there I learned the ins and outs of coffee and customer service."
good,"Over the four years I have worked at starbucks, I can say that I've enjoyed working with 95% of the staff and customers.My typical day of work consists of serving customers and the day/closing cleaning tasks."
good,Very busy and fun place to work. Lots of hands on experience and challenging between juggling duties and management. Love the human interaction it offers. Hardest part of job is managing employees while maintaining a professional relationship with them. Most enjoyable part is the human connection :)
good,"A typical day at work would involve serving copious amounts of friendly customers. I discovered how to effectively serve customers while maintaining a friendly demeanor; furthermore I learned how to multitask as well as serve/make various specialty drinks. The management was mildly acceptable, with room for improvement. The coworkers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was learning how to work in a fast paced environment at first, yet it was easy to overcome with practice. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers."
good,"Starbucks has a great culture and mission.  I learned making lattés can be fun. Management is young, up and coming. Great first time or part-time job."
good,At Starbucks I was a shift supervisor responsible for ordering products and making sure my coworkers and customers were happy.
good,"Working at Starbucks made me realize that even a small gesture can go a long way. On a typical day, the partners and customers are both very easy going, and the managers are very organized as well. The hardest part about working at Starbucks at my location specifically, is when it becomes very busy and we are low on staff. But over all because everyone is very easy going, it was very enjoyable working for Starbucks."
good,"Skills such as multi-tasking, being able to work in a fast paced environment and adapt to a tough but fair management approach.  Typical day involved taking multiple drink orders at the same time, stocking necessities, and able to keep up with an intensely fast working environment.  Co-workers are very nice and helpful, as long as you do your job well, work fast and hard.  The hardest part of the job was also the most enjoyable for myself.  If was the pace of the workday.  Very challenging, if it were not for the effectiveness of my fellow employees being able to work at a fast paced level, helped the most during everyday work-related activities."
good,"Great job  awesome place to work  fun  environment           And busy work place "
good,"Being a part-time barista that has to complete 20 hours in a week can sometimes be more tiring as some stores lack in manpower and would need you to come and cover shifts."
good,"I love working here, great company. I haven't worked here long and I don't really want to write a review. this is a ridiculous requirement for me to find a new job."
good,I liked that it was always busy in the store so there was always something to do. Jobs where you stand around and don't do much I don't enjoy. Getting to know the customers was great because you get that personal interaction going and get to know them a bit.
good,I love working with the residents. They made it very fun. It taught me the different types of diets and helped me to get closer with the residents to accommodate their specific needs
good,management was the only reason I stayed with the company for so long. Had it not been for management I would have left the company as soon as I got on with another job. There is some dark needy customers to deal with. And also the atmosphere of working there has a lot of coworkers that will talk behind your back and make stories up to see them
good,i worked at a very busy store so things got somewhat hectic at times but they were very good at placing people where they should be top keep the line moving.
good,Starbucks is a fun job to have. It's all about quality & customer satisfaction. You get to learn about the origins of coffee blends and pass on the knowledge to others. You get to meet people in all walks of life.
good,"Flexible work schedule for those in college, or looking to earn extra cash as a part time job. Coworkers are friendly, meet nice people."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for many reasons -- you really feel like you're part of a team, you get great benefits, you learn a lot of customer service skills."
good,being a barista is an enjoyable job for me because of you can make a customers day by giving what we call a legendary service making a cup of coffee each day doing the daily tasks that was assigned to you
good,The staff was great to work with. made great memories with co-workers and costumers. the management could have been better. but over all great place to work at.
good,"Great benefits, good work environment, adequate compensation."
good,Starbucks is an enjoyable place to work. the fast paced environment helps the shift to go by fast. creating a place where people like to come and know they will leave happy is what its all about
good,An awesome work environment for those interested in learning how to work inside of a fast paced cafe setting. Very involving and straneous.
good,"its always a busy a day in Starbucks From the time you come in and start your busy but happy day. I started in Starbucks who doesn't know anything about coffee or even how to use a dish washing machine. But since I have a good partners working beside slow but surely I become a passionate barista. Then I become a Supervisor. The hardest part is when I get transfer in a new store. As a Supervisor knowing your team inside and out is the hardest part not only their strength but also their possibilities. Their attitude and behavior. The most enjoyable part is when you see the people around you feeling happy working with you. Happy customers, having a third place for our customers. I learned all about coffee its good experience. They smell of fresh brewed coffee always makes my day."
good,Really enjoyed my time at this location. Employees were very professional and took pride in their work. Customers were all regulars that could brighten up your day.
good,"Starbucks is a fast paced and lively environment. It can be stressful at times with so many things going on, but for someone who likes coffee, it is fantastic. My coworkers were friendly and helpful in the learning process. I throughly enjoyed being able to make recommendations on drinks, making the drinks and interacting with regular customers."
good,"While  I was with Starbucks it was a lot of fun.  Its a repetive job but its also fun.  The wages could be better, great company."
good,Working at star bucks' was a lot of fun and free coffee with many opportunities and flexible schedules. Wet coffee grains are a bit heavy duty but I guess that's why theirs always men on the floor (lol)
good,Happy to work with Starbucks   It's such a nice place to learn about coffee and standar. The most enjoyable part is team work. Will enjoy it
good,"-meet a lot of interesting co-workers as well as customers"
good,"This job is simply put amazing. The staff and management are all very helpful. You will find this to be a family type of group where we all look out for each other."
good,"Greatly enjoyed the work I did while working for this company. Had great interactions with repeat customers during every shift, as well as new customers on their first visit to the store. Management at this location was very agreeable ad easy to get along with. Did have some issues with select student employees and often had difficulties arriving to work on time due to bus scheduling and a lack of nearby parking spaces to allow me to drive to work. Otherwise, this was a fantastic job that I am disappointed to move on from."
good,its a very fast paced and demanding job in a small space. I was tying to get out of food service and I got offered a better job so I ended up leaving.
good,"Starbucks is a massive corporation that tries to feel like a small business to its customers. It ends up in a limbo; the regulars definitely give the store a local, cozy feel. Many of the baristas are excited about their job and try very hard to make Starbucks the company it wants to be."
good,"Work was always fast pace and fun. It made the day go by fast never felt like I worked the amount of hours I would work. It was a store by two schools, so was really busy before school, lunch time and when school got out."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral."
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, it can be a bit stressful but overall it is a great company to work for. You get really good benefits such as insurance, free coffee, and profit sharing."
good,"Although not for everyone, the fast pace environment makes me such a proud partner of the company. The advantages to working there make it so great. I truly love it."
good,"A friendly environment with lot of space for growth and amazing team."
good,"Starbucks has create training structure.  Sets you for success and continuously check on you for any help you need."
good,"the typical day working at starbucks was, in one word, fun! i learned quite a lot of things such as; time management and leadership. The management were amazing and my co-workers were some of nicest people i've ever met. The hardest part about the job was that it was extremely hard to maintain while still being in school, if i could have done both i would. in general though, Starbucks was an amazing experience for me and would surely be the same for anyone else!"
good,I loved working for the company and interacting with so many different people every day. Though I do it is time to expand my horizon and step up into the working field.
good,Nice place to work love learning coffee love the smells .Meet all type of people. Hardworking staff. It's good that there are so many and now some have wine
good,Very flexible and team-oriented workplace. Supervisors and managers were very focused on employees well being happiness. Plenty of advancement opportunities.
good,"I'm lucky enough to have a great manager who is very organized and works to meet the needs of all of her employees. I work in a very fast paced store and some days it's overwhelming but most days the flow is nice. Starbucks offers a lot of nice benefits; you get ftee Spotify premium, you can go to Arizona State University for free for your first degree, you can get yearly benefits, and so on."
good,It is a busy coffee shop where you get an opportunity to interact with different types of people. The teamwork is amazing between management and baristas. The hardest part of the job is having an inconsistent work schedule but it helps you learn how to find a balance between work life and family life.
good,"Is so easy work in there, and become some one, just need work with mind.the problem is the moning shift 5:30 Am."
good,"In starbucks every day is a busy day from the morning till the sun is out. "
good,"My coworkers were my favorite part about my job with Starbucks. We were encouraged to be friendly with one another and to build relationships with the people who worked alongside us. The benefits the company offered ALMOST outweighed the less-than-desirable downsides of the job. I honestly do not feel like I was compensated nearly enough, considering upper management's extremely high, and often out of reach, expectations. The labor cuts we faced in recent months really hurt us, and definitely stretched some of us very thin! However, the environment of my store was always pretty positive, and I made friends with a lot of my customers, in addition to the inevitable friendships with my coworkers! The hardest part of the job was definitely the customer service aspect; however, if you go into the job knowing that customer service is the biggest part of it, it's not so bad after awhile. My General Manager was wonderful; she did everything she could to accommodate everyone's individual schedules, and she worked harder on the floor then anyone else! I definitely feel I have learned many things; I have had tons of experience working with multiple people at one time, with multiple people under stressful situations, how to organize a floor plan that runs smoothly and efficiently, and keeping calm under pressure. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Starbucks, and am sad to leave my coworkers behind. However, I definitely look forward to the next step and chapter of my life! I wouldn't be who I am today without them, and I am forever thankful for that."
good,"I worked in this busy café as a counter assistant and I had a lot of duties which includes managing the till, taking orders, handling cash, making coffee and with this I worked in the deli section which improved my ability to prepare food in very short time and I had to make sure that everything is neat and clean along with managing the stock in an order."
good,Excellent place to work. They take care of their employees. A very fast paced work environment where teamwork and communication are a must. It has taught me a lot of valuable skills.
good,"I did fall in love as a barista"
good,"A typical day at work was sporadic in rushes of customers, constant in maintenance of cleanliness, and fun with my coworkers. The hardest part would be when there is no space in between taking care of the customer and keeping order in the back and of our immediate space. I did enjoy my job over all, especially because I worked with efficient and consistent partners who, we all kept our worker moral up with the help of the management that passed through us all."
good,"As a barista- It was difficult to learn the drink recipes at first but one you get the basics of them, everything else just builds off it and it is really very easy!"
good,"I received great benefits.. health and dental insurance, as well as stocks and 401k options. Hours varied and there isn't much room for advancement. Overall I enjoyed my job."
good,"Travail plutôt agréable, expérience enrichissante avec des relations client et vente restauration."
good,"Working any customer service job has it's high and low points. The thing that gets you through the work day is the team of partners you have working alongside you. Hardest part of the job is learning to see what needs to be done, maintaining store without prompts. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet."
good,Fast paced and fun work environment with flexible hours and great coworkers. Everyone should experience the barista life at least once in their life.
good,"Really cool co workers, if you need a shift covered just post it on the company Facebook page and all Starbucks partners in Tucson can see it."
good,"Long Days, Pay Can be Better. Love the customers and making those close relationships with them to ensure that they return to your store."
good,"Working at starbucks taught me how to be a better person, a more loving person, and how to deal with so many different personalities."
good,"The job in itself was great, I admired the algorithmic system, in which things got done at an efficient rate. However my only issue was being under sub par management so the cadence system that is Starbucks was thrown out of wack, making the stores structure not so sturdy, which was reflected through our demographics."
good,I enjoy working at Starbucks. The baristas were very fun and easy to work with and the job duties were easy to grasp and i was able to learn quickly and work my way up to being a shift supervisor.
good,"Lots of rushes through out the day. My patience level has gone up tremendously since working there. The manager was a very nice and very strict. Co workers we're nice or indifferent or flat out rude to me personally. Hardest part of the job was training. Its such a fast paced environment, most trainees will feel like they're not learning anything till after about a month. The most enjoyable part of the job was the personal connection with the customers."
good,Always have to work hard and communicate with other employees. At Starbucks the employee is required to satisfy the customer and always have information on the store available for others knowledge.
good,very nice experience working in star bucks and it also joiined with a tatqa groups in india  i abroad there will be more response for starbucks
good,"Almost everyone I met at Starbucks has been awesome. Management tends to promise people promotions, and then keep them waiting for very long periods of time. It seems like they do this to keep talented individuals in lower positions as long as possible. Great work environment overall, sometimes scheduling systems leaves skeleton crews running very busy shifts. This is the hardest part of the job, but also forges strong bonds between coworkers. Personally the most enjoyable part of the job has been learning to make perfect drinks to impress customers."
good,"- co workers are bullies"
good,I can honestly say Starbucks was an amazing job ! Customers were great and coworkers were always united ! Management always worked with you and always tried to help.
good,"I learned more about customer service working at Starbucks than I had in any of my previous jobs. Starbucks partners are the friendliest, and most hardworking people I have ever met. Their motto is to ""Make Every Moment Right"". Working there has raised my standard for customer service and taught me the importance of going the extra mile for customers."
good,"This job was a lot of fast paced work with really cool people, but it was poor in the money department. We have a lot of other benefits that were amazing and made it worth while."
good,"Diverse people who come together, communicate strongly and provide a great experience for each and every customer. A lot of great room for growth. benefits are a plus"
good,"While this job can be stressful and takes a while to get into, it is very rewarding in the end. My supervisors are understanding and care about the job that they're doing. Customer focus is a huge part of working at Starbucks and I love doing that work."
good,"Working with Starbucks, it's hard not to befriend your partners. (Starbucks employees refer to each other as partners because we all have a choice to invest in stocks.) Starbucks also offer benefits, health insurance, and career advances. "
good,"Working at Starbucks was an Experience ill never forget. It was always busy. The management was good but could have been better. Best part was my coworkers. The hardest part was the customers but I'm happy to say I have now mastered customer service! I've learned that mo matter what you just need to get through the day, no matter if you're having a good day or bad day; just get through it and tomorrow can be however you want to make it! overall if I could do it again, I would do it all the same!"
good,"A typical day involves greeting and assisting customers while serving the worlds best coffee in a fast paced environment, all while creating personal connections that last a lifetime."
good,"A typical day at work is usually good, depending on the day and what has to be done in the store. Generally Thursdays are the busiest days. The weekends are the least busy. Management is alright, the coworkers are quite nice, you tend to build a family connection with them after a while. The best part of the job was usually the good interactions with the customer when they leave happy and satisfied with their time there, also it would be interacting with the regulars in the area."
good,"Responsable de shift, de la qualité des produits et du stock"
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced, progressive company with great coworkers but little room for advancement. The pay is average for the industry, but the benefits are good, even for part-time employees. The company is extremely flexible with scheduling and availability, which is convenient for people with other priorities such as second jobs or school."
good,"A day in the life of a barista is a little hectic, but great. When I first clock in a go straight to bar and make drinks all day long. Throughout the day you have to deal with some pretty cranky customers and keep a level head while doing so. The hardest part of my job is being on my feet for 8+ hours, constantly moving. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping start peoples days off right and bringing a smile to there face."
good,"Two thumbs-up. The partners at my home-store in Leominster really went out of their way to take care of me as a newbie and grow with me as a veteran employee. "
good,"Starbucks is a very high volume environment to work in, I feel that if you can handle doing a million things at once, like you often do at starbucks, then you can handle a great deal of responsibility."
good,"Mon expérience chez Starbucks à réellement été très enrichissante, particulièrement durant la période de mes études, où la flexibilité des horaires m’accommodait parfaitement pour entreprendre en même temps la réussite de mes études et un épanouissement au sein de la compagnie. J'ai bien aimé mon expérience chez Starbucks."
good,The environment was well put and I gained much experience. The coworkers helped me feel wanted and helped me learn a lot of feeling comfortable among a group of people.
good,"Barista work consists of making and serving drinks in a timely manner, as well as maintaining a clean and friendly work place."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. Working there provides growth in leadership and in work experience. The entry level benefits help prepare a lifestyle of stability.
good,"I worked as a barista completing orders and working the cash register. "
good,Overall our store is too busy to talk and connect with customers and the environment is incredibly hectic. We deal with too many tourists and we are short staffed and corporate is being stingy with the hours so every night we must make do with the little staff we get left with.
good,It was fun to work with coworker and get to learn about a whole variety of coffee. But most of all it was nice to interact with customers that come everyday and create a connection that I don't believe I would have with any other job.
good,There cant be anything more to ask for when you break through here. Amazing work place and work culture. There is a game corner where you can relax when you want to. They organize tournaments and are rewarded to boost participation.
good,Really loved the environment and workplace. I felt the management sucked and our store manager was never there. Training took forever to even start and I was forced to keep up and learn on my own mostly.
good,"Its hard to say how the day will be when you come in but you know that its not gonna be a boring one. Our store is close to the campus for google and Microsoft, so there is always lots of people coming into our store. all the coworkers and the management are great, and effective at our jobs. we usually have at least 2 rushes a day and during the summer time have lots of concerts rushes, so you gotta get good quick at out location. The waves of customers is kind of a bittersweet feeling, although it gets a little hectic it also keeps me busy, which is good. Due to the traffic at our store we have alot of staff working at our small location, so hours are spread thin."
good,Love the atmosphere but can become quite stressful when understaffed and there are many tasks to complete with little to no help
good,"Working the register take the customers order and name,make the coffee beverages, well keeping the area cleaned and organized. Working at Starbucks I got to try new coffee drinks to be able to explain to the customer how the coffee taste and that way maybe they'll want to try it."
good,serving coffee to non morning people. cleaning bathrooms and other areas of the store. learning new life skills for everyday life
good,"Starbucks has a wonderful company culture and allow Store Managers large flexibility with management style, innovation, and business competency. They provide good instruction when necessary and have viable communication."
good,it was a decent work experience my manager was nice. so was my coworkers. The opportunity for advance is great in this company
good,its cool working for Starbucks to much personal going on in the work place though. the only good part of working there is you get to meet some pretty col people.
good,"In Starbucks gent-sint-pieters is het eigenlijk echt leuk werken. Je krijgt een korte opleiding om je een basis meemee te geven en leert al doende wel alle kneepjes van het vak. Je kan gerust eens lachen, ook met de collega's en werkt altijd met een glimlach. Het is een perfecte job voor iemand die graag horeca doet maar dan een '' 9 to 5'' al is dat meer een 5 to 22. Daar zit ook myn enigste minpuntje, dat is het zeer verschillende uurrooster dat je iedere maand krijgt, gelukkig kan je op voorhand wel dagen vrij vragen of shiftwissels met je collega's."
good,"A typical day would be pretty consistence in work requirement. I improved my social skill meeting local and different customers every day.  I learned to worked with co-workers with different types of personalities, age, and worked views."
good,starbucks is great to work for benefit wise but recent labor cuts while the company is busier then ever have really effected morale throughout stores
good,"I value Starbucks for maintaining a professional reputation in both product quality and customer service. The work is enjoyable, the employees are all agreeable, fun and friendly, and the customers are easy to work with."
good,"Great co-workers, free food and drinks while working. Paid ten minute breaks. thirty minute lunches and tips weekly. I would clock in and begin my duties on bar, front or drive through. I would clean the cafe and bathrooms before leaving my shift. This may also include doing all the dishes during closing routine."
good,"Working at HMS Host as a Barista in Starbucks at the airport was one of my favorite jobs. I enjoyed the fast paced environment, the coworkers and being able to meet new people on a daily basis. However, the management was not the best at all."
good,I would come in to work and have to make all the coffee and teas. i learned how to work hard in a professional manner. This job also tough me how to have great costumer service while i had to deal with everyone each day. The hardest part of this job is having to be quick so your customers do not get irritated.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"Worked for the company for two years and love the team environment, customer interaction, and benefits. "
good,"If you need a safe, steady job with flexibility, you won't find much better for minimum wage. Not good for the financially crippled adult."
good,"The size of the organization allows those who desire mobility to have numerous opportunities to move throughout the company.  Depending on one's appetite for leadership, you can quickly set yourself apart from peers."
good,Great job with flexible hours. My co-workers make it all worth while. My manager is very attentive and she is pretty much always available.
good,"There's always ups and downs, unfortunately I went from a well oiled older store with an amazing management staff to a brand new store with no asm, and the sm is literally the worst manager in the world. I have single-handedly watched my manger turn amazing employees to people who just don't care. I have spent most of my time in this out of whack store, so I would say my thoughts are a little damaged and it is unfair to the company. I do have on thing to say, they either need to pay their baristas and shifts more, or allow more hours for more employees so everyone isnt doing 3 jobs. It' sad that I turn down promotions because it's not worth the stress."
good,The job wasn't all that bad. I love the people that i worked with. They were very friendly and they acred about one another and made the work environment all that exciting.
good,I really enjoyed my time with Starbucks. Its a great company to work for and they really take care of their people. The Cumming store is very fast paced which makes time go by faster.
good,"Coworkers were always a blast to see, developed personal relationships with regular customers and was always a joy to see them. Job became basically hanging out with friends and making coffee after a certain point. There were a few sour moments but that comes with any job you have. Management always tried to micro-manage, but that was the orders they received from their superiors. Overall great experience walked away with better work ethic and a better perspective on what it means to have a satisfying job."
good,"I've worked at 4 different Starbucks stores and each had a different culture. Everything has an effect on it, but the manager has a fundamental role in setting the tone. If the manager stresses you out in the interview, he or she will probably stress you out at work. However, Starbucks gives you great tools to create a good work/life balance. Pay sucks, but take advantage of free college and my math puts that at a 5-6$ per hour wage increase. Cafe stores are better to work at than drive-through stores, but there are fewer openings because there is less turnover (employees are happier). Also, pay is better at cafe stores, not because the wages are better, but because tips are typically 0.75-2.00 per hour higher at cafe stores than drive-through locations. There are fewer employees to split the tips with, more customers are known by name, and the customer experience is generally better."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks started at 4am, opening shift, with a strict routine and goal list. I loved starting the day with my customers and creating an inspired moment for my regulars and new customers. I learned how to truly work as a team . My co-workers and I had to help each other and work together to get drinks and food out with efficiency and as fast as possible. The hardest part of the job was being new and getting overwhelmed by the fast-paced environment. After I got used to it and learned the routines, I excelled extremely fast and was partner of the month the first month I was there and partner of the quarter."
good,"des journée de travaille avec un grand sourire, toujours donner le meilleur service"
good,"I enjoyed my time with Starbucks, but left due to the high stress environment not matching the compensation I was provided."
good,"Mornings are usually busy and I have to be able to get started with no delay. There are times when the store is very busy at peak and also can be slow in the afternoons. I learned that it is very important to be clear with what you want in the workplace so that everything can run efficiently. Since some customers may take their time, I have learned to be patient since everybody is not hurried like others during rushes. It is fun to work with other baristas because many of them are students, which I can relate to. The hardest part of the job is when a customer is aggravating and can create a lot of stress at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you create a connection between the customer and yourself and can have conversations about everyday life."
good,"Starbucks is by far the best job I've ever had. Working with coffee is a pleasure for me, especially when the majority of my customers come in every day and we know each other by name. My co-workers are some of my closest friends and I love each and every one of them! Each of the managers I've had while working here have been amazing, the current one is extremely helpful with training and very down to earth when it comes to working side by side with each of the Starbucks partners at the store."
good,"Wear not nice clothes and comfortable shoes. This job has taught me how to handle stress, multitask, have responsibilities and work under a lot of pressure. the most enjoyable part of the job is some of the people you meet, learning more about coffee and the benefits that the company has to offer you. What's not so great is the getting up super early and how much stress you go through during one shift."
good,"the day often start quite until 8 am which is the peak time, i learn how to satisfy customers on a daily , I am working with a great team we all get along and work in a friendly environment"
good,"It is a great option for starting professionals."
good,The  co-workers are great. They are willing to work around your schedule but they still want you to work full time. The hours are good. This Starbucks is part of King Soopers so the perks are different from the stand alone stores. It is a good place to work for  short term if you are looking for a different career path or long term if coffee is your cup of tea.
good,"Make drinks, attend to the cash register, clean the entire store, stock all inventory, highly a customer service job. Great atmosphere and lively workers and customers."
good,"A typical day consisted of a long line from about 9 am - 3:30 pm with lulls in between classes. Afterwords consists of restocking and preparing for the next day. Overall, a very simple operation. This location was one of the busiest Starbucks accounts in the Northwest, and so it can get very hectic. The full-timers are great and are well experienced and will carry the weight of the team where needed, while also being great instructors. They know the BEST way to run the store that poses the least amount of work and issues. Having no prior coffee experience, being trained by these two ladies and the student workers they have taught made the job way easier.  "
good,a very busy place with good people. my managers and supervisorss were very understanding.met great people in this location. my coworkers made the learning experience fairly easy.
good,"Make beverages"
good,"I learned to make Starbucks Signature drinks,  Enjoyed waiting on the customers, and enjoyed my fellow employees.  Marriott provided us with a full free lunch every day."
good,"Responsibilities:"
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks. Its a faced paced environment and the pay is good. They train there employees well. I was fortunate to work with a great crew.
good,In my day I'm dealing with culture of the store. Putting up orders and making sure all cash is taken care. Giving breaks and making sure every employee is taken care of. Hardest part is making everyone in the store have a good time
good,"A typical day at work serving coffees to drinks as we offer food to match with their beverage to maximize the taste, I've learned how to communicate with individuals better and to create moments of connection with our guests to make them feel welcomed. Management is constantly changing, in a span of 10 months, i have had 3 new managers but overall due to the high level of stress in the store, the culture of forever changing. My Co-workers is the only reason why I always look forward to work, the way they make the job enjoyable, easy and fun makes the workplace happy. The hardest part of the job is staying mentally stable due to the high turnover rates, I myself is barista trainer and I've met many colleagues come and go due to management. The most enjoyable part is our norm, with Starbucks' high quality standards, I am privileged to work for the company."
good,"Starbucks is an exceptional company to be a part of the team at. There was always something new to learn, be it coffee knowledge or a new way to do a task you thought you knew inside and out. There is always room for growth. Most of the time your coworkers are superb and fun, like-minded people to work with. The hardest part of the job is definitely keeping a level head and a cool mind when things may not always go according to plan, the calmer you remain, the easier it is to get through. The most enjoyable part was the constant customer interaction. Getting to know your clientele and feeling like an important part of their day is so rewarding."
good,This is a great company to work for. The management can be difficult depending on the store you work at. They have great benefits.
good,I have learned what it takes to be a leader. I started when I was sixteen years old and worked my way up to be a trusted supervisor.
good,"Basically id clock in at the cash register, hop into the back to prep food, throw away boxes, take out the trash, wash dishes, help wherever needs to be helped, jump in the front line to help make up the sandwiches."
good,"Great please to work to know & understand your guest name & choices of drinks"
good,The people I got to work with are so much fun and I know they will be lifelong friends. Always something to work on at such a busy store.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks I would assign a register greet and ring up    customers then gathering food if they purchase pass the drink down to bar and they whip it up.Other task are sweeping,changing trashes,and making backs ups for drinks ingredients."
good,"Although the experiences with working for Starbucks are positive, the demands of the position of Starbucks Store Manager are quite high. If you enjoy working with people and building a successful team that provides exceptional customer service this is the job for you."
good,"Great company. Exceptional benefits package for part time work. Very flexible with your personal schedule, especially your school schedule. Free stocks earned after a year of employment. Amazing partner perks, discounts, free coffee and food during your shifts..."
good,"Working at Starbucks has been a wonderful experience. I enjoy the fast-paced environment and i have learned to overcome daily obstacles as they occur. This is definitely a place where co-workers have fun while being at their best. Part of the job is the willingness to tend to every customer individually and the flexibility to understand what they need. I have learned allot coming into this job. I have learned how to prioritize, multitask, and assist customers all at once."
good,"Working for Starbucks is one of the most important learning experiences I have had to date.  I have acquired strong interpersonal skills and communication tactics.  As a supervisor, I manage a team and day to day tasks in a fast pace and unpredictable atmosphere which almost always come with challenges.  Sometimes, you come across a customer service situation that sets you up to fail.  Some customers will come into Starbucks with a negative attitude that you can't seem to turn around.  I have 9 years of customer service experience, and even at my best I feel degraded by another's sense of entitlement every so often.  Its something you learn to brush off."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy. I am able to build relationships with people on a daily basis.  I performed many duties such as food preparation, drink preparation, customer service, and money handling."
good,"Wow, Working for this company has been amazing! I have had so many great experiences happen to me through this company and many monument moments that i will never forget. I thank my great team or crew of managers that have helped me build more skills with in customer service and management. I appreciate all the fun and the opportunity to work with such good people."
good,"If you love to engage in conversation with new people everyday in a relaxing and stress-free environment, Starbucks is the place to work."
good,"Very good team and management to improve customer service skill. It is also good place to improve your work efficiency."
good,"This job is for people who are quick on their feet, don't mind getting super messy every day, and who have excellent memories. It pays minimum wage, so not the best in money, but they give you tons of free drinks and snacks and items and have an employee discount. The majority of people who work there are cool and management is pretty awesome. Flexible hours and lots of benefits for full time, including free college and sports leagues."
good,"The tasks aren't necessarily difficult, but the load of work can be exhausting. Customer service is a huge thing for this company so keeping calm under pressure is always tested. So much goes on at once so multi-tasking is a must, But once you get the hang of everything, the day tends to fly by. They have a image to uphold so all the training and counseling is legit and will help you become the person you need to keep up."
good,"A typical day of work for me is early at the crack of dawn"
good,"I really liked everything about working here.  The staff was amazing, the work could get intense connecting with customers.  The Benefits were amazing."
good,Starbucks was a great Job to have! I really enjoyed meeting all sorts of people each day. Also knowing our customers by name with the drink they ordered was pretty cool too.
good,"A typical days is fast paced with continues lines of people. "
good,Starbucks has a fast pace environment and can be fun when you have many tasks to be done. It's fun when you have drinks to make and be creative to do so. I find it interesting to learn about coffee and where it comes from different parts of the world.
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with and the experience I had working at starbucks. I believe it gave me good experience to go and apply to similar customer service jobs in confidence.
good,"I worked for Starbucks to supplement my income at time. Marin County housing is expensive, and I wanted to be able to have a place of my own. Co-workers were young and outgoing. I enjoyed interacting with co-workers and customers. Management was very flexible with my weekly schedule."
good,I loved my co-workers and also my customers it was a wonderful place to work and to be yourself i learned alot of new things
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. They're flexible and understanding with their employees. The environment is busy, but with a positive attitude, it can be very fun! Knowing how to make drinks and learning how to socialize with customers on a deeper level is a great skill to have."
good,"Working for Starbucks has been an altogether positive experience. It is fast-paced, demanding, and a lot of fun. Starbucks capitalizes on customer experience, and from that I have made some really valuable connections."
good,My typical day at work would be making drinks and making sure the store is clean 100% from a customer point of view. While working at Starbucks I've learned working well with others. Being apart of the management team allows me to share my knowledge amongst my coworkers. The hardest part of my job would be not seeing my customers come in with a smile everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job would be knowing that I have made my customers day and also working with friendly people while doing it.
good,An average day at Starbucks consists of smiles and laughs. Starbucks teaches a person to have speed and knowledge. Management and baristas are very skilled in multi tasking. Co workers are helpful and knowledgeable.
good,"Absolutely  love the customers "
good,"During my day at work I have to prepare coffee based drinks and operate the till serving customers regularly. I have to fill and rotate the stocks and be sure the workplace is lean ant tidy all the time. I have the chance to improve my customer service, communication skills and team working. I learned how to interact with customers and how to work in team expecially during the rush."
good,At Starbucks the only thing I can comment is the people who work in the company specially the management people. People management at Starbucks needs to Improve
good,"Starbucks can be stressful at times, but it is a great place to work. The management team creates an uplifting work environment.  Employees end up becoming family.  I had great people skills already, but working for Starbucks made my customer service skills grow exponentially.  Being part of the Sbux community is an awesome accomplishment"
good,"A typical day at work was very laid back, there is no strenuous work involved. Mostly a very great work environment but the occasional cranky customer is the only downside."
good,Starbucks is a very fast paced work environment. I learned a lot from making drinks to making sure our customers have the best experience possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet all kinds of people and the great benefits that they have available to the partners.
good,Very stressful but increases your multitasking and communication skills in a high pace environment. Provides excellent benefits. Management is very helpful.
good,"It was great working at Universal Studios Starbucks. Getting to see all the different people and little kids. I loved being a cashier at Starbucks! Making the Guest's vacation experience wonderful. Especially when you saw the little children. Making them smile, was and will always be well worth it. Writing their names on the cups made each guest feel special and unique."
good,"Works well with keeping up a lifestyle separate from work. Good hours, decent pay, work doesn't come home with you. Customer-centric, lots of focus on making everyone's experience unique"
good,"if you want to work there try it out and see if you like it. the experience is cool, just see. idk what else to say they want me to keep talking"
good,It was a great job to get customer service experience. I really enjoyed talking to new customers and customers that always comes.
good,"It was great! I had the advantage with working with mostly new people. Our shifts were amazing! But the manager wasn't so great, she picked favorites and could never get the schedule right for people who in school. Scheduling some people at completely different locations without asking if we were available for said shift half way across town."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs I've ever had the pleasure of working. The only issue was it was a new store and at times it could get chaotic but we worked through it pretty well."
good,The customers. I am a very social person the talking to all the customers was the best part of the job. The staff was also great and the manager was amazing. when she found out I was having a kid she gave me all the close her kid had all ready out grown
good,You'll meet plenty of amazing people that will touch your heart in ways that you never thought was possible. They are all my family now.
good,Fast paced and fun. Loved meeting new people and the customers are great. If you are a lover of caffeine this place is perfect.
good,"I enjoyed managing my team everyday and having intellectual conversations. I am very passionate about my workspace and what I want to achieve everyday, I instill my values within my team to make them feel as comfortable as possible."
good,"Overall it's a nice hardworking job, but depending on the store you work at your training can be forgotten about or you might not work many hours. I had 2 home stores while working at Starbucks and at both stores it felt like home for the most part I had great co-workers (personality wise) to work with. But a lot of the time my co-workers were lazy or couldn't work and hold a conversations so if they didn't do their share of work before going home someone else would have to pick up the slack. That's something I noticed more when I had to deal with more when I got promoted to Shift Supervisor since you are the one to be blame for why the store looks the way it does. I could stay here and type all day but i doubt you would sit here and read it. So I recommend you find a store with a friendly and organized store manager to make the whole experience easier. If you feel like your being neglected because you have less hours, or your training isn't up to standard you should say something to your Store Manager, District Manager, or Partner Resources. I've seen and heard endlessly of unhappy partners and it probably would've been avoided if they said something to the right people."
good,"This is a great place to work if you want to upgrade from fast food and still make decent money. You gain great experience and deal with a different cliental. "
good,"Starbucks is a great job, if only minimum wage.  It can be mentally and physically exhausting during peak times of the day, but if you have a good team and a good manager, it can flow quite well. "
good,"As long as the management is good, then it is absolutely a fantastic group to work for. Health, vision, dental are huge perks. Add in a friendly work environment and one can be pretty content working there."
good,"counting my drawer before each shift and working the register. Taking beverage orders upon request, also keeping the dessert case fresh. My manger was very energetic and bubbly, never left the café unless it was clean and everything has been stocked properly. My manager always made sure before he left, he made it easy for us to get through the day. My co-workers were very funny, and always around to make sure everything was proper, we helped each other and always made the best of every day. The most difficult part of the job was looking the guest in there face and telling them we are out of something their taste buds were set on. The most enjoyable was being able to taste all  new desserts whenever we got them"
good,Always dealing with customer service at its finest. Being able to work in a fast paste environment. I enjoy being able to learn how to multi task and be able to enjoy doing what i do at my job.
good,"I'm a coffee lover, so it was great to learn how to make drinks. "
good,Worked for Starbucks for over a decade.  Advancement through the company has been steady and new learning opportunities present themselves frequently.  Getting things finished quickly can sometimes be a problem.  Too many meetings and decision makers can delay otherwise simple projects and deliverables.
good,"I enjoyed working with Starbucks. While sometimes there were difficult customers, my store's management handled them well. Our team was well built and we all worked well together. I never had any non-customer related experiences."
good,A typical day at Starbucks is exciting and enjoyable while working with them i further my management experience. my manager was good to me.co workers where like family the hardest part of the job would be delegating once you got that down pack everything was pretty much a breeze the most enjoyable part was the energy the customer and partners.
good,"Its a fun job that can sometimes be a little hard as the holly days come around, but overall has good and friendly atmosphere."
good,"If you're looking for a job that isn't too difficult, you need flexibility and you want some perks with it, I would recommend Starbucks. It depends on location definitely but, the company isn't too bad to work for."
good,"Great work place enviroment, management is very easy to work with along with the OHL management team and lead supervisors."
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks involves a mix of running around trying to keep all beverage components stocked, brewing coffee constantly, making specialty drinks, handling customer complaints and having fun with people who have not only become my friends, but my family."
good,Good work environment and great place to learn in many areas as a professional and personally. The management team are fully trained and great people to learn from daily. The customers are the best part of my day. Most of them come pretty early in the morning just to get a cup of coffee to start their day but connecting with them as Starbucks taught us has taught me  so much and making the customers day is really a great and satisfying expirence.
good,"A typical day at work is to always be on time and don't be late.  Try and be optimistic and have a positive attitude,knowing that 10% is what happens in life but that 90% is how you react to it. Always listen to what someone is telling you. Respect others. In doing so you learn that you will gain respect by giving respect. How you react to a situation is the most important thing to keeping a job, co-workers happy and enjoying what you do and those you work with."
good,"Working as a Starbucks team member is fun and really nice when you have the right coworkers with you. But, be prepared to deal with being by yourself often and no back up."
good,"On a normal shift at Starbucks, once clocking on you either are on bar making drinks, front register or drive thru register getting each customers orders, or customer support which is keeping the store stocked and clean. I learned valuable customer service skills, and how to make delicious coffee, lattes, and teas. At first management was a little insecure since most baristas did not get along with the manager, later management changed and the store was a wonderful area to work with. Everyone in a Starbucks wants to work together as a team, so co-workers are easy to get a long with. The job was overall enjoyable to me, the hardest part was lifting ice buckets or coffee filled makers. Apart from that, even  through crazy rushes the job was enjoyable."
good,I had many moments where I enjoyed working at starbucks... I love the coffee and snacks. I also enjoyed the coworkers I had
good,"Develops sense of urgency, excellent team work, time management, and customer service. Excellent support and benefits. Advancement within company not fast enough for my liking."
good,"With over 20 years of tradition, Starbucks has changed how drinking  a latte should feel like. Working there isn't bad, and for something to have while searching actively for other things to do, it's a good plae to be. That said it's not where one should try to stay, sometimes you may get burned."
good,"A typical day at work was crazy, hectic and fun. Crazy because once you started your shift, it was nuts. Always rushing around and doing things, unless you were on register. then your just stuck there."
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for however the customers are something else. It is very interesting how someone can pay $5 for a cup of  coffee. I liked to work there over the summer though, it was fun."
good,"Opening the store for morning shift, preparing all the store. Brewing coffee, punching items on micros database. I learned about coffees from different countries, more on the taste of it. Developing my skills to customer and employee relation. the most enjoyable part of the job is when doing a coffee tasting and sharing the customer the information about the coffee."
good,Fast paced and highly customer interactive. Innovative strategies to create constant growth within the company. Always chasing new targets with new incentives. Fun everyday working environment with great benefits.
good,"There is something to be said for the simple joy that comes in preparing a quality cup of coffee for someone else and being able to share a smile with them."
good,"The Starbucks that I am currently working at is a fun place to work. Some of the best people i know work there.  The management is ok, and the learning experience is amazing.  I think the best part of this job is knowing that your co-workers have your back in pretty much everything."
good,"The hardest part about this job was dealing with awful customers. People are very difficult to deal with and it takes a toll on working at this job for an extended amount of time. "
good,"Great part time job for students along with benefits. As a barista, I'd prepare drinks, clean/stock the store, and interact with customers."
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for. There are plenty of benefits that are available and there is plenty of room for one to advance in the company. The managers that I worked under have been very agreeable and able to perform their managerial responsibilities professionally. The morning shift was the only real hard part of the job, because all the customers are still waking up and at times be a bit grumpy, yet this would not interfere with my service. I enjoyed making drinks, especially the customized ones, because it was nice to be able to see the look of a satisfied customer."
good,"Bastante trabajo siempre, pero siempre con risas durante la elaboración de productos"
good,Excellent benefits and work-life balance for being an industry leading company. Always had fun with my coworkers and compensation is just for the work being done.
good,"Starbucks is a great company that provides excellent benefits to all employees.  Expect to receive feedback on your performance everyday, and deal with nice and mean customers on a regular basis."
good,It is a great job for young people. It can get very hectic. And it is very fun. It is a great company to work out with all the benefits.
good,"A typical day at work had its highs and lows in the sense that customer flow was unpredictable.  I learned how to make new drinks almost daily, and the management - as well as co-workers - were supportive in all aspects of day-to-day operations of the store. The most difficult part of my job was assisting demanding customers whom I treated with assumed positive intentions.  The most enjoyable part of my job was when our regular customers returned every day, and I got to know many of them."
good,"I love everyone I work with. However management is sometimes hard to handle. Some ignore your preferred schedule completely and often you don't know your schedule more than a week in advance. The company does come with a lot of great benefits for those working 20+ hours a week, healthcare, free classes through ASU. Every partner gets one food, 2 free drinks a shift, and a pound of coffee a week. "
good,Such a great work and school balance. Great Compensation and benefits. Great work environment. Great Management. Great Job Culture.
good,The enviorment was a very fun one especially around the holidays! The only problem was my manager didn't give positive feedback to employees when needed and caused many to quit because they felt like they just were not improving.
good,"Great company to work for, but the face paced level is not for everyone. Offer great benefits and perks for employees. Only downsides are the hours can be rough and it's hard to get promoted within the company."
good,It just needs better management and more discipline and better understanding of one another. The manager could use a more adaptable location to work at 2300rd in Jackson isn't for her.
good,"Excellent training and emphasis on World Class Customer Service. New products, sometimes overwhelming. Super on health benefits and perks"
good,"Always busy.  Customers are great, management needs some work.  You have to be able to make 5 drinks at a time or your time there will be miserable. Customers are the best part, your coworkers not so much."
good,"A job that always looks good on my resume. I started as a barista and communicated to my manager I was getting bored with my job's roles. He encouraged me to move ahead in the company and I became a Barista Trainer, then Quality Assurance Lead, and then - after a lot of work and an interview with the district manager - I was promoted to Supervisor."
good,"Starbucks is a great corporation to work for, they try and do a lot for their employees. We recently recieved free premium spotify, we get full time benefits for working 20 hours a week, free drinks and a food item when we work, free lb of coffee or tea canister a week, it's just a really great place. The only thing I've run into that I personally don't like, is recently starbucks has gotten strict about drive thru times and sending people through quickly and when management gets wound up and getting behind it makes my job less fun and hard to engage with customers. Also, I've only been there about 6 months and most of the employees have yet to make me feel at home or like a family (like other jobs I've had) but I think it's just me and obviously it isn't the corporation!"
good,Great company to work for just like it is known for.  Always exciting and usually fast paced when working but it is definitely hard work.  Always came home smelling like milk.
good,Great co-workers in a fast paced restaurant and pub atmosphere. positive attitudes allways when i was at work. Great service to guest when they came in and especially asked for my services
good,"Buena empresa para emprender el desarrollo laboral, ya que puede desarrollarse en todos los campos de la administración."
good,"While the benefits are great, Starbucks did not provide enough hourly compensation for the baristas to be able to live without having to make major cutbacks or get a second job. They also more recently took away their twice a year raises based on independent work performance and  changed it to a once a year raise based on the average work performance of the district. The family type environment is amazing and co-workers tend to be out of this world but it is very hard to want to stay in a company when you're not able to pay for the basics to live."
good,"So far so good; I am still learning, but my training was pretty hands on and fast paced. You have to learn quickly to make it in this company."
good,"As of this moment, there has been a load of responsibility thrusted upon baristas and shift managers. IT's too much work for a minimum wage job, however this is a great job for students. "
good,"I loved working as a Barista at Starbucks. Mornings were busy as usual an the afternoons were steady, with a pop here and there. The customers overall were very friendly and outgoing. Learning new drinks every season was fun. Also learning how customers like to add different twist to there drinks that we already have, was also entertaining. The co-workers were always up beat and positive making it feel like friends more than co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to remember so many of the regulars drinks that come in everyday!!! What I loved most about the job was getting to meet new people on a daily basis and the free drinks!!!!"
good,"O dia-a-dia era corrido, pois havia uma grande quantidade de clientes, principalmente aos finais de semana. "
good,employees were great like family and they were like my own kids the only issue was with upper management not knowing how to talk the staff or their managers
good,"The job was awesome, customers were great, but management was a little hands-off. Too many shift supervisors trying to do a manager's job made it difficult."
good,typical day at work is always a fast paced environment a good job if you like to move around quick co workers were always helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how the drinks were made and making them even better to the customers request
good,"Starbucks is just a really fun place to work.  The pay is ridiculous and you work hard, but the people and the customers and the atmosphere make it just about the place to work in the world.  Starbucks promotes from within and offers great benefits if you can make it through the first 6 months.  I felt like the customers were part of my family and I still miss them."
good,"Starbucks is a company you can work your way up in and provides excellent benefits, 401k, and stock options.  Working in the stores is very demanding but also very fulfilling."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for seven years and i loved it.  I did experience some burn out towards the end,  the job itself is pretty exhausting.  Great managers, great staffs, great benfits, lots of opportunity."
good,"great work space, fun and hard working employees."
good,"Fun work place with supportive and understanding management. There is a balance between company goals and employee goals. "
good,Working at Starbucks as a barista after earning a college degree has definitely made me a more humble person. I have improved my social skills as well as become more outgoing. I have learn to work in a fast-paced environment with other people as a team to serve customers promptly.
good,I loved being a barista. My regular customers were always so enjoyable and fun to talk to. The company in itself is a good one to work for.
good,"Excelent team work, good management. Better service everyday with the clients. I learned good teamplay with the co-workers, how to provide a good servce to the client (Anticipate, connect, personalize and gain), make from work an enjoyable enviroment for me and my co-worker. Difficult part from the work are the constant rush hours, but with the ability to have good atmosphere."
good,A day at work required you to have lots of energy and to be ready to be on your feet a significant amount of time. Everyday was busy and you had to be able to handle stress well. Management wasn't too consistent. Co-workers were always enjoyable at the most. Hardest part of the job would be having to be so upbeat and fast all the time. Most enjoyable part of the job probably is who I met and all the customers.
good,"There is always something new to learn or a challenging problem to engage and solve. The best part of the job is the the team and people with which I get to work. A lot of the job an issues are ambiguous, but the right resources are usually made available to move forward."
good,"Typical work day consisted firstly of World Class Customer Service, as well as cash management, delegating, multi-tasking, continually learning and growing."
good,If you enjoy working as a team in a fast paced environment this is a great job. You can work your way up in this company and they have a lot of life long employees there committed to great service.
good,"managing multiple people on the schedule, providing excellent customer service, inventory management, seeing regulars is the most enjoyable."
good,Early mornings or late nights. First priorities are customers and standards of the company being met at all times. Promote individuality and a lot of room for advancement. Each day we provide excellent service while create quality beverages and food items for each guest.
good,"I have learned a lot from this company about on-going business strategy, business plan and how to plan and organized, meeting business dead line , rules and regular,  cash handling, business activities  and inventory, well good training  and P&L report etc...."
good,It was a great company to work for! I was able to advance if desired and was acknowledged for my work. I feel that their benefits for employees was the best perk!
good,"A typical day at work consists of cash handling, looking through applications and assisting the store manager grow the business. I learned so much from my experiences with this company. My biggest take away from my time here is learning to adapt the way I train and coach to the way a learner learns. The hardest part of my job is balancing what I think is the best course of action to handle certain situations without stepping on the store managers toes so-to-speak. The absolute best part of my job is the customers. I am a people person and I have learned so much from the people I've served coffee to."
good,"Great place to work. Always had fun while there. Management was a little under trained and we were sometimes understaffed, but I enjoyed my time there."
good,"A typical day consisted of serving customers while interacting with coworkers. When the store was less busy, the workers tended to be happy."
good,Worked my way through college here and it was a wonderful part time job.  Staff was great and management was wonderful.  I was compensated well and even rewarded for good work.  Wonderful corporate culture as well!
good,"The work was hard and the store I worked at was a real flagship for the company. We occasionally had celebrities and the head of the East Coast of Starbucks come in for coffee. Also, we had one or two silly or badly formed practices with how certain parts of the store needed to be stocked for appearance."
good,"i found working there great as i learned many new things and also taught many new things."
good,I had an overall positive experience working for Starbucks. I enjoyed working in my team based environment and having support from all of my co workers and management.
good,"This is a great job to have if you're a high school student looking for something part time or a college kid just looking for some extra cash. They (management) work with your schedule, from what I've experienced at least, and support you in school endeavors. Very good environment to work in if you want to learn how to work with a team. Teamwork and good communication are essential here. Starbucks as a company is getting better.. Giving all employees a set raises, allowing tattoos to be visible now, the ASU tuition reimbursement online schooling option too! They are trying. The only thing they need to do is make their pay higher. Baristas still can't afford to live on less than $9/hr.. This is why I had to leave. Even with my management offering me a promotion to shift, I still wouldn't make enough to afford rent AND be able to save money for emergencies."
good,"Starbucks is one of the company that focuses on training for their employees that helps them to grow more. The partners will learn a lot of things from their co- workers because the management team will never stop from motivating partners to be more productive everyday. What I like about the culture of Starbucks is they are treating everyone, equally. Especially the customers they make them feel that Starbucks is there Third Place."
good,A very busy environment. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful on the job and customers are generous. The hardest part about this job is that it tends to get many orders in a matter of minutes. The most enjoyable part of this job is when customers make you their favorite barista.
good,"Overall, working at Starbucks can be pretty fun. It can get hectic at times when there are morning and afternoon rushes, but you have the rest of your co-workers to support you. The hardest part of the job would be to deal with some difficult customers, but don't let one person dampen your day."
good,"Starbucks is a great job to work for. It's flexible work hours and tuition reimbursement make it very convenient for college students. Throughout the years i have learned so much. Customers make my day, especially the regulars. I enjoy making each customers visit more enjoyable by speediness, cleanliness and accuracy. I also have to do other ""behind the scenes"" tasks such as cash management, inventory, delegating tasks to each employee and daily training to them as well. As a supervisor, I also occasional have to call a service center for needed repairs to the store. "
good,"A typical day is ensuring product is stocked, perfect beverages are made and serving awesome customers.  I learned a lot from this job in the form of dealing with customers.  Even if it is something small just apologize and come up with a solution.  They just want to know that you are listening and you truly want to make it right and make them happy.  The management is awesome.  They make sure that they tell you when you are doing a good job and if there are corrections that need to be made they will sit down with you and talk to you like you are a human being.  The co-workers are the best!  You are like a small family.  You care so much for each other and watch out for each other.  The hardest part is making every customer happy because there are just some people that are having a bad day that you just can't make happy but you do your best and that is all that you can do.  I enjoyed getting to know a bunch of people on a personal level, co-workers and customers combined.  It is nice when you are able to have that connection with people."
good,Great place to work for students and other part time workers.  Everyone is kind and professional.  Making and learning about coffee was always exciting.  Making customers happy was easy with coffee. Love the coffee culture and everything they came with.
good,"considero que es uno de los mejores para trabajar, llegar a turno con la sonrisa de cada chico hace que todo sea mas divertido se le llama rach a los momentos de alta venta que empiezan de 4:00 p.m a 9:00 p.m aveces mas, se aprende a trabajar bajo presión de los clientes y la meta de ventas pero es parte del aprendizaje, considero que los mas dificil son los cierres quedarse hasta tarde limpiando pero es parte del trabajo, lo que mas me encanto son las grandes relaciones creas en día a día, en cada momento se aprende algo nuevo con cada situación."
good,"always verifying cash for other backs and preparing cash, coin shipments for local business that requested them. the only down fall about working here was I wasn't able to interact with guest. some else took care of that"
good,"Great company to work for, wish it wasn't as easy to hire out of company for high management. Hours were good, very flexible, and pay was good starting out. Many ways to move up in the company."
good,"I had many roles at my time in Starbucks such as, being on till, making the drinks, cleaning and taking orders from customers before they reach the till. My favourite role was making the drinks as I found it fun and also, it made my shift go in extremely fast. However, as I worked in a Starbucks in a shopping centre in Glasgow then it could become extremely busy especially at the weekend so the working environment could become quite intense and you had to be 100% focussed so everything was being done efficiently to give the customer the best experience possible."
good,no habia horas de llegada ni salida uno acudia cuando habia que hacer un trabajo muy padre la verdad
good,Starbucks is a great work place for students graduating high school and are in their first year at college. Great to practice communications skills. There are several great benefits as well. Starbucks also works with your scheduling needs to fit your lifestyle outside of work.
good,"Had good team members, and i also liked going to work when i had to and manger was always understanding and was in it for her team"
good,"serving/pleasing the customers to get good sales and good customer feed back."
good,"Always busy, not enough workers. Pay is not so great. Start off at 9.15 which is definitely not enough to make a living in Hawaii. Some of the co workers were alright. management was not so great."
good,Wish that they would increase the pay. The hours werent to bad but management didnot care that you had classes to attend.
good,"Generalmente estoy como cajera ,lo que mas me gusta del trabajo es que aprendo día a día un poco de idiomas ,ya que trabajo en el aeropuerto de Ezeiza ."
good,"Every day is different "
good,"I enjoyed very much my time at Starbucks, I have learn many costumer service based skills in the 2 years I have been in the company. I have a great relationship with my coworkers and I have learned form them the importance of team work in a work environment. The most enjoyable part of my job it's to be able to deliver great quality service to the costumers and enforce a positive work environment."
good,"I've worked at a ton of different Starbucks and they vastly differ from store to store. Customers range from disasters to absolute saints. Management ranges from Diner dash"" organized to Absolute chaos. Hopefully you will be able to find your zen."
good,This was my first job. I learned about work ethic an everything about coffee. I enjoyed working there because I  was able to meet new friends. This job was my outlet because at that time I was going through a difficult situation in my personal life.
good,"Daily duties: make drinks, delegate job responsibilities, order inventory, count deposit, handle any customer service issues."
good,"A typical day at work consists of serving my customers first, and foremost. During down time I delegate and help completed a specific daily task list. I've learned the ins and outs of being a professional barista. I've also learned how to work in the general public, and I've been told I have gift of being able to connect with people at a level many can’t. The management is respectable and my coworkers are amazing. The hardest part of my job is the early start, however it pays off when you’re done with the workday in the early afternoon. The most enjoyable part of my job is being around people and making a difference in their daily routines."
good,"Personally I think I could get paid more with the amount of verbal abuse I get from co workers and customers. Things like that can really affect someone and I'm only making eight dollars an hour, with me being in college I need a job that can ensure that I can last a little longer and not struggle so much."
good,"Worked at Starbucks for three years, more than two of those as a regular Monday - Friday opener. My schedule was pretty consistent - usually worked three or four eight hours and one or two six hour shifts a week. All Starbucks are different but the one I worked at was extremely busy, particularly from 6:30am-9:30am and again around noon and around 3pm when kids would get out of school and people started getting off work."
good,Working at starbucks gives you the chance to work in a fact fun place area and meet lots of new people from all walks of life.
good,"Had to open and close the store. Create daily sales report, do bank deposits, and count tills. Maintained store appearance and reproducible for customer satisfaction."
good,"I loved my time at Starbucks, and I gained lots of valuable experience there. My manager was amazing, willing to help me grow and make sure I had a good work/life balance. He was always finding ways to help me grow, and the abilities I learned there are helping me in other positions now. The hardest part of the job is probably when a crazed customer wants life to be perfect, but they are few, unlike at a few other stores we could mention. On the flip side, I loved interacting with the customers and partners - I met lot's of neat people and gained some great relationships."
good,"I learned about a diversity of people while working as a barista for Starbucks. A typical day of work consisted of half of my starting shift as a cashier and the later half as a barista. Both positions required the ability to interact with customers and provide customer satisfaction. My co-workers were always optimistic and genuinely nice people. The hardest part of the job would be the high volume of drinks at specific hours of the day. The volume of drinks stay the same, but the drink orders would be different each day. The most enjoyable part of the day is that you get to meet new people."
good,"Typical routine at work"
good,"- M H ALSHAYA is one of the largest retailer company in gulf country"
good,"The hardest part of working for starbucks is learning the drinks and once you've got that down, you're good to go!  As long as you like the people you work with, you're going to have fun coming to work.  One of the best parts about working for the company is that they help pay for health insurance if you average 20 hours a week.  Its perfect for people in school or that work another job."
good,"A typical day at work starts with morning customers needing their morning coffee.  Very simple, as most will take their drink and go.  The job is a very easy job to grasp, serve coffee and clean as you go.  All while making sure the customer is happy with the service they received.  "
good,"My days would go quickly as I was good at my job and it helped to pass the time, the store was always kept clean, customers were happy and employees were more than coworkers - they were friends. The management always made sure everyone - both workers and customers were kept happy and satisfied, even during vicious holiday hours, things were maintained in a calm and organized fashion. In the beginning I didn't know what I was in for but my coworkers and customers quickly helped me learn that no matter the obstacle, the work was worth the experience!"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the art of coffee making an seeing the customers enjoying the coffee an cakes starbucks brings.
good,"Starbucks really does have a great benefits package. The work is harder than you would think and sometimes the customers can be really unkind. They offer such great benefits and I think that is why they don't offer a very good pay rate. It isn't minimum wage but it isn't much better. Great job for students or teens, but maybe not the best choice for someone who needs to provide for a family."
good,I work for charges the store has a license to distribute Starbucks products. There is a district manager comes and often to make sure we are following Starbucks procedures so that the stormy keep its license to sell there products.
good,"The store was undergoing a change in management when I was hired and my training was not a first priority on their level. I did not complete much of the computer-led training, but I had some great mentors on the floor and they made sure I was learning on the job."
good,I love working at starbucks because of all the different people im around also I get to build a little relationship with some customers I love my co workers they all are fun and great to work with
good,"Es un trabajo en el cual se debe tener una alta concentración, debido a que la calidad de bebidas deben ser perfectas, siempre se tiene disponibilidad para ayudar y consultar dudas, además de un buen gerente y supervisores los cuales son fundamentales en la organización. Los colegas tienen siempre buena disponibilidad y disposición para enseñar, lo que se contagia rápidamente. Dentro de las cosas "" negativas "" puedo decir que no logramos pasar una de las certificaciones que tiene la empresa por un 0,5%, debido a un error puntual de algunos compañeros, sin embargo se pudo revertir. Lo mejor de trabajo es el trato que se tiene con los clientes, en donde nos visitan seguido gracias a nuestro cálido recibimiento y trato que le damos, ademas de aprendernos sus nombres y ellos el nuestro"
good,"fast paced, friendly co-workers, outstanding company, very helpful, stress-free environment honest place, easy to learn"
good,"A great place to work while being a student- offers flexible hours, great benefits, and a enriching work environment.  Learned a lot from my store manager who I greatly respect."
good,Starbucks is a very fast paced place of work that is really detail oriented and great with customer service. I never knew there was so much to know and learn about coffee and the Starbucks brand of coffee to be exact. The company really takes the time out to make sure you know your stuff. The working environment can be great and your team tends to feel like family.
good,Fun and friendly environment that empowers the Baristas to enrich the customers daily lives one cup at a time. Starbucks is a fast paced environment and a great place to learn and grow.
good,"make drinks to order, with a any and all specifications, ensure the drink is made and held to high quality standards. verify the customer enjoys their order and wish them a great day."
good,Would come into work in the morning and the smell of coffee was the first thing I smelt. I was doing cash and was dealing first with the people who came in through the doors. It was always a positive experience meeting new people and seeing different smiles everyday. It made my day better even though it felt like the day was going by really slow.
good,I learned many valuable skills with my time at Starbucks. I enjoyed the fast paced environment while still being able to work on my individual training and growth as a supervisor.
good,"buena empresa para trabajar, lamentablemente se fue a la banca rota por lo malos manejos de los directivos"
good,Starbucks is a great place to work for people who like coffee or not! The stores always look good and are held to high standards. The routines on a daily basis are well structured and well looked after. The company itself is very reliable and makes sure that every barista and person in management is aware of their responsibilities and opportunities in the company.
good,"this is a great place to work, you get to interact with customers and also to have fun with your co-workers. I have learned a lot with customer service in this environment is just so much fun coming up with new drinks and suggesting drinks for customers and also pairing drinks with pastries."
good,Starbucks is a progressive organization and seems to care for employees and societal issues.  Benefits are extraordinary and affordable.  Coworkers seem to mesh together well
good,Fun and something different to do. Different things to learn and do. Great atmosphere and partners and great environment overall
good,"It was a very positive experience to work with Starbucks Coffee. It was the first company that truly embraced diversity with their people. I had the opportunity to interview and hired kids with low incomes and no bigger aspirations in life for them whom later on became lawyers, engineers, o even store managers. It was definitely a great place to work. You could see how much they supported and believed in their people. People really wanted to work there and I was part of their process. "
good,"Explanation: The job has many benefits if you use it as a stepping stone. Promotion from within is very hard as they like to hire talent from outside the company. Management like to use write-ups as threats and if you do not work the schedule days they need you , they play with your hours and force you into working what they want. The regular customers make the job amazing, so learn while you earn but use the job as a stepping stone to another company."
good,"Starbucks is fun, exciting, great benefits, great people. Starbucks is not easy, laid back, compensating, or management savvy. Working there for benefits is understandable, but I will always say that volunteer work pays more than Starbucks. Its charity. Baristas and shifts are under paid and over worked."
good,Hardest part of the job is time management.  Must be flexible and able to change priorities often.  Training and operations time constantly vary.  High volume fast paced environment.  Must be passionate about job.
good,wonderful place to work at and has amazing benefits! the management at the store i worked at was non existent the whole year i was there. I wish i could go back everyday
good,Learn a lot and room for advancement if you show interest and work hard. Great opportunity to take on a management role. You learn to deal with a lot of different customers
good,"Working as a barista I made drinks, served customers, cleaned, learned about new products, upsold items and also handled money. "
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks is always being busy. My store is next to a high school so we are always busy non stop. Ive learned that working in a coffee environment you are around different customers everyday and you learn so much about them an soon your regulars become a Starbucks family. Ive seen co- workers come and go but so far i have met some really amazing people from working there. The hardest part of the job to me would be the angry customers that yell at you for no reason, but i am used to it an have been dealing with it for so long that it doesn't get to me anymore. I know how to handle them very well. Most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and making someones day. Bringing a smile to there face."
good,"Loved Starbucks. I advanced pretty quickly and the bonus pay that came every week in tips was a nice touch. The medical beniftes were great too. Now they are even paying for school. The biggest gripe I had was the wacky scheduling. During busier terms and were understaffed, there were several times that I had to close the store at 10pm and be back at work at 7am the next day."
good,"I love seeing my customers every single day , i enjoy talking to each and everyone of them they ,"
good,"There were many different positions one may be placed on such as cashier, drive through,to various cleaning jobs. I learned how to work as a time under pressure as well as how to work independently. The hardest part of the job is remaining calm and focusing on the task at hand even when there is a huge rush of customers. The best part is connecting with those customers and ensuring their satisfaction with the company."
good,"Enjoyable culture, fun team environment.  Needs more opportunity to do off-stage work in balance with floor coverage.  Company vision is excellent and consistent store-to-store."
good,"This company has taught me so much in the past near two years that I have been working here. In both stores I was able to work at, I was welcomed with open arms and treated with the utmost respect. On any given day, I would take orders and connect with customers, make drinks and warm pastries in a timely manner, put away inventory, and complete daily cleaning tasks. In working for this company I learned what it was like to work efficiently as both a team and an individual, and I also developed my skills in multitasking and working in a fast-paced environment. We are bound to have rough patches in our day, from dealing with difficult customers and lines that  go out the door to working with peers under stress, but the main lesson I can take from these experiences is to remain patient, composed, and consistent, and everything will go smoothly soon after."
good,very stern on break taking. drama free work place. good pay and great benefits. very fast-paced great place to work. much room for advancement.
good,starbucks was a great experience in which I learned great customer service skills and to work well under pressure. the most enjoyable part was making the drinks and working for a great company.
good,I loved working for starbucks. there are many different people to meet and many different places to go. also the atmosphere is always positive and cheerful.
good,"I have applied every year since 2009 to work with Starbucks Coffee Company. Once I was offered a position as a Barista in 2014, I have been in love ever since! The managers are very flexible and understanding, although sometimes uptight, they are also very passionate and understanding. The benefits are great and they even offer a College Achievement Problem that helps their partners complete their college degrees and gives full tuition reimbursement. I have grown as a person in character, patience, and learned a great deal about customer service while working with Starbucks. I actually love my job!"
good,"This is probably the best job anyone could have to start off. It can be complicated at first to begin but the training is extensive and great. All thru out this job is great to meet new people everyday and be able to do great things for these people. The hardest thing about the job is probably the recipes for each drink, but with practice this can be done well. The most enjoyable part is spending time with co-workers and meeting great people."
good,"There were multiple positions including bar, dtw, dto, fos, os, and store support.  One thing this job taught me was to multitask at a higher level.  It was fun but sometimes it got extremely stressful.  The management is good not great but good."
good,The work was fast-paced and fun--the employees and management were very friendly--but often exciting and not worth the low pay and zero benefits.
good,Too much to say. All I can say is I loved this place. The only thing that bothered me about Starbucks in general was pay. They don't pay much.
good,"- Learned about the different blends of coffee"
good,"A typical day at work would be to set everything up in the morning and continue to do so during the day to ensure fluidity and consistency at work. Being at the top of your game was essential to providing good customer service and rapidity. "
good,"Prepared espresso shots using machines ranging  from manual (lever) to semi-automatic machines. Loaded beans into the machines ,worked side by side with co workers for a quick friendly workflow in order for the  costumer to enjoy the ultimate costumer service experience. Made cappuccinos,Lattes,regular coffee  and frappuccinos use of microwaves knowledge of industrial kitchen Assisted customers in selecting the beverage or beans.Results driven and interacted with customers, handled and scheduling orders. I've learned how to make coffee espresso, and lattes, and how to deal with unsatisfied customers. most enjoyable part of the job is getting customers what they want."
good,"In the past months, I've been working in Starbucks company. I've learned to work under pressure and manage in a high volume atmosphere. I've perform effectively despite sudden deadlines and changing priorities. I'm able and willing to assist co-workers, supervisors, and clients in a cooperative manner and committed to providing total quality work."
good,Learned to communicate clearly and quickly in a fast paced environment. The mission statement is clear and easy to live by both at work and personally.
good,"Working at Starbucks is an amazing experience where you meet the best people to work with and the customers are wonderful 90% of the  time. It's a challenging job, yes, but I wouldn't say hard to do. You're surrounded by a great support network within the company. Benefits, pay, and job security are all fairly good. Unfortunately, the expectations held by the suits in the head office are ridiculous the majority of the time. The strictness of cutting labour hours but increasing sales really decreases the morale in the team due to the constant feeling that we're failing and going nowhere with our goals. Depending on the location you work at, you don't often receive positive feedback about your work ethic and instead, get negative feedback a lot of the time. Many times I've wondered, 'why do I bother?' All in all, in a  job market as bad as ever, this is a great place to work. Like any job, there  will be some downfalls, and this one has few of them, but the few that it has are general and encompassing enough to make an 8 hour shift feel like a week."
good,Good company to work for while you are attending school. Fast pace and the time goes by fast if busy. Was exhausting to stand all day.
good,the environment was really fun and i had learnt how to communicate better since i am handle with various customers everyday. i had good team members. the harder part of the job is to handle customers complaint..the most enjoyable part is being recognise by top management.
good,"I learned a lot about coffee and where they come, the different regions around the world. It was a very enjoyable place to go to the partners were great. The drinks were always delicious, and fun to make."
good,"interacting with customers , providing customers satisfaction , working as a team and the fun of just learning everyday.."
good,"I really Enjoyed working for Starbucks. It provided me an opportunity to Learn about coffee, from sourcing and roasting, to preparation and serving. I also loved the day to day customer contact and partner contact."
good,Starbucks is a wonderful company! I am happy to be a part of what they do and feel blessed to have moved up from the bottom. It has been a  challenging career and I have learned so much about myself in the process.
good,"A typical day for myself involves a continuous line of quality beverages to be made for our customers. It is a very fast paced environment and you have to be able to think quickly while multi-tasking. I've learned how to make many different drinks and food items, how to lead in certain situations, and how to multi-task so that the customer and the store is being cared for at the same time. I very much enjoy my co-workers and see them as my family. The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to do a million things and being asked a million questions at the same time, but you learn to handle the pressure and stay productive. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers and being an addition to good moments and memories throughout their day."
good,"had fun, got bored, typically had some great co-workers. flexible hours for a good work/life balance. get's repetitive and people are really cranky in the morning."
good,"Starbucks is one the most busy retail stores in the industry. "
good,"Most positions at this Starbucks are part-time.  This was a laid back job with friendly co-workers and management.  Many customers you learn by name and get to know, it was nice to see regular faces and get to connect with people as part of a job."
good,"Work Place is fun, work as a team, customer service is my main priority. Make sure it's third home for customers. Management is great. All about partners coffee is great to make. Learned that as easy as a cup of coffee can make someones day. Which I enjoy putting smiles on peoples faces."
good,I started in this company straight out of high school and it has molded me to be the best manager and supervisor that I could possibly be. I loved this company with all everything that it offered us.
good,"Starbucks is a very good company to work for.  The job itself can be a little stressful at times, but it is overall fun.  The benefits are excellent and there are a lot of programs to help its employees."
good,"Starbucks has been an excellent company to work for over the years.  However, I'm missing a piece of professionalism that I crave to develop.  I have and always will look at Starbucks as a leader in taking care of and developing its people.  As a manager, I do find it frustrating that there is so much to do with such little time away from the floor to accomplish it.  However, the employees and customers I get to interact with everyday make it a great place to work."
good,"On a typical day at Starbucks I would be assigned to the bar and make drinks all day. My favorite part of doing that is having conversations with the customers and making the drinks to perfection. The management at Starbucks was pretty good, favoritism  was shown to certain people a little bit. I learned the importance of being on time while working there and how to be a lot more organized."
good,"Great place to work. Accepting of everyone and different lifestyles. Tuition payback helped me pay for my degree. Plus, free coffee!"
good,great place to work at with great music. very happy customers. learned how to make quality beverages and a very fast pace. hardest part of the job was the pressure the customers put on you while waiting for their drinks
good,"Starbucks is a pretty decent company to work for, with many little perks to benefit from. However they seem to assume that these little perks make up for a dismal hourly wage and sometimes lacking weekly hours. It is quite easy to move up to a shift supervisor and even an assistant manager if you desire, however unless you build tenure, the pay will be less than desirable. On the bright side, you meet great people, enjoy a pretty easy job, in a relaxed environment compared to most jobs that you could be working, and you have an unlimited supply of caffeinated beverages at your hands."
good,"The management is great and is all around great job. You have to be people friendly to connect with the customers and also with your staff. It can get pretty busy, but cool atmosphere and awesome job !"
good,"Most shifts begin with a line of customers ready to be served. I provide support to my cashiers by cheerfully welcoming the next unattended guest. After writing their order on either a cup or pastry bag, I move on to the next guests. I repeat this routine until everyone has been helped. While the cashiers are still taking orders, I move on to the bar area to help the barista hand-craft each drink. I make two drinks at a time while the original barista maintains optimum customer connection. During any slow times everyone is supposed to focus on restocking and keeping everything cleaned up to health code standards. This is our daily routine even though the number of customers variates at all times. Working for this corporation has given me my greatest growing opportunities yet. Starbucks molded my customer service and management skills in a way that benefits my customers and my co-workers. I rarely have negative feedback from customers or managers, and I pride myself on the multitasking and time management skills that my managers have taught me. I am now able to think on the spot and find a solution that gives the customer exactly what they want without any unnecessary hassle. The management tries to guide their baristas to keep a clear knowledge of what is expected out of each shift. Of course the experience of the management ranges; therefore, there are many days that I have to adjust how I communicate with them so that I can stay ahead of my job while not interfering with my supervisor's management of the shift. Most of the time I have had co-workers that are very encouraging"
good,"Good team, nice work environment and friendly managers. I have got lot of good experience and I recommend to everyone who want a good and safe job."
good,"I enjoy going into work each day, knowing that what ever may happen, our team can always pull through. Its a great work environment that will help you grow to become your personal best. We work at a fast pace and do our best to exceed our customers expectations."
good,"A typical day would consist of cleaning, maintaining and keeping up with the equipment and materials needed. Working with a team in a fast paced environment and keeping the customer as the main priority."
good,"Starbucks was a great opportunity for me to expand my sales and management experience. I was able to learn about business and the way things work on the back end of things. I led my team to meet sales goals, and rose to the daily challenges that we encountered. The hardest part of this job was ensuring that the right person was stationed at the right places in the peak times. (We called it ""aces in their places""). As a shift supervisor I also had a little bit of trouble not wanting to step in and do things on my own. I learned to teach and not just do. The best part of my job was the daily interactions with customers and fellow employees."
good,It was a great place to work & learned a lot in my year & half. I had good co-workers who knew their job & skills we always had good laughs to make the day go by smooth. The management was good we all got along as team players and the hardest part was to see some of the great workers leave.
good,"As a Starbucks employee a day starts with looking at our target sales for the day and then proceed with the hand off information from the previous Shift. Sometimes things that are held through-out the day are carried on through the overnight shift but, most of them arent because of the drastic customer change."
good,"I clock in at 5:30 am and start preparing two pots of coffee, Pikes Place and Dark Roast of the day. I continue to set the pastry case in a presentable way that is eye catching to customers while following the schematic, and start making iced coffee along with iced teas. Shortly after I'll open at 6 am and assist customers with their needs in beverage making and suggesting pastries. "
good,It was awesome working here I enjoyed coming in everyday and working with the best team ever. It was like a family. People always were laughing and having fun
good,"Typical Day:"
good,Hard to start but once you get used to the flow the job becomes very easy. it's very fasted pace you'll severe hundreds of customers per day.The rushes very rarely will catch you by surprise. it can get boring form time to time. depending on who you work with the day could make you want to die or be the most fun ever
good,"A good place to work where you can work, enjoy, share your experience. Interact with customers."
good,"my favorite place to work. this company takes great care of its employees and its customers. even though i had a few bad experiences, i still give this company all credit due"
good,"Buen ambiente, buena capacitación, aprendes mucho acerca del café, estas en caja, manejas dinero por lo cual debes prestar mucha atención."
good,"Get to work at 4:30am, set everything up, make the coffee, put the order away, and chug a cup of coffee before you open to wake yourself up. Everyone had a different deployment station, I was usually on bar making drinks for everyone. I learned patience and I am now awesome at multitasking. Management was ok. She brought a lot of her personal problems to work and took it out on everyone. When she was in a good mood though she was great to work with. My co workers for the most part were fun to work with. A lot of them were hard workers but you have the occasional slacker who always shows up late and doesn't want to do anything. The hardest part was waking up super early in the morning and having an angry customer yell at you if we happen to be out of something or if he/she wasn't happy with their drink. The most enjoyable part of work though would probably be all the regulars that came in and the relationship you build with them."
good,Fast paced environment. You are able to grow in the company quickly.
good,"A typical day at work would be making drinks on bar, working in the drive-thru, working the front register, or cleaning and stocking items for the store and customers. Starbucks is normally busy and it gets tough trying to make all the drinks correct and in a decent time. The best part is meeting new people and making new friends."
good,"customer facing, fast pace and fun place to work at! opportunity to meat lots of nice people, flexible work patterns and nice staff discounts"
good,"Good place to work!!!. Lot of learning from this company, good experience in terms of setting up new store!!"
good,"Upon my long years of service at Starbucks coffee i was molded and developed to be a disciplined and well train leader and good follower aswell. some of the skills that i've learned whih i believe will be an asset and will be useful to my next job are the following"
good,the most enjoyable part was helping customers pick a new favorite drink or remember an old classic they love. fun and thriving work environment with great coworkers to help guide you during rush time.
good,"Working at Starbucks it is tiring at times, but you meet a lot of awesome people. You build bond with them, especially after memorizing there names. They give you raises every 6 month, you get paid weekly which is awesome. There's a lot of awesome perks."
good,"A typical day at work consists of either tending straight to a long line of customers or going through a long list of cleaning tasks during down time. Starbucks can be audited by Ecosure (health inspector) at any point in time, so it's important to always be on top of routine cleaning tasks and making sure that potential health code violations are always in check. It can be overwhelming learning how to make all the drinks on the menu as they are all very specific and some drinks have tricky rules. It can also be overwhelming dealing with customers when on register as they usually are not too kind when dealing when with new employees who either don't know their usual drink or don't know how to find it on the register (depending on the clientele, of course. Some people are more patient than others). While the pay would not be considered competitive, Starbucks offers crazy great benefits, which is why it's usually difficult for employees to quit. Starbucks also requires a minimum availability of 16 hours a week, and employees usually don't have a problem getting the amount of hours they need (when I started with Starbucks I requested full time and was working 30-35 hours a week almost immediately)"
good,It's been a long time since I have been at Starbucks..  They used to offer full time benefits for 20 hours a week.  Great for retirees or graduates.  I am not sure what the company offers now
good,"Good part-time job while in school!  very proactive environment, friendly coworkers and management (depending on the store). Hard work and great laughs."
good,"The job was a fun, fast paced work environment where I was able to learn a lot and use my knowledge to perfect my craft as a barista.  My only issue was the pay wage and I feel I deserve more for my quality of work."
good,"Work with and learn from people with different backgrounds. Everyday is different, never boring."
good,"Fun, exciting, execellent job for people who love to work with the public.  Great company to work for, execellent employee benefits. I would recommend the company to anyone."
good,"• Inventory and Purchasing of all Food and beverages for Outlets"
good,I am now more knowledgable about coffee and this job taught how to maintain a positive  attitude dispite whats going on.
good,"Starbucks is a great job to have if you're not financially independent. Getting past the training, the job becomes easier everyday. Customer service is truly an art of applied interpersonal skill in meeting their needs to the best of the company's ability, without treating them as mere transactions. Co-workers provide a relaxed and friendly environment as they are easy to connect with. The hardest part of the job is the disproportionate amount of responsibility that even a barista must manage, to the lack of compensation earned for it. The benefits are more than admirable, however, the Starbucks job is not nearly a living wage."
good,Fast-paced work really. It's crazy in the morning so everyone has a lot of stuff going on. We work as team and that's always how it is. We all get along too. It's pretty easy and I like it.
good,"Hard work, for not that great pay. Most the managers are young and horrible"
good,was working the front doing orders. and also I was clerk cleaning bathrooms and throwing out the trash
good,"I can show up to work a little early and order a free beverage of my choice. A typical workday involves constant interaction with customers and partners while taking orders and preparing delicious beverages all day and night."
good,Management treats employees well. Inviting work environment.
good,"Cleaning"
good,"it was a friendly dynamic staff who welcomes you with open arms very lexible hours and tips, clientele was many nut most were very kind"
good,"Can connect to people on a more personal level. Work days are usually fast thanks to the amount of customers coming in and out during a work shift. Great co-workers. Hardest part is getting your speed at a fast pace when there are a lot of customers,"
good,I truly loved working for this company. My co-workers were awesome and the customers were always grateful for their coffee.
good,I love working at Starbucks as my part time job currently. It is wonderful to have a place that I enjoy working at and going to on my time off as well.
good,Starbucks was great and should be better now with change in senior management.  The work life balance was fantastic and I enjoyed what I was doing.
good,"Just the energy of the place and work culture are impressive, dynamical. I wish there was more income stability for the average employee."
good,"The things I have learned: improving my management skills, and cash management."
good,fast fun friendly great health benefits Good for student...
good,"Store location and partners are key. Working in a high traffic location with lots of tourist mean little tips and more work than you know what to do with. Locations with lower traffic and more regulars is key to a happy experience. Also, have great partners by your side makes the load a lot easier to manage."
good,"The morning rush is the most challenging time, yet it is also the time with most opportunity for the store and the company as a whole. We strive to beat our personal customer count records. We work fast, yet make sure we are still friendly and attentive. "
good,"I enjoyed the workplace and the people, it is a great company to work for"
good,I was a shift supervisor there and I loved working with everyone there and I loved my customers. I opened and closed the store
good,Love our customers! I like that we have so many regulars. The team works very well together. Great management!
good,I usually spent my time cleaning the place and keeping the coffee stocked. It was hard but worth it. my co-workers were great and I felt safe around them. The hardest part though was the pace in the morning. It was peak time when several costumers came inside and through the drive through. It kept you on your toes but stress levels ran high for all due to people not showing up for their shift or under staffing.
good,"It's a wonderful job, with many benefits such as the recent college tuition programs they've put forth. Each day you get to meet another new person literally every two minutes. the days can be long at times but they go by fast when you get to utilize both taste smell and even weight/touch to make a perfect drink or food item for each and every customer that comes through your doors."
good,"Starbucks is great. The drive-through can be a bit rough, especially when it is constantly frequented like it was at the store I worked at. Getting along with your fellow workers is easy, there is definitely room for advancement, the benefits are really nice, and I had positive experiences with management."
good,"\hard working and fun coworkers "
good,"A typical day at work involved creating happiness, making a lot of beverages, and managing inventory. Most days are so different from one another that it is too difficult to draw comparisons without describing the job requirements themselves."
good,Everyone is part of a team and must work together to help make the customer's experience a good experience. You can't always avoid the stress but a positive attitude helps.
good,I loved working for Starbucks. It's a fun environment where you get to meet a lot of great people.
good,"i have learned a lot about time management, the value of knowing your product and how to handle difficult customers. threw my experiences i have gained a high level of respect for my managers as well as other coworkers. being able to rely on them when need be to gain knowledge and become a better employee. the hardest part of my job is also the most enjoyable part of my job, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction. making sure everything i do is appeasing them can be difficult but when the customer walks away happy i am happy"
good,it was fun. people are nice. enjoyed the customers and the coffee
good,"Great interaction with customers, great coffee culture and opportunity to learn about coffee."
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks included working on the tills, beverage creation and maintenance of café area. I learned the importance of communication within the team to complete duties to a high standard. My co workers promoted a fun and productive work environment by being friendly and also supportive. The hardest part of working at Starbucks was making sure that every beverage was created to standard and also managing challenging customers. The most enjoyable part of this job was my co workers as they were so supportive and I have made life long friends."
good,"Customer Service here is very important.  You never know what kind of day your customer is having and Starbucks wants to ensure it's always a good day.  Very pleasant experience compared to past ""Corporate"" like jobs."
good,"Nice place, but the management was not very good. It needed to be more organized."
good,•	Developed project plan for and complete EDI implementation for multiple service providers/ carriers for International Supply Chain group
good,"Starbucks is a great place to develop customer service skills as well as social skills. It has very flexible hours, and a lively atmosphere. A typical day at work involves cash and customer handling, making a variety of beverages, some dish washing and store cleanliness is involved throughout the day. I learned how to be in several places at once, as I worked in one of the busier locations at Metrotown. It was an exciting and energetic atmosphere. They have a very thorough training procedure and the staff are helpful and kind. Our manager was very laid back and considerate of employees personal lives. He trusts the staff with the well being of the store and was very understanding. The coworkers I had a Starbucks were some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of working with. They are very supportive, and offer coaching when needed. It has a very strong family vibe to it. The hardest part of working at the Metrotown location was the size of the facility, as it was very small and very busy. There were often not enough places to fit customers during our rushes. The raises could be better. They offer competitive wages, but start you at minimum wage, and you get a 10-16 cent raise once every six months. The most enjoyable part of Starbucks was definitely the working environment, very friendly, very social, very happy place to work. I also loved the flexibility with scheduling."
good,La relacion entre los trabajodres de esta institucion es muy buena ya que se genera lealtad hacia la empresa.
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with costumer service and interaction, learning quickly and adapting to any order or responsibility. I've learned a lot about how to deal with costumers of all sorts, manage my time for the duties that are needed to be done by the end of the night and cooperating with coworkers on every level. The hardest but most enjoyable part of the job is by far the customers. I enjoy interacting with them and making their day a little bit better with amazing service and good, quality product."
good,"Starbucks was pretty great environment, cool Co-worker. cool costumer"
good,"It was a good experience to work there. Fast paced environment,"
good,"It's a good place to work when you have a busy life trying to go to school or have other jobs.  On top of the flexibility, the company provides benefits."
good,"Very great atmosphere, very friendly people. the staff were very helpful. made you feel like you were part of a family."
good,"Developed a strong interpersonal skill set that includes problem-solving abilities, patience for others and conflict resolution through interactions with customers and colleagues"
good,Typical day at work was non stop busy and I loved it.  Time went by really fast the customer were nice usually we had regulars. Great experience.  I learned how to work with high volume work place at Starbucks and loved it every since.
good,"I learned a lot during this job, including layout, advertising and design skills."
good,"Typical day is a throw of a dice. Never know what you're going to get! Crazy hectic day with a line out the door for hours, or a mellow day in which you have time to do and delegate weekly and daily cleaning tasks to help the people that work next. Ive learned to multitask and manage a full crew- time management by sending people on breaks and doing tasks in an quick and efficient manner. Some management can really depict and defy how your day/week is going to be like. Good managers and shift leads know who is on the shift, know when and who needs to take breaks, is delegating tasks in an organized and thought out way. Ive learned great customer service skills and how to work well with other personality types in a small contained quarters when tensions can run high at times. It has taught me to keep a positive outlook and a smile on my face and treat each customer with the respect that they deserve. The most enjoyable part of my job is the incredible customers/ people we do get to meet and connect with on a personal level. Thus, essentially network through our customers."
good,A typical day was busy and highly stressful. I feel if Starbucks had a set guideline for managers to be able to promote would help tremendously. The hardest part of the job was I was still learning things about the products when I was promoted and it got highly stressful and not having the pay to compensate for that made it difficult.
good,"A great place to work, a lot of experience to be had with learning how to regulate product quality and customer service experience.  Opportunity to move up and manage shifts, but the pay is not really livable starting out.  It's possible to break your back and feel like your paycheck doesn't reflect the work you put in."
good,"I worked the coffee bar and cash register every day."
good,I enjoyed the job role a lot and wouldn't mind working for the company again. I became close with many of the workers and we would regularly socialise. The store would become extremely busy and we were very understaffed at the time so the shifts could become very stressful.
good,"*A typical day at work would be very busy."
good,"VERY FRIENDLY,patners...IT SO KIND "
good,"starbuck had to be my best job, co-workers went out the way to help me and other people get the job done."
good,I had to prepare diferent beverages following a standard recipe. I've learned that instructions are made for a reason  and that is very important to clean right before you finish the beverage.
good,"Loved the culture of the area, greatly enjoyed the diversity of patrons, and the management was the most reasonable I've ever dealt with."
good,"My time at Starbucks was spent working with a wide variety of people and interacting with a wide variety of customers. While our days often began at 5 am, the team you worked with made it worthwhile. Getting to know the regular customers was one of my favourite things, and often made dealing with the nasty customers easier. Morning rushes could often be stressful but with proper deployment and competent staff, flew by in a breeze, but those who are not accustomed to working in a fast paced environment will easily fall behind. "
good,Work is varied with many responsibilities needing to be accomplished within a day.
good,"Multi-tasking with customer orders, with maintaining consumer satisfaction."
good,"made drinks and prepped food for next day, cleaned station as well as around the sitting area."
good,"A typical day included making drinks, learning new drinks and cleaning up. I worked on a campus so our kiosk was small."
good,The location I worked at did not have very good management. Employees were often stuck working alone with long lines of angry customers.
good,"I really enjoy working for starbucks they are a great company to work for, they work with you with your school schedule, there is a raise every 6 months, get as many drinks as you want when you work, and also they give benefits for part time employees."
good,Productive -- fun work place.  Great place to learn new tasks.
good,"Most people are aware of Starbucks and have been to a location for a beverage of their choice. As a Barista working behind the counter it brings a sense of pride and terror. Pride because the moments when you are able to make somebody's day are very rewarding. Terror because it demands a lot of emotional and psychological strength and patience. On a daily basis you will be greeting and assisting anywhere from 100-500 different customers of various emotional states of mind. From the rushing office worker who's picking up their daily routine, to the family who is treating themselves, to the party planner who has a bulk order. You learn how to work as a team and expedite every aspect of a guests need while maintaining a clean store and adhering to various standards set and enforced by Starbucks. As a Barista, when directly assisting a customer you have to have a great memory, when at the cash register you must show composure while juggling entering their order into a cash register, writing the details of their beverage on a cup for another barista to prepare, and setting food aside to be handed out. On the drink preparation side you must remember the basic recipe's as well as the special rules for various drinks and recall and replicate them within 1 minute of receiving your order. Management varies very heavily from store to store and from area to area, you may have one manager who is an advocate in their community with various activities and promotes them in the workplace to co-workers, or one who is more business orientated and more focused on numbers. Your co-workers will also"
good,"It takes a while to remember the recipes for drinks, and it would be better if the manager told me beforehand when I was going to be tested on drinks. Also if the certification test was not during the busiest hours of the day it would be appreciated. I believe more leniency is shown towards full-time staff members from my own experience."
good,Great place to work. Tons of benefits. Tips. Okay people to work with. Okay manager. Okay customers. Just depends what store you work at. Every store is different.
good,"Typical day includes stocking up on ingredients, making drinks, and ensuring of store cleanliness."
good,"Absolutely loved working here. I enjoyed all of my coworkers and management, pay was decent, and had fun all while working."
good,I worked for the company from June 2011-April 2013 and left the company for a better job. A typical day includes making drinks and ringing up customers. Great place to network and meet some pretty interesting people. The company allows you to move up and encourages you to move up if they feel you are ready. Some customers may be a bit rude or demanding but that is the most case.
good,I loved working for this company till 2009 when the economy forced them to close over 600 locations and treat partners completely differently.
good,"a typical day at starbucks was busy yet productive"
good,"A typical day at work would consist of cash handling, meeting constant customer demands, scheduling breaks/meals, preparing a deposit, bank run."
good,A company that really sticks with the mission and vision. Learned the meaning of loyalty and management was my teaches. Co-workers started to be friends and the hardest part of the job is not to be sad on the job. The best memory is the wholeness of the company and each individual has its role and its recognize. Unfortunate is the low pay.
good,"Me relacionei bem com os outros funcionários "
good,"Great place, strong team work ethic, very high set standards. Most enjoyable part of the job was the diverse range of customers you served making sure that no 2 days were ever the same. Management very rarely office based, everyone did every job every day. My progression within the company enabled me to learn a great deal of transferable skills including Payroll, Recruitment, Merchandising, Promotions, Inventory Management and how to deal with challenging customer service situations."
good,"Extremely busy, but enjoyable place to work. Hard to progress from Supervisor to Manager. Culture of the business is great, and so is team and management."
good,"As a shift supervisor I was responsible for opening or closing a store, manage and lead my team during my shifts, provide high quality customer service, cooperate with my manager, coach and train new employees, handle cash, be a good example for my co-workers, manage and solve unpredictable or unpleasant situations both with customers and employees."
good,"A typical day would be very busy, fast past, and consistently doing something. I had very good co-works who were great team players, the hardest part of the job would be making sure drinks were prepared under 3 minutes while being short staffed."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company I acquired a really good work ethic while working for them not that I wasn't a hard worker before but I gained experience in many different ways. My days would start by brewing fresh coffee (obviously) putting pastries out, and opening my register. As the day continued I would be extremely busy a lot of the time but in a productive way.  Organized chaos is the best way to describe it. I was very skilled at making quality drinks in a extremely efficient time scale. I also dealt with a lot of customers and starbucks costumers at least at my store were very diverse I am a people person and with the skills in customer service I learned on the job I am unstoppable. Leaving for the day meant counting my register cleaning my areas and the lobby and stocking whatever I saw needed stocking. I liked this job but it became difficult to keep up with the pace when my schedule got larger and I was stretched very thin.  GREAT job for students though they work with your school schedule and still give you enough hours to get by."
good,"Starbucks was amazing besides the fact that I became addicted to coffee I enjoyed making customers smile. Management treated me well and I got along with my co-workers. I woke up every morning excited to go to work, being that it was at the airport I met so many people. The opportunity to make people happy just by making a drink or giving them a pastry made my day."
good,"Working hours are as follows during the week: Monday-Wednesday 6am-8pm, Thursday 6am-10pm, Saturday 7am-8pm, Sunday 8:30am-7pm."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is fast paced, friendly enviroment filled with learning and informing others with coffee knowledge. A typical day is super busy, if your not making connections with customers, you are working on projects within the store, making hand crafted beverages, working toward goals. "
good,"- Customize drinks"
good,"Excellent customer service training"
good,"Una empresa en la que hay buena comunicacion, posibilidades muy altas de promocion"
good,Being able to multi-task and create better beverage way to help create a faster pace to make enjoyable drinks. This job helped me being able to work under pressure and on a deadline.
good,keep the work place clean and sanitized while providing a great tasting beverage to all customers .
good,"Your work day starts early..... before daylight early.  You are tasked with making sure that everyone else in the world has a successful start to their day by making them the perfect cup of Java.  The customers are pleasant, and for the most part predictable."
good,"I worked all throughout the day during the week so I was accustomed to opening, morning, mid-day and closing routines. I enjoyed being a barista and above all else I loved the interaction with people I worked with and provided services to."
good,A typical day was fast paced. No one day was the same which was good to keep employees alert and on course. Management had goals and would strive for those goals. Coworkers would adhere to the system set in place. The hardest part of the job would be the peak periods in which the work floor would be very busy. The most enjoyable part of the job would be to know that you impacted the day of a person in a positive way by delivering great service.
good,"Starbucks is really big on providing partners with tools to build good customer service skills. Of course, every store is different depending on management and people, but overall the idea is the same - customer is always right."
good,"Em todos os meus dias de trabalhado encontrava vários tipos de pessoas, tanto como clientes e funcionários. Meu dia a dia era corrido porém muito produtivo, estabelecia metas, porque meu cargo de coordenadora exigia, posicionava todos os funcionários em meu plantão nos seus devidos lugares, ajudava todos os suas posições. E todos os dias, com base em meus antigos treinamentos, estabelecia também a cultura em si que a empresa STARBUCKS preza, sendo assim fazíamos um excelente ambiente de trabalho onde muita das vezes não parecia que ambos estávamos trabalhando e sim passando pros nossos clientes nossa cultura e nossa alegria."
good,"Working at Starbucks helped me develop a set of skills that can be applied in  nearly any work environment, including but not limited to customer service, efficiency, task delegation, inventory control, and money management."
good,I had a lot of fun working at starbucks. I learned a lot about myself and about working as a student. It helped me realize the value of money and how hard it is earned/easily spent. It was an amazing learning and growing experience. One I am sure never to forget.
good,"Everyday is filled with fun, productive and taskful day. The best part of the day is to cater and have personalized connections with customers. Everyday is anticipation, connection, personalizing and owning each experience witih customers and partners (co-workers). My co-workers are the most genuine, fun-friendly people you'll ever meet"
good,Barista build rapport with guest and have them coming back for more becoming regulars and soon they walk in the door you know what they are going to order and start to make the drink by time they at the cash register their drink is made.
good,"Great place to work, good management and great communication within company about promotions and store standards. Good benefits, even for part time work which is major draw, poor salaries."
good,"So lively and coworkers are all helpful and encouraging. Never a boring moment you multitask like crazy. Warm feeling when you walk inside, awesome manager."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the constant customer interaction. The store which I am at now is my fourth store. At each of the stores which I have worked at, I have gotten to know many of the regulars (incredibly amazing).  The things that you learn just simply from engaging with a customer, to cashing them out and providing them with that Starbucks experience is exceptional.  I have learned of good days, bad days, how the weather is outside and how my favorite sports teams are doing. The employees have a joy in helping customers have an unforgettable experience. Something so amazing such as coffee and brings so many people together.  It's truly the most remarkable part about my job."
good,I learned a great deal of how to make customized lattes and frappucinos for customers. It was very rewarding.
good,"Having been with Starbucks for a year, I can say that by far this is one of the most enjoyable jobs I have or will have.  Every day brings something new to the table, and the busy times are the most fun to handle."
good,"The work is great, the co-workers are wonderful and the management is fantastic. They pay could be better but if you don't have major bills to pay it's a great place."
good,"Starbucks is a perfect college job. It is very flexible and you can work whenever to fit whatever schedule you may have outside of work. It is a very fun job. Shift supervisors, assistant managers and store managers vary between stores but mine was very good. The district managers however, are evil. They are backstabbing and very two-faced."
good,"Starbucks is like any company, you can make it a place that is just a job, or a family. I chose to make it a family."
good,arrive to work station and begin brewing fresh coffee. assemble all bakery pastries and food take all guest orders as they arrive. end of the day clean and organize work area and stock and manage next day inventory.
good,Co-workers are great and friendly.  Great benefits and great management
good,Starbucks was a great learning experience. I love interacting with the customers as well as staff from our store and stores in surrounding areas. We always helped one another. There was always excitement as we pushed to provide excellent customer service.
good,"I loved working here meeting new people, being exposed to all different types of the products sold. Working here yoy are never bored. Your ability to remember all the drink combinations of loyal customers was also very fun. The company provides advancement opportunities."
good,"Starbucks, other wise known as ""We Proudly Serve"" was a great learning experience. This position was the first position I held at Johnson & Wales University which allowed me to appreciate the programs offered to us as students. I learned the proper methods, recipes, and equipment used to make the drinks as a barista and the importance of customer service that the company ""Starbucks"" is known for. The management were very reliable, hard-working examples but as a new chain we as a unit had to familiarize ourselves with each other, the rules, and the procedures expected. The hardest part of the job in fact was promoting and creating the best environment for customers to return as a new store, while learning and familiarizing ourselves with the requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the recipes and testing new drinks to offer as specials. This job allowed me to practice great customer service skills and to experience all that goes into creating and preparing the start-up of a new business and business plan."
good,"coming to work wasn't bad at all. Showing up for everyone to reach one common goal, which is to exceed the customer satisfaction everyday. along the way you'll obtain other skills such as time management, in which i feel as important in everyday life. Learning how to stay composed during frantic situations."
good,"A typical day consists of the following: ensuring the proper management of cash by inspecting and organizing the safe and registers, assigning partners to particular positions, delegating cleaning responsibilities, completing inventory counts necessary to maintain store products, and at all times helping the customer in as quick and friendly a manner as possible. First and foremost, Starbucks teaches you how to effectively multitask. While serving the customer is always primary, it's also necessary to simultaneously attend to cash management, allocate time for breaks and lunches, prepare beverage ingredients, complete cleaning tasks, and perform routine maintenance on machines and appliances. As is usually the case, managers can be either good or bad. Generally speaking, the former are the norm and the latter are quickly replaced. Managers typically go above and beyond to support their subordinates. More often than not, they work unpaid overtime to do so. Coworkers are one of the most enjoyable aspects of a career at Starbucks. Working collaboratively for long periods of time toward the same goals builds positive relationships and a rapport that oftentimes persists long after individuals cease working together. The most difficult aspect of being a supervisor at Starbucks is a policy that the company refers to as ""coaching in the moment."" It's an expectation that a supervisor should, upon noticing a problem, take the offending barista aside and correct the mistake or inappropriate behavior. It's an understandable policy, in that mistakes should be addressed promptly before they"
good,"I'd come to work and immediately be greeted by my co-workers and customers. I learned how to further my customer service skills, make the perfect beverages for different customers and conduct a successful business. My co-workers were the best to work with, they ensured it would be a productive and fun filled day everyday. The hardest part of my work day was definitely closing the store up, cleaning spills, setting up the morning crew for success and getting out at a reasonable time. My enjoyable part of my work day was working with a family oriented co-workers and interacting with the customers."
good,"while the environment can be fast-paced and problematic at times, your co-workers are usually there for you.  a good manager can make all the difference, and that is what i have."

good,"Working at Starbucks I learn something  new everyday. I've learn to become a wonderful leader. Stepping up to the plate isnt always bad, I connect with customers instantly, which is so wonder. Working with others is not always bad, it could be aggavating sometimes, but I always manage to keep a smile on my face. Being a manger isnt only about being in charge, its about leadership, honesty, and intelligence. I love everything about my job even my hard days, from my employees, to my customers. I love my job."
good,"Learning how to make the drinks standard was a bit challenging. Most of the customers were fine with knowing it was your first time! It was a lot of fun when a customer didn't know what they wanted and just let you make them something random. I had co-workers who were fantastic at just whipping up something fantastic."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job, and why I love the company, is the fact that I can talk to so many different people throughout the day. I would work with anywhere from 2 to 10 different people throughout the day and serve 600-800 people during my shift. I enjoyed being able to talk to them, as well as being able to put a smile on their face just by making them a fantastic drink."
good,worked hard made drinks had fun with the co-workers. My manager was awesome
good,I was morning supervisor and loved the job.  I had a great team to work with.  The job was very fast paced making the day just fly by.  There was always up to date training which you got paid for.  Probably the hardest part of my job was being in charge when there was conflict team partners.  I don't like conflict so I would have to have heart to heart talks with them individually which took me away from other areas of my responsibilities to solve the problem.  This would sometimes cause me to get behind on my own duties.  Over all we all had a great time with our job turning the job into a place of enjoyment amongst ourselves as well as our customers .
good,there is not much to say here i worked here to pay for bills and school. coffee shop is a coffee shop i excelled in customer service and work flow actually even had a nickname as a curry coffee master do to the fact of being indian and making great coffee

good,"A great company to work for. Whether your on bar, register, or drive through the work environment is fun ad fast paced."
good,"A typical day at work included traveling to one or more of my locations to meet with Starbucks Managers and their teams. The topics of the visits included Customer Service, Store Presentation, Sales/Profit performance, Professional Growth, Staffing and Preparing for upcoming promotions/directives.  What did I learn - you need to agree on what the end result looks like but allow your people to get there by making their own decisions and executing their own plan while still holding them accountable to the end result. "
good,Working at Starbucks is fun! I love my coworkers and I have made really great relationships with them and also with some of our customers. I love the fact that I can have benefits even if I am part time.. and we get other great perks.. not everyday is a great one.. but that is life itself.. overall a good company to work for
good,"I would come in usually about 5 minutes or so early, then I would ask whose the shift lead and ask him/her what they wanted me to do and where they wanted me for the day. They would usually put me on the register because I was new and I didn't really know how to make the beverages as fast as they did. So I would greet the customers as they walked, in took their orders and dispensed their cash. Besides being on the cash register and making the beverages we had to clean the restrooms, sweep, straighten up the lobby and take out the trash. What I learned by being a Starbucks barista is that you always have to be on your toes and ""challenge ready"" because rush hour can happen almost at any time and you have to prepare for it. Our management was encouraging and positive, but it had its flakes and negative times where there was a lot of favoritism with the manager and some of the baristas. My co workers some of them were helpful while some of them stayed in their own lane and didn't care too much about anyone else. The hardest part of the job was making and memorizing the drinks. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people the soft warm smiles and laughs, the people were the best part of the job for me helping one customer one cup at a time."

good,"There is nothing like the culture of a coffee shop. The fast paced, good attitude, near performance art is exhilarating and challenging. Being a shift supervisor and deciding where everyone should go and for how long to create a well-oiled machine of production yielding the highest return with the lowest amount of man-hours was engaging. The team that I worked with was positive and goal-driven. The hardest part was the early hours and really embodying a morning-person, regardless of how you feel that morning."
good,"good place to work to satisfy any customer, learn about the contract with starbucks , a good confidential with customers"
good,"A typical day at work is making drinks, parring tills, giving out break, answering the phone, and delegating task to workers, I learned to be patient, and listen carefully. my co workers are great people to work with we all try to brighten up each others day. the hardest part of my job is the downtime when its slow and theirs nothing to do but clean.

good,Starbucks was a place I developed my skills in speaking with people .  There was a lot of fun to be had enjoying the job and the customers who came in.  One of the goals of running a coffee shop is making sure the people who come leave more happy than they came.
good,A company that is very involved in community. Typical day is behind a desk reviewing reports and going over budgets.  I also was heavily involved in the supervision and consulting of new store construction and staffing.  I taught the Starbucks training classes to all new hires including upper management.  Learned how to be a servant leader to my staff.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work while in college. They will work with your schedule and give you as many or as few hours as you would like. The people are great to work.

I learned how to connect with the customers at the drive-thru while they are waiting for their drinks.  So my skills with customer service are very well developed."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work for Students who are looking for a job.
good,"Starbucks is hard but fun work, they offer great work incentives and are constantly motivating their employees. You leave each day with a good moral and sense of accomplishment."
good,"Starbucks is a different culture. Some say the product and the convenience is the reason for customers to come back. There's more to it. It's the baristas that customers come to see. With a friendly and welcoming face, customers know they will be taken care of. With a smaller staff on hand, they all get along and which shows to the customer. The best thing about the job was the precision and accuracy of the beverage while maintaining conversations with the customer. The hardest thing to look out for was a customer that is verbal about the wait when they come in during a rush. However the baristas were accommodating of the situation."
good,"Trabajar en una empresa de la magnitud de Starbucks fue una experiencia inolvidable, donde aprendi muchisimo y tengo muchos recduerdos"
good,"Legendary customer service, great benefits, free bean stock"
good,"A typical day would be either working bar or register. If you worked bar, you were in charge of every drink and if you worked register you worked that and the coffee machine and the pastries. I learned people are very outgoing and super nice! My managers were good, i had at least 5 different ones. The hardest part of my job would of been when it got super crazy in there I was stressed out in the beginning but then I got use to it. The most enjoyable part of my job was everything, i never had a problem with Starbucks Company. "
good,"Starbucks really is a fantastic company to work for. They really do all they can do take care of you. Being the health coverage, CUP fund 401k, stock grants, discounts etc. The salary for management and the hourly wage doesn't equal the work load."
good,Our days varied everyday at Starbucks. On some days it was slow and on other days it was busy. I learned the value of having a positive work environment with people that support you. I learned that that is what makes a good management team and also good co-workers. The hardest part of the job staying focused on busy days. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to meet new people everyday. 
good,It is very fast paced and busy but with loyal customers and employees
good,"fun, fast passed, good benefits, great coffee. Learned about leading a team, producing orders, loss and profit. Partner relationships are great!! Have met some really awesome people working here. Overall I love it, it has its ups and downs but dont they all? If you like interacting with people this is the job for you. "
good,"Worked at Starbucks for 3 years, and it doesn't require anything out of the ordinary. When I 1st began, I knew nothing of coffee outside of that people drink it a lot in the morning. But, there was more to it than just coffee as I knew how to make some of the best beverages you ever had. I made a ton of new friends (co-workers and customers alike). The job had stock you can invest in as well as a 401k plan, and that alone had me working there for a good while. Wanted to stay and obtain a management position, but I couldn't find a store to transfer into while I was moving; and if anyone who works at any Starbucks didn't clock into the system, the system would automatically fire you (not sure why they had it set up that way). So, overall, it's a great place company to work at, and the benefits are very well worth it.   "
good,"good company,but im not satisfied for my salary b""coz,my family will become big"
good,"ive been working here for 3 years its was great at first,but when it gets busy everybody keep calling off at work so we end up getting short of people but in my experience its a bad management alot of people complain they cant quit coz theres only a few jobs out there so you know so far it was great...i love it,i love evrybody.meeting new poeple at the airports its a good learning experience!"

good,"A typical day at this company would include working in a fast pace environment and assisting customers by selecting the best products for them.  I enjoyed putting together custom drink orders and providing them with a perfectly constructed beverage.  Working for Starbucks helps strengthen your multi-tasking skills as you are constantly given more than one thing to do at one time.  My co-workers, supervisor and manager are still good friends of mine because I worked hard for and with them during every shift."
good,"Typical days at work are fast-paced and fun. You get to interact with a lot of different people and learn time management and multi-tasking skills.

Sometimes I restocked. Assisted with opening and closing duties. Washed dishes, etc. I learned how to make new food and beverages. I worked with a variety of different types of people. Learned flexibility. The management was great and I can't say a single bad thing about them. Great training and communication skills. Excellent positive reinforcement. My coworkers were very nice and fun to work with. The hardest part is the speed in which things needed to be done. The most enjoyable part was helping people and working as a team with my coworkers. "

good,I analyze reports to forecast needs for staffing to meet business needs. I learned how to be a leader. I learned how your seen plays a big part of how your store runs and the buy in you will get from your team. I learned the most from this job by far of all the positions to this point. My mentors were the hands on type managers that I really identified with which made it easy to learn. Co-worker accepted me with open arms being a small close knit squad. The hardest was the decision to step down from my position but building a future with a new family was a need I had to make. Excellent customer service was the most enjoyable with the fast paced enviroment

good,"I began my shift at Starbucks by opening the facility and bringing out all the food to store in the display for customers daily intake. I then was responsible for obtaining ingredients for the drinks and coffee as well as opening up my register. My day went on by preparing food and drinks for the morning rush customers and the ones whom just simply loved Starbucks. I learned how to prepare good satisfactory drinks in a timely fashion, but also how to memorize and listen to a customer in order to make the perfect drink. My co-workers were very helpful to me during my time at starbucks, they taught me easy ways to memorize ingredients and ways to handle the drive-thru orders and the in-store customers. The hardest part of my job was standing up for 9 hours at a time. I was young and it wasnt something that I was used to, especially from 5 am. The most enjoyable part was simply seeing the customers satisfied or when they told my manager good reviews about services."
good,Customer service. Handling food. Greeting and helping customers. Constant cleaning and prepping for next customer. Fast and efficient work environment.

good,"After getting through security and taking the train to the concourse in which my Srarbucks is located, I jump right into my position of Barista since there is always a steady stream of customers. I have learned to become very patient, well focused and manage to keep quality up to its highest standards. My co workers make my job very interesting with all their different personalities, were always smiling and keep each other in a good mood. The hardest part of the job is usually when flights are delayed or canceled and passengers come to us to solve there problems other than their need for coffee. We cant always help them as much as we would like to and them become very upset, we've learned to get used to that and keep it from causing a loss of courtesy towards others."
good,"Its no wonder why Starbucks was voted one of the best places to work, because its true! The culture, the values, the education, the inspiration, the management, their coffee! Its a beautiful thing to have to work there. I don't believe there has been a bad experience there.

Ive learned a lot about being a leader from working here also about how to connect with the people I work with more , and the customers as well.

good,"Being a people person is the most important part of this job. Its 90% of what we do, interact and help customers. My personality fit well with this company and they were very flexible with my school schedule."
good,"A typical day would begin at 5am with the anticipating customers waiting for the store to open at 5:30pm. Great customer service goes far and beyond the call of duty, getting one's morning off to a great start, setting up for an after meeting with the aroma of coffee and a variety of delicous pastries for an outside business. In the aspect of managing were reaping the benefits of turning a great profit along with meeting the expectation(s) of our customers on a daily base. Employees properly trained to meet the needs of our customers, upsell and just being happy and friendly. I would say that the hardiest part is during our peak times, not being able to give that one on one service to our regular customers. Most enjoyable was just meeting new people on any given day, turning something negative into a positive situation and having a smooth enjoyable day."
good,"A typical day would be smiling and greeting customers, I learned how to handle cash in register and make drinks hot and cold. The management was fair co workers were helpful. The hardest part was not making drink how customers want it. the most enjoyable part is seeing the customer smile because drink is good."

good,"I personally loved working for this company, because I am very good at customer service. Also, I am a stickler for following rules, so I was highly appreciated. However, not all managers treat their partners fairly. Also, if you are called in for work on your day off and you say ""no"" they may hold that against you. The benefits are good though and it is a very fun environment to work in."
good,"Starbucks core values are aligned with my values. I've been loyal to the company for ten years because of the amazing daily customer and employee connections. I fully appreciate and utilize the benefits package offered to the employees. The hardest part of the job is loving the company and customers, but not being able to move up into an accounting position in Wisconsin."

good,"I prepared beverages for customer, open/close store, cash control and making sure everything is ready for next day open."
good,"Work is fast-paced and atmosphere is fun. Exciting workplace because of up beat partners. Hardest part of the job is keeping up with sales. Partners help with sales if goals are not met. Sbux is very team oriented. Everybody works as a team and serves one goal, which is to satisfy customers needs."
good,"i really did enjoy my time here, too bad i got fired because i wanted to go back to school. but other than that, nice co workers, breaks were nice, and you get all the free drinks you can drink, whats not to like about this job? just wish i can get rehired in this new state now."

There was always something fun happening or to do within the job that made things fun to work there. Starbucks taught me how to be more patient,more calm and has helped me to enhance my customer service skills. The management and partners were very family oreinted most of the time and with that, work was very happy and fun to go to. The hardest part of the job was working with partners that were not team oriented, and the most enjoyable was when everyone worked as a team to help our customers have excellent customer service, which was 98 percent of the time."
good,a typical day was for the most part busy because i worked in an airport i learned a lot of new way to make different kinds of drinks the management were nice and my coworkers were patience with teaching me the ropes the hardest part was moving fast when i was a new comer i liked the new people everyday
good,"starbucks is a great franchised company to work for. especially for students who need pt time work. the most enjoyable part of this job was meeting smiling faces everyday from all walks of life, preparing drinks and learning new things along the way."

good,"Daily figures, rota adjustment, deployment, ordering, staff training and recruitment, serving customers, merchandising."
good,I have been with the company on and off for 5 years. Starbucks has supported me not only with bills but also during my college years. I gained so of the best friends I know I will have for life and I discover my love for the beverage industry. When I was under my favorite manager opportunity for advancement was only a question away. This job has become second nature to me so much until I still have to remind my self to stop using we when I am describing the company to people.
good,I started at Starbucks at 18 years old. Moved into a leadership position fairly quickly and enjoyed working here. Provided me with leadership skills I still utilize in my current role.
good,"Working at starbucks was AMAZING. I learned so much about coffee it was insane. The company awarded us with STOCK for christmas!! And also have excellent incentives just for working there.

good,My days consisted of basic barista responsibilities and learning more customer service skills.
good,While the company is very employee orientated and the benefits are really good. A high turnover is sometimes hard for morale.
good,"A typical day at work starts off very early for me. The majority of the shifts I do are opening shifts. The day usually moves at a very fast pace. You're on your feet all day, and help customers in anyway that they need. I have learned to think on my feet, to keep a calm cool demeanor in hectic events. Also, I've learned to manage my time in a productive way, and have also learned how to manage cash within the proper security procedures. I've also learned how to talk to customers and staff in a productive way. The hardest part of my job would have to be getting up early, and keeping a high energy level through out the day. The most enjoyable part of my day is talking and connecting with customers. Customer service is very important in Starbucks, and I absolutely love to help my customers and make their day the best day."

Whether you're a student, a mom, or a fledgling entrepreneur, as long as you have high energy, customer service skills, and a willingness to learn you will enjoy working here and reap many benefits from it. Your duties include making coffee and specialty drinks, serving customers, taking orders, organizing and stocking product, and cleaning the store. You work in a team of 2-5 people and your job varies greatly depending on which day part you work. There is room for career advancement, and it it possible to have your own store within 5 years of your hire date. As a corporation they are very respectful of their employees (they call them ""partners"") and allow up to three breaks in an 8 hour workday."
good,Starbucks has been the best job I have ever had. I enjoyed working with a large variety of cultures and teaching many people about coffee and Starbucks values. Every day was a different surprise. The hardest part of the job was when so many stores closed and moral within the company dropped. The best part of working for Starbucks was that you always felt that the company would stand by you. I would recommend working for Starbucks to anyone!
good,"i was a barista and i got to make interesting drinks, dealing with customers and handing food and drinks."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place to learn basic work skills. Each employee is endowed with the seeds of passion for our handcrafted products. The managers are great, understanding, and very compensating; my fellow partners are quite the same. Working as a Barista is not hard at all, as long as one is willing to sustain consistency throughout the products and the relationship with the customers. Being able to maintain a high level of excellence over the years I have worked at Starbucks helps me to feel accomplishment for my work, and the management has always reminded me of their gratitude for this."
good,"Made drinks for customers, rang up customers. Stalking new product on the floor, mopping and cleaning store before customers come in."
good,"Starbucks is a GREAT company to work for. Well managed, organized, co-workers are great, and there is room for movement in the company."
good,"Throughout my 3+ year tenure at Starbucks, I have seen and experienced great growth and collapse. Each step was thoughtfully processed and meticulously analyzed before being implemented. This is a solutions company that will find answers from Baristas and customers alike. In terms of the collapse, it was during the economic crash of 2009 but Starbucks has bounced back and shines once again."
good,"In a typical day, I stayed busy and interacted with many customers. I learned how to perfectly craft espresso and frozen beverages as well and management and cash handling skills. I enjoyed most of the people that I worked with but at times I did not feel that I had competent managers. The hardest part of my job was the hours that I worked. Some days I worked at 4 in the morning and other days I worked until 11 at night. I did enjoy the fast paced environment because if I'm staying busy I'm more focused and the time goes by quicker."
good,"This was a very fast paced work place. I had a lot of fun at times, while most others were stressful. I learned about inventory forecasts, and the science behind espresso and coffee beverages. A hard part about this job was keeping customer morals high while at time beverages would take longer during peak hours. I am a people person, and I loved meeting new customers, even the one's just traveling through town on the I-10."
good,"Makeing coffee all day seems like a boring job, but it was actually very fun. Some of the customers request you to make there drink, it can be very validating."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. Working with the right people can heighten the experience. Those who uphold the company values make the workplace everything Howard Schulz would want it to be!
good,"The job itself is easy to learn, friendly managers & co-workers that are always willing to help you. A lot of opportunity to improve your skills & advance in the company."
good,They notice potential in people and in my case they advanced me pretty quickly.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday. You are really able to connect with the customers that come in and the people you work with truly become your family.
good,"Desarrollo en administracion, coordinacion, manejo de personal, recursos humanos, logistica."
good,"Great opportunities for advancement, weekly tips and fun co-workers."
good,"my review for starbucks is a great one-they are thriving in a cut-throat economy!great to work at at any age-flexible schedules-pays and treats all ""partners"" well with benefits for full time and part time employees. retirement plans and stock options.Also very easy to transfer to any other sbux in the world!Ideal for someone who likes to meet new people and wants to relocate."
good,"Loved working at starbucks, always able to put a smile on customers faces, Getting to know people from all over the states. Learning where a certain coffee bean comes from, and smelling new aromas"
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks, because I met a lot of new people and the company allowed me to be myself."
good,"Working as a Barista, you will gain useful experience in multi-tasking in a fast-paced environment and dealing with diligent clients."
good,I learned and gained the most skills working for this company.
good,A typical day of work involves providing customers with legendary service which includes quality beverages as well as connecting with the customers. The co-workers are great and have shown me just how important it is to be able to work together as a team while performing your individual job to the fullest. The hardest part of this job would keeping the speed of service within the time limit during a busy period while still preparing quality beverages. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fast paced environment.
good,Starbucks is a great job if you have other priorities but not if you are looking to move up in a company. They work well with school schedules and second jobs. Poor training in the beginning so be prepared to train yourself. Very high turn over rate but I have yet to see why because the management is fun loving.
good,"If you love drinking coffee then Starbucks is a really great place to work at. This company will give you great benefits even if your a part time. Most of the people I worked with ended up being my closest best friends. The store managers Ive had so far were more than amazing. Not only were they making sure I'm meeting company standards but also were able to show that they care about their employees. I'm lucky to have great managers that I can look up to. In this company, you learn alot about coffee and customer service. How to make it and what ingredients you can substitute it for when a customer wants a low-calorie drink. Because of starbucks, I now drink coffee everyday."
good,I was at Starbucks for 8 years. I've learned a lot about myself and working with others. Room for growth and the work/life balance were my only issues.
good,the hardest part of the job is knowing how to mix all the drinks but they become relatively easy within your first few days on the job
good,Starbucks has been a great company for working through college as they have flexible hours while still being able to provide their employees with benefits.
good,"Fun, trendy, well-read yuppy crowd and friendly diverse staff."
good,Starbucks as a company is very driven on making their customers feel welcome in their stores and the same goes for their employees. For the most part they make new hires and transfers alike on the store level feel very welcome and give them warm greetings as they begin their time with the company. There are always things that the company could do to make things better for employees but every company has that.
good,"The company has it's perks and downfalls. Each Starbucks has it's tier of employees; Manager, Assistant Manager, Shift Supervisors, Trainers and Barista. The work is quite hard and demanding but the people without a doubt are wonderful. Starbucks has great benefits and does have growth opportunities"
good,"Starbucks has been my favorite and best employer to date. I have made lifelong friends from both customers and co-workers, and was able to take great pride in my work and my store wherever I went. It isn't for everyone, and at the store level the pay will only take you so far, but the experience will follow you wherever you go after."
good,"Starbucks is the best thing that a college student can do. I got to learn customer service skills, drink good coffee, and make good friends. 4 years of work while completing my degree well spent."
good,Excellent benefits for part time and full time employees. A social environment while providing customer service.
good,"Starbucks Coffee Company is a company that has established itself as a leading retailer in a short amount of time. Over the last thirty years, it has spread its coffee culture from its Pacific Northwest roots. It has redefined legendary customer service and set the bar for food and beverage experience should be."
good,"Starbucks definitely takes care of its employees with many benefits. Work can be stressful when busy, especially having a drive thru and having to deal with difficult customers."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. Offering good starting pay, free Spotify, Gold Card, Pound of Coffee a week, and drinks while working, you can't beat it. I'd recommend this as a great place for anyone who is just starting out in the workplace. I would doubt the ability to move up, particularly past a shift lead or assistant manager, and at that point you're still probably not making enough to take care of yourself on your own, but I suppose it depends on where you live and how costly your lifestyle is. Overall, it was a great experience for me."
good,It’s little hectic but overall fun if you have good team. I like my manager and the spirit is sooo high which is very big deal at this kind of job. It can be tough but you can survive.
good,"Everything at Starbucks was great for the most part, pay was an issue the problems that occur aren’t worth the pay, and advancement is tough. Instead of raises “benefits” are given instead of a base pay increase which makes work feel not very rewarding"
good,"Un lugar muy agradable, conformado por un gran equipo de trabajo."
good,"All of my coworkers were friendly and we worked together to ensure great service to all of our customers. The job can get very fast-paced and stressful during drive through rushes, but the shift goes by fast when you're working hard. I would definitely recommend working at Starbucks!"
good,"The store I work at is great. I've been there for a few years and I can work the schedule I need to to balance my life at home and with school. The benefits are worthwhile, you don't have to work full-time to acquire them. The partners I work with are respectable and easy to get along with. I think the only down side of working here is that it's hard to move up, even when you show interest and have the skills to be in a better position."
good,"You must work as a team in order to meet the needs of the customers and be able to multi-tasks and provide customer service at a fast pace."
good,Working for this company open your eyes too many different people and walks of life. You work with a diverse group of people that allows one to learn something new!
good,"I had just 13 hours peer week so I decided to quit. But I really learned and the environment was super nice, also my manager is a sweet person, If I was with more hours I stay for sure."
good,"I love my job and my coworkers. Everything is organized, I never have to question what I’m doing or when my break is. The pay sucks and should be better since we do a lot of work and make customer connections."
good,Over all good culture at the company most people are happy there. So many locations you can find shifts that you like as some are even open 24 hours.  Management can still vary a lot by location.
good,"This job helps develop a lot of skills like multitasking, good communication, and teamwork. It concentrates heavily on customer experience. It has really helped me in talking to people and working out issues. It has also taught me how to work well under high pressure. Peaks and rushes can be very stressful and hard on the mind but you learn to cope. The environment is also very friendly and you make lifelong friends"
good,"A day in the life of a barista is pretty typical. You make coffee, spill coffee, grind coffee but most importantly you get to connect with your team and customers."
good,"Being a barista at Starbucks is a very enjoyable and fun job. Of all the ""first jobs"" available, this is one of the best without a doubt. Of course, it's no career. Eventually you will want to be paid a living wage and likely will want evenings and weekends off. This is a great place to stay while you're finishing your schooling and planning your next steps"
good,"Work days for Starbucks typically start with wherever your supervisor places you, whether that be to clean, make drinks, or take care of the drive thru. I learned plenty of social skills and met all kinds of people from every type of background with this job. Hardest part of this job was really during morning rushes, these peak times made it so that everyone was set in their position until the rush ended."
good,"I enjoyed working part time for starbucks, the schedule worked with my other job and allowed work/life balance. Fun extra benefits like free spotify, a lb of coffee a week, fun coworkers......"
good,"Starbucks is a chain first and foremost, a fast food for coffee, be prepared for a fast working environment."
good,"This was one of my first jobs and it created a strong work ethic within me. It taught me how to be more outgoing and less timid than I used to me. In a typical workday, I worked at the register, taking orders, completing orders to the satisfaction of customers and cleaning and prepping for the next day. It has such a great environment, it is very friendly and teaches you to better your communication skills. The hardest part is when customers are rude but I know how to keep my cool and not react in an inappropriate way."
good,"If you want to learn how to multi-task this is a job this will have you doing so. You will feel flustered at first but no one is expecting the world of you, or at least they shouldnt be."
good,"A tougher job than it looks because sometimes people are extraordinarily difficult, but it's a really stable, solid job with great compensation. room to move up if you prove you care and are willing to put in the effort. (I never moved up personally but the option was there)."
good,Great company to work for with a lot of amazing benefits. It's a really fun and inclusive work environment. The hardest part of the job is probably the training for new partners.
good,"It was a nice place to work. Was very flexible with my personal schedule, including schooling. It could get stressful at time but other coworkers we always so helpful and willing to support each other whenever."
good,"Fast-paced, stressful, but fun atmosphere to work in. Good pay, decent benefits, decent hours. Very inclusive. High turnover rate, but opportunities to keep learning or growing with the company. Overall, a good job and place to work."
good,"I learned how to put away orders at our store every Friday morning organizing and restocking the oldest to newest. "
good,"I worked with a young group of people, mostly my age (21 at the time). Got along with everyone and enjoyed the fast-paced lifestyle of a Starbucks mall kiosk."
good,"By nature of the product being sold, the demand for attentiveness and working knowledge of store procedures are crucial for success. The high volume of customers and personalities can lend itself to a degree of social stress, but with the right crew and penchant for working hard, it can be easy to have fun."
good,"It's easy, pays decent, very fun, very fast paced, makes you use problem solving. Most of the time there's LOADS of opportunity for advancement. But everything differs for location. I worked in 15 different locations and not a single one ran the same."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for and I’ve loved it for 15 years. If you’re not willing to relocate you will have trouble moving up within the company. Benefits are amazing and 401k/stock is above the rest. The fulfillment you will get depends on you and how you shape your environment for your employees and customers. Have to be very efficient at multitasking and wearing several different ‘hats’z
good,"I worked for the company for 4 years, and while I loved it when I first started I felt that during my last 2 years Starbucks changed their values and became money hungry. I gained the best friends working for starbucks both coworkers and customers, but for the amount of work and the lack of employees and support it was too much for my mental health. Starbucks has great benefits, but I couldn't see myself going back."
good,"Great company to work for, flexible hours and schedules, opportunities for learning and advancement, great benefits, opportunities to connect with coworkers and customers"
good,"Lost of fun working there. Always something to keep you busy during the day whether it was customers, or keeping up on cleaning tasks, or coffee tastings."
good,Enjoyed the fast pace environment and casual conversations and relationships that developed with regulars. I took away a lot from this job. I learned how to manage my time efficiently and in a timely manner and how to work under pressure.
good,Was a barista at Starbucks for two years and have nothing but good things to say about this work environment that Starbucks creates. I loved the regulars and the learning experiences when I worked here. Very fast paced but makes the time fly on your shifts! Very nice people and flexible!
good,"INteresting place to work, certainly not like my other jobs. Managers can be strict but they care about the Partners' well-being and always want feedback. A good place to work part-time and while you're in school. Generally very good at respecting hours."
good,"Distarbucks saya mempunyai banyak pengalaman yg menyenangkan disini saya belajar membuat minuman,conversation dengan customer,menawarkan makanan dan minuman serta saya belajar pengetahuan tentang kopi dan saya senang dengan itu"
good,"Had a blast working for Starbucks.  Was there for over a decade and regardless of the role, managing is a reflection of what you put into it.  Balance is possible but takes time, and depending on company direction you may be working more.  Great people, great benefits, fun atmosphere, and of course amazing coffee!"
good,"Starbucks is a great entry level job. Perfect for a side hustle as well! They treat their partners well, opportunities for growth and education with the company."
good,Working at Starbucks can be quite hard sometimes. It has affected my mental health a lot because the customers aren't the greatest there. I would recommend not working at Starbucks that is in a mall because its a lot to deal with sometimes. Otherwise its a good place for a first job.
good,Great place to work and a great place to learn and to be quick and hustle and surround yourself by many people. Great exposure to customer connecting.
good,"Starbucks works well with PT and FT employees, there's always opportunity to grow, amazing people to work with, never a dull moment, great benefits (including free coffee while working!). The atmosphere will change depending on the store you're working for, but all-in-all, it's a fairly consistent and structured place to work."
good,"Great as a college student because they have a flexible schedule. Management and team is what makes it or break it though. It’s not hard labor, drinks are fun. Lots of benefits."
good,Working as a supervisor gave me the chance to work with each partner one on one and that really enhanced the work environment. It is face passed environment but the most enjoyable time to pass!
good,Starbucks was a really positive first job for me. The training is easy to comprehend and the leads/management does a good job to check in and not move you along too quickly.
good,"You need to learn quickly to be successful. Typical work day requires doing tasks assigned by management as well as, assisting customers as they come into the store"
good,"I absolutely love working for this company. So much so that once I'm done with my degree, I've thought about working in the corporate world to stay with Starbucks. The environment is very inclusive and the hours are very flexible to accommodate a person's outside life (school/other jobs) but the pay could be a whole lot better for extremely high volume stores, which includes my current store. Other than that, it's wonderful and I look forward to work everyday."
good,Overall this was a great first job. Diverse and exciting place to be in most days. One of the biggest let downs was the pay. In todays society when you have places like McDonalds paying employees $10 an hours I honestly believe Starbucks should step it up and offer a better base Pay. Other than that the only thing sour about my time with Starbucks was Upper management (District Manager).
good,Comfortable workplace while always being on the move to complete tasks. Fast paced environment to create an efficient workplace for partners and customers needs are satisfied.
good,"There is a good work culture here. My co-workers and management are really understanding. Although, you must be able to work in a fast paced environment."
good,"J'ai eu la chance de découvrir le monde de la ""restauration rapide"" qui m'a permis de développer certaines compétences telles que l'organisation et la rigueur. J'ai pu expérimenté le travail sous pression et savoir comment le gérer. Starbucks est un environnement de travail convivial, où l'entraide prime. Cependant il faut savoir gérer l'intensité de travail lorsqu'il y a un grand nombre de client... Ce qui n'est pas toujours facile."
good,"The company changed a lot during my employment. I had a positive experience and worked with a lot of great employees and customers. However, by the end of my employment it was harder and harder to fulfill the customer connection protocol due to cut-backs in shift hours. This led to the feeling of always being understaffed and yet more and more busy."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, they offer great benefits and a flexible schedule along with a fun and engaging work atmosphere as long as you have the right management/team. The salary is nothing special but the other characteristics listed above are what make it a great work environment."
good,"Overall this a great company to build and establish your work experience with customer service, inventory management, cash handling, and beverage craftsmanship."
good,I enjoy coming into work and talking with my coworkers. I love being able to voice my questions and have it not returned with criticism. My partners at work are what make this job amazing. Also being able to connect with customers and having that bond created with just a cup of coffee is great!
good,"Working at Starbucks was hectic. There were many customers, and they are not always nice. It was fun at times, though. There were a lot of nice people to work with, and some of the regular customers were really great. It mostly depended on the day that you and others were having, but it was fun most of the time."
good,"Some days I am happy coming to work and other days I hate coming in to work. My employees can be stressful, there is always a problem with them. My manager sometimes add extra to my workload and I hate it."
good,"its a very nice place to work, best management and nice co workers and i love the diversity in starbucks i was even given shares or stocks , and they make you comfortable"
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun and hard. It's all about the culture and the experience, I made many of my current friends through work. Management is tough, I think they could work on that. Lots of small goals they give a supervisor overtake the main goals."
good,"Starbucks is a great employer with benefits offered even for part-time employees. The work is fast-paced, yet allows you to connect with coworkers and customers."
good,My experience has been mostly good and I’m a patient person which is a big reason why. I love my coworkers and a lot of regulars that come in. The management is a little skewed but overall I have a good relationship with my managers.
good,I find all the coworkers are great people and the managers are great. Every day always bring something new to the table when it comes to my learning skills weather that will be what a certain customer would want .
good,Aprendí mucho sobre la cultura de Starbucks alrededor del mundo y de la experiencia que tratan de brindar a sus clientes.
good,It’s a good job overall. Has really good benefits. Very flexible schedule. You have room for growth in the company. This job gives you the opportunity to gain great teamwork skills.
good,Everyone I worked with was always so fun and energetic. It was refreshing to go to work each shift and be able to learn from each other. I think the schedules could've been released a bit more in advance but other than that I loved working there
good,I loved working at Starbucks! It was the best job I have ever had and would love to go back. At the time of my employment I don't believe the new manager cared about his employees (he has since been let go) as he wrote me up for attending a funeral I gave notice for and then proceeded to cut my hours. The shift leads were always understanding and willing to help me grow as a barista and a person and that was awesome! Being able to connect with people of day-to-day basis was cool because soon I  had regulars of my own who asked for me.
good,Working for Starbucks was a learning experience. It was an awesome place that offers plenty of room for growth and individuality. I loved working at Starbucks and would recommend it to anybody.
good,"Starbucks is a awesome place to work for, if you're looking for a career in the coffee industry. Its a great job for a high school and/or college student. You can advance quickly if you want to. "
good,Great place to work overall and the company itself is amazing. However some managers do not know how to speak to employees in private and in front of costumers.
good,"I learned to manage mine and others' time, the hardest part of my job was the same that I ended up enjoying most: "" making beberages"" , it was hard at the beginning. the I got my certification as a barista trainer, as well as shift manager. I learned a lot about process improvement and quality assurance."
good,"I quit this job because I have a hard time working with employees who do not respect me, and treat me like I don't care about my job. I also just don't like working with employees who are rude for no reason."
good,"Environment can be fast paced and requires flexibility and good work ethic. Good customer service skills required. My coworkers are pretty great overall, definitely has a family feel. The pay isn't great, but tips help balance it out. Benefits are also provided for 20+ hours/week."
good,I got to work with hilarious and hard-working people. They cared about their customers and made sure I had the information to complete my tasks. They helped me address certain situations along with achievements. The staff made the store. I miss them!
good,"My time at Starbucks was some of the best of my life. With that being said, not many others can agree. It really depends on which store you work at. Managers can make or break a store. Mine was very customer oriented and our manager would choose partners based off of their personality and interests as well as their work. We were all a family there. I still talk with most of them to this day! Some advice I can give would be to go to a store and talk to the baristas. If you really hit it off, go ahead and apply! A lot of baristas are very transparent with what the job entails. I hope this helps!"
good,"This is a great company to work for, with its welcoming and fast paced environment. The employees are supportive and encouraging. I have learned about team work and team building, which has been a huge part of my success with the store I work in."
good,"I really enjoyed my time here. interacting with the customers was great, especially the ones that came in all the time. The company emphasizes customer connection, so it is important to provide good customer service."
good,The day would typically start very early and it would be fast paced and you would need do a lot of things quickly so the customers were taken care and had an enjoyable time while they were here. I would say the hardest part of the job was trying to do so many tasks at once. The most enjoyable part of the job definitely be the skills I've learned and how I've grown as a person.
good,"diverse teams, fast-paced environment, focus on personal growth as well as company growth.  The company pays well and provides amazing benefits for full and part time staff."
good,You get to work with really great people and work can be really fun. You get your good and bad customers like any other place. Benefits are pretty awesome. Only downfall is how terribly bad they are with dealing any complaints about their management staff. They will always side with management regardless if the rest of the team is reporting similar complaints. Go figure.
good,"if you love customer relations and connections and also enjoy a fast paced work environment, this is a good job. There's opportunities for growth, salary's OK and the benefits are great."
good,"Great staff that really make you enjoy working! Very helpful and nice, great atmosphere. The company was very organized and you learn how to make a good cup of coffee."
good,"Well trained on handling customer complaint and customer service "
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. Everyone is so kind to one another, and you’re there to do your job. It’s really nice to like your job and be excited for work."
good,"The hardest part is the rush hours, it can be a little crazy and messy but in the end it gives you the feeling of accomplishment. The best part is we all have a good time with laughs and smiles. The management is very helpful with development, hours, and training experience."
good,"I was a student back then and I had to quit because of the schedule of time that was given to me by the manager. I had conflict with the schedule, I have to prioritise my school because I will graduate already."
good,Starbucks allowed me the opportunity to attend college and get my bachelor's while receiving benefits and a paycheck. Management and the culture of the workplace were overall great.
good,"At Starbucks you're always learning something new every day. The job can be difficult during it's 'peak' hours, but it's rewarding. Regular customer are happy to have a conversation. I learned how it's okay to start conversations with our customers while they are waiting for their order. The free drinks are a plus as well. If you're working at a Starbucks Drive-Thru, it can be warm or cold depending on the weather, since you're next to a window."
good,I have been a Hyvee employee for over a year now and transferred to starbucks. I enjoy the environment but don’t get enough hours or pay in my opinion. I am looking for 35-40 hour weeks and only receiving 22 hours. The people I work with are very kind and supportive. I learn something new everyday.
good,"I was fortunate to have had an overall great experience working for Starbucks. Most of my colleagues were bright, professional, and respectful, but there are always a few bad apples in any work place and that happened too. Customers are better than the usual ""fast food"" customer and are generally patient with waiting for a custom made drink. I loved interacting with the huge diversity of people in the main business district of Miami Beach. "
good,Collègues venant du monde entier. Équipe sans prise de tête avec une bonne culture entreprise.
good,"Decent benefits, get free coffee while I work, the free pound every week is nice. For the most part we all work as a team. Can be stressful but any job is."
good,"Great place to work Respect for everyone as an individual."
good,"It is easy-going however serving pace can pick up fast. Build great relationships with customers, and can be a welcoming environment. Discounts are the best part!"
good,"Little down time and the rushes can be crazy, but time flies when you’re busy! Store managers care about employee growth and development. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers, which the shift supervisors should be taking care of for you. Great first place to work!"
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced work environment, I've learned good customer service skills, and how to make hand crafted drinks fast. Management is good for the most part. The hardest part of the job is the fast paced work environment."
good,"Starbucks is a busy, fast paced environment. You want to make sure the customer is satisfied and gets what they want in a timely manner to keep the the line moving. It can get very busy which can be stressful but it’s A very fun and friendly work place."
good,"Working at Starbucks is enjoyable and time goes by fast. It's fun to work there as well as meet many regulars and new customers. Especially working on bar, it's fun to make drinks and as a result, see your customers smile."
good,"Loved working at Starbucks. The benefits were great and the people were even better. Really good entry job with lots of room for growth , flexibility, development really can't go wrong working here and benefits. I really enjoy working at Starbucks because the other employees make it fun to work as a team. You definitely need to be able to handle stress well though, as it can be very busy and customers want to be served fast."
good,"It is realle great to work in Starbucks, the place is very clean and the Supervisor and the Manager are really good people and everyone is concerned about you and if you are learning enough."
good,You get paid tips on top of your per hour pay. Great benefits like college reimbursement and free music. Lots of customers to build relationships with.
good,I went to oregon over the summer with family and my cousin got me into starbucks at 16 where i worked minimum wage and had a decent experience working there.
good,"Management at my current store is highly committed to their employees and making sure that everyone is taken care of."
good,"If looking for a part time job with health benefits because you’re a parent, college student, or other job doesn’t haven’t it, just need to work 20 hours per week to qualify and keep! Most stores are good with working with your availability, giving you the hours to qualify for benefits, often fellow co-workers willing to help cover in case of emergencies. Other perks include premium Spotify, leave for adoption or family emergencies, 401(k) and stocks, up to 10 days of emergency childcare, comprehensive healthcare plans, picking up shifts at other stores with mileage reimbursement, free lunch meals. Hardest part is during rushes and trying to keep up with orders, but once you master the skills is doable."
good,"Continuous influx of customers; you're always in high gear.  Fun place to work, but you WORK HARD.  Breaks are 10 mi nutes long.  You get 1 for a 6 hour shift.  The other 5 hours and 50 minutes are spent standing up on a concrete floor; no rubber mats."
good,You will have a shifting schedule at Starbucks and around 10 hours duty a day with limited food and beverage benefits. Fun place to work if you love to interact with people.
good,The experience at star bucks was new and like able . Meeting new people was a best part. Greeting them and making sure they Were satisfied and will return.
good,"Really good work culture. There is a strong sense of community with both the other staff and the customers. Flexible work hours, pays above minimum with consistent raises and amazing benefits & perks."
good,I absolutely loved working here but the one thing that made me go was the poor management. Sometimes I would show up to work and lots of times my manager for that day would be a no call no show. They did not listen to my requests for my schedule even though they claimed they were flexible. At the time I worked two jobs and they did not seem to want to take that into consideration.
good,"It’s a great opportunity they help you with school, great pay plus tips so it’s great. Loved my co workers. You build strong relationships with customers it’s and overall great job."
good,"My coworkers were fun and we typically had a great time. There is a lot of stress when working the morning shift and dealing with customer ""pre-caffeine""."
good,"When staffed well, working at Starbucks is a great experience. Every store is often busy, however, with hard work and dedication, every day is well worth it."
good,"I learned valuable skills such as sales, cash handling, food safety, customer satisfaction and keeping up with a fast pace. Management depends on location."
good,It has been a great environment so far. Everyone has been so friendly and welcoming since I have started working there. Anytime I need help I feel comfortable asking anyone. The manager is great too.
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks. I only left because, I wasn't making enough money. meet some great people. The good customers out weigh the bad ones."
good,"The workplace is very outstanding, busy location, the hardest part of the job would be remembering many recipes. I enjoy the added tips every week and the many benefits of working for starbucks."
good,Starbucks was my very first job. It’s pretty much all I have known. Ive loved all 13 years I’ve spent here. The company will always have your back and only want you to succeed even if it’s outside of Starbucks
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. It provides many important skills in life. It is a fast paced environment and the work days go by fast. There are many great benefits to being a partner
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, good employee benefits like health insurance and education. The early opening shifts were a little rough and were difficult to balance with a normal sleep schedule."
good,"Always on a fast pace environment. I enjoy  their perks and my co-workers are all fun to work with. Shift work is kind a challenge specially for me because I work with two jobs.  Hardest part of the job, I didn't find any. I just quit there due to my relocation. I find that mix race of workers is great! Total diversity is one of the key of my workplace which become our advantage in our store."
good,"Good work for students and those going back to work after a period of time off. Management differs between district but at the core of the company, people want you to succeed."
good,"A great place to work if you need benefits like health insurance and want school paid for. they partner with ASU so the options of a bachelor's in something is limited to what they offer, but none the less, its a free degree. The only requirement to the benefits is to work a minimum of 20 hours a week. The job culture is pretty easy going. Just work in your position and you'll be fine."
good,"The staff definitely make it a great work environment, you get to meet different types of people and create new relationships. Starbucks is definitely on top of making sure every costumer feels welcome as well as their staff, work hours are VERY flexible. They pay could definitely be better specially considering how expensive it is to live in Toronto."
good,"I’ve worked for about 2-3 years. My coworkers were awesome. So was both of my Bosses. A great team is everything. Starbucks is great for those who enjoy engaging with different types of people, perfect for those who are extroverts by nature. It’s a fun and fast-paced work environment."
good,"La cultura es muy amigable, te ayuda a desarrollarte interpersonalmente y hay mucho control de los procesos."
good,My over all experience with Starbucks was a good one. at certain times of the year it would be a fight for hours if you are looking for full time truly just depend on the condition of the store as well. For the most part you will work with a group of peers from all walks of life who will certainly make an impression on your own.
good,"I absolutely love starbucks culture as a whole though i had a horrible experience with my previous manager don’t let that deter from the entire job as a whole , enjoyed all time i spent with my cows provers and the company."
good,"Great benefits. Good work to life balance. Can be hard to move up past being a SM but easy to make new contacts. Great community culture, always engaged with their neighborhood"
good,Very flexible it had a great staff and they were all team orientated . That job was truly amazing. There was space  for growth and opportunity which I loved
good,"Starbucks has been one of my favorite paces to work at. Meeting, and getting to know the regulars made the job so much more worth it. Although working at a drive thru that was located by a middle school tested my patience, it was so worth being part of the Starbucks team due to the amazing customers!"
good,"I enjoyed working for a company that truly believed in and lived by the mission of the company. As a marketer, it was amazing to brand on a brand with so much consumer love."
good,Working at Starbucks builds your patience level and shows you how people cam be in the real world. They provide amazing benefits from free drinks/ food to healthcare and tuition reimbursement. Overall it is a great place to work if you have team members and management supporting you.
good,"Great company to work for, but some of the 'leaders' in place were lacking the Starbucks culture. Outside of that, I had a pleasant experience with the company."
good,"Every shift you were thrown in to the rush at the time. You had to get used to moving fast and adjusting to the pace of the job. I learned how to handle difficult customers and how to create relationships with the regulars. Management unfortunately was not so great where I was but despite that, the job went smoothly due to the extensive training given to us. The hardest part of the job was probably handling really difficult customers that would get really upset and take out their frustrations on you. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting all the people that come through. I made lasting relationships with my coworkers and it helped make the job easier and more enjoyable."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. The harder you work for them, the more they invest in you. They really do notice and appreciate your efforts and will reward you for it. This company has a lot of opportunity for growth, as well as benefits that can really be beneficial if you take advantage of them."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, cuenta con muy buenas prestaciones y es un trabajo que tiene flexibilidad en los horarios de trabajo"
good,"The experience really depends on the the type of store (rest-stop, urban, residential) and the store's culture. Overall, I had a positive experience, but that couldn't be said for partners at other nearby locations."
good,Working the morning shift when you first start is not the best way to throw in a new employee. It is very overwhelming and other workers have to make up for the slack of the new hire making everyone having to work harder than necessary.
good,"Being a barista at Starbucks was very fun. You meet different people everyday and fun co-workers. Great work place, Free Partner Beverages and great benefits."
good,Good environment for students and young adults. Easy to get promoted with experience. Evaluations every 6 months which allowed for a percent-based pay raise.
good,Starbucks Jobs are like the Coffee Awesomeness!!Only downer is the pay. Its busy so you will always be moving but the customers and your staff are Amazing and help the time pass.
good,"I was typically in the barista position while at work, though I sometimes ran the cash register. Overall this was a fun and awesome job. I loved getting to know the regulars."
good,"Great to work at, however the only complaint is if there isn't enough support at work, job will be challenging. Has to be efficient communication for the day to go fine. At times there will be those customers who have the biggest complaints over very small things, but as long as you can maintain a friendly smile and just do whatever that needs to be done so the customer can go on about their day."
good,"Starbucks was a lovely place to work, you come in contact with so many different customers throughout the day. great place to work, grow, and network."
good,"Working at Starbucks created long lasting friendships between me and my coworkers, it really feels like being a part of a team. The customers are another bonus, making connections with the regulars is one of the best parts."
good,Starbucks gave me so much happiness when I first started in 2016. I loved everything about working there. The people were amazing and I enjoyed the fast past rush hours every morning. The whole staff and management were amazing when I went through hard times and transitions. I’m finally saying goodbye to work in a field I see myself getting a degree in. 8.5/10 would recommend.
good,"Working at starbucks is a lot of fun if you're a high energy person. The management CAN be great, it depends on the store and your timing. The hardest part of the job is mainly managing your stress and problem solving when it comes to difficult customers."
good,"There is a steep learning curve at Starbucks, and it takes time to become proficient on all the work stations. The most stressful part of the job is often interacting with customers while under high pressure."
good,"Stays busy i worked at starbucks for 10 to 11 months. It was nice, but managers can do better with how they disscriminate , am not sure was it my location only or is management like that at all stores."
good,"A very nice and warm place to work. Lovely people willing to help you and guide you around and train you. Starbucks is a nice place to get customer service experience, and a good place to grew as a person and think about the business."
good,"Starbucks provides excellent benefits, decent pay, and a workplace culture that is very considerate of the employees. The hardest part of the job is the constant stress and the amount of physical and emotional activity required. There is quite literally no down time and I would not consider this job to be relaxing in the least. Despite the high level of stress, Starbucks more than makes up for this with the way they treat their employees in terms of benefits and pay."
good,"Starbucks is a great job while in school. The employees there are supportive and the company heir from withing making it easy to grow with the company."
good,"Its a place that gives you the opportunity to meet different cultures, the diversity of backgrounds of all the partners make starbucks a fantastic experience of life."
good,"The pay isn’t the best for what we have to put up with, but I really really loved working at Starbucks and wish I never left. The atmosphere is great. The customers are great and the benefits are great"
good,"A typical day working as a barista at Starbucks, usually started with updating myself on sales productivity and any shortages of products, also informing myself about any deals or promotions I should know about before starting my shift. More than often I would be stationed at the bar to prepare and craft coffee beverages for the remainder of my shift. However, if I was ever needed at the cash register or at the drive thru I was always willing to change tasks throughout my shift. I learned so much especially how to engage with all kinds of interesting folks, learned how to move quickly and proficiently, and great team-work skills. The hardest part of the job was being able to work fast paced while making the drink orders to the customers exact specifications. The most enjoyable part of the job was making such a deep connection with some of the regular customers and finding a new passion for the art of coffee I never knew I'd enjoy so much!"
good,The best part about working at Starbucks is getting to see your 'regulars' who came in frequently and get the same thing almost every time.  Already knowing their drink and how to make they way they like can really brighten up their day. And for those days where you're a bit overwhelmed or not 100%; getting to see one of your favorite customers can really boost your spirits.
good,"It's a fast pace work place, always need to be prepared to work under pressure. Having multitasking skills will definitely come in handy when working, but great work environment and great place to work if looking for a part-time with good benefits."
good,"There is a bit to learn about the drinks provided by starbucks. Overall its a great job especially when it comes to benefits. I had me and my wife covered for only 40 dollars a month. It covered everything in that price as well vision, dental, and medical."
good,"Starbucks is known to be stressful and that is very true. Partners are very very good to each other, we became family. Management at my store could have been better but it was not too bad. This all depends what store you work at. Some will not have hours to give you because they hire too many people."
good,"Hired pretty much anyone, which made a good job more stressful than it should've been.it was fun and people there  were nice but lacked leadership it could be better"
good,"This job is a great job if you love the changes of pace in your work environment, it can be calm one second and then crazy the next. but it has a fun positive vibe to it if you are working with the right crew"
good,This was a good first job starting out as a teenager. My managers were very flexible with my work schedule and helped me work around my school schedule.
good,Being a Baristas is sometimes exhausting but rewarding. There is a lot to learn and remember as well as expectations of speed and connection with customers.
good,Customer service was very important. Building relationships with regulars was encouraged. Management was firm but flexible if any personal issues required movement in your schedule. Hardest part of the job was maintaining a level-headed demeanor while handling numerous customers at once. The most enjoyable part was seeing the fruits of the relationships you built with the regulars.
good,"it was a good entry level job to help me get on my feet. the personnel are relaxed and generally fun most of the time, though with bad management at times."
good,not bad. had fun learning all of it. employees are chill and nice peak points can be stressful. the job is what it pays its easy and not much to handle
good,"The more places I worked, the more knowledge I gained about the different departments and where my interest lies."
good,"Short and sweet its store dependant. There is a lot to learn and if you work at a busy mall stores its tough labour, I'm talking sweat-inducing but the management is very nice because of it. other stores its            the opposite if they are not busy they are ruthless in management"
good,I’d say Starbucks is a great company to work for. I’ve had a bad experience with managers when I first got hired but she was quickly fired. Most employees are poorly selected by management and go quickly in my experience at the Chelan wa store because it’s so busy but overall Starbucks is a good company .
good,I have really enjoyed working at Starbucks. I always wanted to work there so when I finally got the job I was thrilled. You have to be able to multi-task and be ready to run while at the same time making drinks perfectly to the customers satisfaction. It's a great place to meet new people and build great connections.
good,"My former co workers were some of the best personalities I have ever worked with. The encourage to ""connect"" with your customers and fellow coworkers. Which I think really brought the team work amongst my team. I really appreciated the value of a regular costumer because you really gain from making new friends working at starbucks."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great experience for me. They have very good benefits and the company always tries to be fair and sensitive to the needs of the emplyees. If you're shy or outgoing, it doesnt matter, this company tries its very best to accommodate everyone's needs. I highly recommend this company to anyone who is thinking about working for them."
good,This job depends on how easily shaken mentally you are. The job demand is large from customer and direct report managers. Great company as far as benefits and pay.
good,"The Starbucks Warehouse Is A Great Environment to Be In Filled With Great People All Around, Including: Coworkers, Supervisors, Trainers, Management, And Even The Big Wigs. The Smiles You See Throughout The Shift Will Get You Through The Shift🤝"
good,"Starbucks is very fast paced and sometimes stressful. I feel like the pros out way the cons most of the time but sometimes you can feel the stress. They offer incredible benefits and it makes working there worth it in the long run. It's a great place to learn and grow in, because nothing is ever the same everyday."
good,"Starbucks cares a lot about its employees, they receive amazing benefits and opportunities. "
good,Really what made working for Starbucks were my fellow employees and my shift leader. They were all truly great people and we actually cared for one another and helped each other out.
good,this job is a very easy job for someone who wants to work less than a typical full time job. Perfect for high school or college students who don't have open availability.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to learn management skills and develop into your next role is you wish to do so. "
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for 3 years and although I have enjoyed my time there was no advancement in company. I have stayed a Lead Barista and occasional Manager the entire time and the hourly pay is not enough for the amount of work, dedication and experience I had to do. I think this is a great easy job to get and keep for a long time but if you need bills paid expect a second job."
good,"The job is not easy by any means, and takes many people a long time. But that makes it so much more rewarding when you finally master it. Becoming a Coffee Master was one of the things im most proud of that ive accomplished. I loved this job because it constantly kept me busy and on my toes. On top of this, my coworkers at starbucks became the family I never had. I felt like I truly belonged there. My manager was an amazing guy, a lifelong friend, though he did lack some managerial skills and seemed to focus too much on the friend aspect. Everyone that I worked with at Starbucks, I am still in contact with. Although i loved the environment, the pay is not substantial. After 4 raises, i was only making 63 cents more than my original salary (9.05 --> 9.68). This being said, this is a perfect job if you are not the main source of income in your home, and is an enjoyable and fun place to go to work everyday."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for and my customer service skills have grown tremendously while working with this company."
good,"Worked at Starbucks from my sophomore year of high school till I graduated college. Was always flexible with my schedule, made good money for relatively easy work."
good,I really enjoyed working for the company. Made a lot of great friends and had a lot of memorable experiences. Fair wage and good benefits make it a worthwhile place to be!
good,"I’m still working here so that means I like being a part of that job. I enjoy connecting and our helping policy to our guests, I enjoy it while I’m helping them. I like our partnership and the way most of our supervisors’ act on us. I don’t really have a problem with it. It’s not so hard. But sometimes it’s tiring."
good,This company is team based and proficient. I am very happy that I had the opportunity to work within the siren’s eye. I learned to be more social and more asserted.
good,"The job is not easy, more so if you're in a high volumen store. Rules and procedures are pretty simple but fallowing routine is very important, they strive on excellent quality of products and holds enployees responsible for it."
good,"I enjoyed the store I worked at. My coworkers were nice and helpful and when I needed to earn something new or tackle something a different way, they were very constructive and nice about it. I learned more about conversation and customer service while I worked there. I became less shy and more outgoing with every customer interaction I had. My management at the time was not the very best and he abrupted quite a few issues with my coworkers and me, but we still worked as a team to eventually sort out the scheduling and hours. I think the hardest part about working at Starbucks was figuring out how to deal with certain customers. It takes patience and time to handle people who come off as rude or impersonal to you. You overcome that frustration and replace it with the bonds and relationships you make with other customers. The most enjoyable part of being a team member at Starbucks are the coworkers. You go through everything together and everyone is from different backgrounds and different ages. I learned a lot from them and I had a relationship with every single one of my coworkers. There was never a bad relationship."
good,I liked Starbucks it was really fun making the drinks and everything but what really made me quit was my coworkers they were just really mean to me because i was the youngest at the time. I didn’t feel wanted at all.
good,High spirit work place with motivated individuals. Customers were very generous and a joy to be around. My favorite part about this was job was meeting amazing people all over the valley.
good,I still enjoy working here but I am looking to advance my career elsewhere. Not worth the stress and less pay with moving upward with the company. ...
good,"had my jon in starbucks while i was just arrived in england, i have learned a lot,starting with a new lenguahe and a different kind a customer service that i dealed with on other places in europe,just the salary wasn't enough after i earned my skills and it wasn/r any more career for me above supervisor because it was a small shop."
good,"Great job for someone looking for part time work and had another income or in school. They have great college achievement program through ASU online and will contribute to 401k, it's competitive to get full time- it's only available to supervisors, which would allow for more benefits."
good,Fast paced and exciting. Good crew. Pay is underwhelming but fantastic benefits. It's nice to get to know the regulars and have their drinks ready to go before they can even order.
good,"Starbucks is an inherently stressful job. However my experience was made much more enjoyable with the great people I got to work with."
good,The work environment was awesome. Definitely developed my connection with people as a team player and as good barista to our customers. Workplace is so well put up
good,Any time I had trouble remembering a drink or something to do my coworkers were very friendly and always happy to be there. The customers could get on my nerves but the supervisors were always there for any help. The work wasn’t too hard but remembering the beverages would take time.
good,Great place to work at as your first job to learn the ropes of customer service. Its a fast paced environment however it flies by with a good team working together. Wish it payed a little more but overall not a bad experience.
good,I’ve been working at Starbucks for a little over a year. Ive been able to move up within the company pretty quickly and enjoy what I do. I have several friends I’ve made at my store and it’s a great community to be a part of. My only negative remark I have in regards to Starbucks is management. My store manager does not thank certain people who work harder than others and likes to overwork everyone.
good,Would be me on bar the whole time while being told what to do 24/7 and getting a lot of my breaks skipped. Also the shifts at this store think they are better than everyone else that works here so I need to work in a better environment.
good,"Starbucks was my first job ever. Good for starters, good for those than can take pressure and love a hands-on challenge. There is undoubtedly more pressure at a drive-thru store then just a regular café store.  A majority of the partners are very welcoming to the new workers. They all will teach you some thing that can help you seize a day of work. They will mostly be as helpful as they can be. You get one free meal, and a free beverage any day that you work a shift. "
good,"Various job duties, always something new to do."
good,Great place to work at I really recommend it to a lot of students and everyone else that would like to apply. It’s an essay job and they accommodate to your won schedule depending the type of situation.
good,"La cultura del café y de ser partner te envuelve en un entorno familiar, y hace un buen ambiente de trabajo. Las prestaciones son muy buenas y los horarios son flexibles, lo que ayuda a  conjugar tu vida laboral con tu vida fuera del trabajo"
good,"The people I worked with, including management, were very nice people to work with. Everyone worked together to ensure customer satisfaction. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of rotating around from being Lobby, Customer Support, Drive Thru, Bar, or Food. I make coffee, teas, frappucinnos, as well as clean bathrooms, mop floors, sweep, stock fridges, make back-ups, and label products with expiration dates. The hardest part about the job is that it is very fast paced and it can be difficult to multi-manage everything at once. But you get to work with awesome people and the atmosphere is very chill."
good,Its a fun place to work but its not a job that you can make into a career and make decent money. Customers definitely test your patience but I've learned a lot from this job.
good,"Starbucks is a really high paced environment, much more so than I believe any partners let on. I've seen capable partners quit after the first week because at its root, it is a high stress job. I believe it isn't exactly fair compensation wise as far as long term partners who have been working with the company 5+ years but are still making 10-11 dollars an hours, versus out of company employees who are hired as shifts and start out at $14 an hours an hour. Other than that, the job itself is very enjoyable (especially for someone like me who thrives in stressful environments). The people are friendly and the work is satisfactory in comparison to other restaurant or fast food companies I have worked for."
good,"It is truly a work place that strives for excellence in all that they do. I enjoy the atmosphere of being able to connect with costumers and put a smile on peoples face everyday. However, this job does not pay enough to make a career out of it, and as a barista I feel as though it does not challenge me enough mentally and I need to do more problem solving for my career."
good,I loved working at Starbs! Definitely a fast paced environment but you get used to it. Enjoyed the work and my coworkers. The culture was very chill and laid back for how busy it is.
good,"Learned a lot of skills very quickly, good pay and benefits, and you get stock in the company. I enjoyed interacting with other staff members and customers directly"
good,You are allowed to be who you are and there is freedom to learn as much as you want. Company culture is a big deal but the hardest part of the job is trying to stay ahead of the rush without losing your mind
good,"Company focused on partners and customers. Great overall benefits package. Low hourly wages at Barista and Shift supervisor levels, competitive management pay. Offer stocks, health care, 401k matching, food/drink benefits/discounts, Spotify. Fast paced, customer focused environment."
good,Interacting with numerous customers. Building interpersonal relationships while creating high quality beverages. Team building creating while applying knowledge and leadership skills.
good,I really enjoyed the sense of community I experienced working at Starbucks. I would highly recommend this job to someone looking for a part time job who enjoys multi-tasking and customer service.
good,a typical day at Starbucks is everyone being very talkative and making sure everything is done but doing it in a fun and energetic way.  while working at Starbucks I've learned that people don't always go with the gender pronouns. I was able to learn that everyone has equality even though I knew about it I just never experienced it. the hardest part of the job I would say is when it gets busy you have to stay in the area you were set at because if one person moves it can mess up the whole system.
good,"Es un buen trabajo estable, con buenas prestaciones y salario arriba del promedio en puestos similares, aprendes mucho la atención a clientes, ventas e higiene. En lo personal me pareció muy divertido y es un buen ambiente, incluso en los momentos de presión, se te van las horas rapidísimo. La parte más complicada son los cierres, terminas saliendo a las 2am, y no te pagan las horas extras. A veces te ponen cierres seguidos o una apertura al día siguiente y obviamente así es difícil tener un buen desempeño cuando no puedes ni dormir. En muchas ocasiones están cortos de personal o simplemente al gerente le da por aumentar horas extras sin siquiera preguntarte y si reclamas o lo mencionas se molestan. Dicen ser flexibles en los horarios pero no es así. "
good,yöneticilerin çalışanları yaklaşımı çok yapıcı ve olumludur. çalışma saatleri yasal sürelere uygun. kariyerde ilerleme ve personel eğitim programları etkin.
good,"My time at Starbucks was amazing. I enjoyed the crew and they''re synergy. The manager was very flexible and attentive to scheduling needs while pushing for the best possible numbers. All of the leads were well trained and motivating. The customers were, overall, awesome to interact with and learn more about."
good,Starbucks has amazing benefits and the core values of the company strive to have an open inviting place for all to come use and be comfortable in. This to me is amazing.
good,"The specific location I worked at in had very special circumstances. It was located on the outskirts as the last place for food or drink before hopping onto the tollway into the main city, and as a result it was incredibly busy. It was also a duel drive-through and walk in. The building itself was smaller than the demand called for, and as a result the amount of employees who could be working at any given time was limited. Even though demand was high and work was always on peak, the employees grew very close and formed a very tight-knit community as a way to deal with the craziness. I learned to always be on my toes, multitask like a god, handle upset customers and make genuine human connections over a cup of overpriced coffee."
good,"Starbucks has been an incredible company to work for. Although I have only been with the company for close to a year and a half, I have found the employee benefits to be wonderful and the commitment to quality engagement with customers to be unparalleled."
good,"I enjoyed the process of making drinks, assisting guests, and prepping food.  The employee benefits were a great perk for me as well, and I felt like I was really accomplishing something while I was there."
good,"Great benefits if you work at least 20 hours. Flexible. Great culture. Pay is lacking. Good second job. If you are a student, this could be good for you."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a wonderful experience, it helped increase my communication skills not only with the customers that came in but with those that worked with me as well. The management was conscious of everyone's needs and with that all the partners of the store looked after each other and made sure that we were meeting all of the customers needs. The hardest part of the job is making sure the customer receives what they wanted because some times the drinks can be confusing but it all comes down to how well the communication aspect of the experience went. When the communication aspect is met then the whole job in itself its enjoyable, talking to customers and getting to know the regulars, speaking to the partners that work there and getting to know them. Which would them create a nice flow to the day."
good,I love Starbucks and the management I work under. It is a very fast paced work environment that I thrived in. I enjoyed always being busy. This job taught me new communication skills I did not previously have. I learned efficient ways of multitasking.
good,"The training is poor, but once you get the hands on experience it’s pretty easy work to do. Building the different drinks is one of the best parts of this job"
good,"Starbucks treats their employees very well. They provide excellent benefits, schooling paid for, expect high levels of customer service, and make every moment warm and welcoming to customers. They tend to be very diverse throughout the whole company and each store is a 'safe place' and everyone is welcome."
good,"Working at Starbucks can be a pretty challenging on the customer service side. You have much more interacting with your customers, creating the need for emotional and social intelligence."
good,"I loved the culture and the people at Starbucks.  This is truly what makes the company so special."
good,"A typical work day includes interacting with customers, preparing beverages, and multitasking in a high-paced environment. I learned to interact with others. The hardest part of the job would be in management as it relates to understaffing. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the connections you make with customers."
good,"It really all depends on your manager and co workers [fellow Baristas]. When I joined, training wasn't done properly so there were a lot of things I was unsure of. However, I did get the hang of it all. In addition to, I do not dread coming to work every shift. I usually worked morning and during [our city's peak]. It can be very fast paced and demanding and even a little frightening at first; but as long as you have a decent manager and great baristas to help you along the way you'll be just fine! Great discounts, if you work full-time I'm sure you get even more bonuses and benefits!"
good,"Very friendly staffs, all working together (great teamwork!) to achieve the store's goal. As a big company the system was very well made and maintained, with specific rules and disciplines that makes it easier for the employees to perform their job."
good,"The store I worked at was really busy all the times, there are only 1-2 hours a day where we had no long line of customers waiting to order. "
good,Fast fun and friendly environment  company really cares about partners and very resourceful and helpful with college and benefits. I really enjoy the diversity and satisfaction of customers.
good,"The goal is to have a good work environment but this is heavily dependant on the store, customers, and management. I shifted to a couple of stores and each manager wanted to have a positive environment."
good,"Awesome team to work it, makes any job worth it. "
good,"Work at Starbucks is very physically demanding, needing constant movement and engagement with customers while simultaneously making drinks or grabbing items. However the work itself is very fun and rewarding, and the relationships built with the regulars are more than worth it. Couple that with free drinks and a meal during your shift, and a free pound of coffee each week, you'll be very happy to do the work."
good,"Starbucks was definitely a very fast-paced and sometimes stressful environment, but it paid off with a collaborative and friendly workplace."
good,"I loved working there. The people are all so kind and inviting. We have two weeks of training as a barista, online and in real life. There is a trainer assigned to you and he/she will show you everything you need to know. The hardest part was always the rushes because it requires teamwork on all levels and fast-paced acting. If you work well as a team but are slow, customers are angry. If you are fast but not a good team, the atmosphere is toxic and uninviting. THe best part about the job was definitely the people I met - both coworkers and customers. These people will make you smile if you're having a bad day or be understanding. Having a relationship between barista and customer (like remembering name and order) makes their day even the tiniest bit better. "
good,Fun for ppl who like coffee love the people around me and the way we all worked as a team!!!!!!!! The pay is horrible they Do to much work to be getting paid so little
good,"A typical day at work is always fast paced. There is never a dull moment! From having your peak early in the morning to having to step off the floor and prepare things for the next day. Also, having to juggle everyones breaks and time management to make sure things won't be effected from having someone step off the floor. I absolutely love the customers and have so many connections."
good,The company takes care of all their employees with great benefits. Management all ways tries to work with every partner to make sure they have a good working environment.
good,I worked here as my first job. Tons of fun and I would actually would go back if I had the option. Taught me a lot of team work and working with customers who have many different needs and want and having to balance them all.
good,"Starbucks has been a fantastic workplace and I’ve been recommending people to apply since I’ve started with the company in 2016!"
good,"Starbucks is a great place of culture, diversity, and customer service. The quality of the products are very good despite the high prices, which is a great advantage to being n employee there—DISCOUNTS! This includes free drinks and food per work pay. The hardest part of the job is maintaining an efficient workflow and customer satisfaction, especially during peak hours. It is easier when there is great management. The most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers and making global connections simply through a cup of coffee. The mission of starbucks is truly motivating and a great representation of customer service."
good,"A very fun , but challenging place to work at. "
good,"i started work at 7am and as soon as i walked in the store was packed, my starbucks was located in the financial district of san francisco. all the business men and women would traffic all day long from 7am to 6pm. the hardest part of my job while i was there was working in a small space with 7 other people, constantly bumping into people, constantly needing to squeeze between some coworkers to get to the other end of the bar. nonetheless i was able to get the job done."
good,"Starbucks was my first job and I believe that it was a great choice as my first, as it taught me many things and I gained plenty of experience. The management was great and very helpful especially for last minute call outs due to being sick or having an emergency. I learned how to give great customer service, along with being able to multi-task. Making drinks was truly enjoyable but it was difficult working some shifts due to rude/racist customers or dealing with coworkers who did not want to do their part. Working at Starbucks, requires you to be able work with a team and if one falls short, it can quickly become chaos. For any person being introduced to work force, i would definitely recommend Starbucks as you can learn customer service skills, food and health procedures, multi-tasking, critical thinking, and plenty of more things along the way."
good,"Starbucks was an enjoyable place to work, they offered great benefits to employees and I was treated fairly every shift I worked. Management is great."
good,the place is a good place to work at if u are a teenager with little responsibility and bills to pay but if u are someone like me who needs the money to live your day to day life this probably isn’t the best job for you
good,"Time management skills and multitasking are a must for Starbucks, in addition to great attitude and understanding demeanor. The company provides a wide opportunity for interior growth. And will ensure every partner before resignation, master the art of customer service."
good,"If you work here, make sure to keep a positive attitude and always be diligently with your work. There will always be something to do around the store whether it be helping on bar or cleaning."
good,"Starbucks was always a really fun place to work, at least in my area. The people I worked with were always nice and decently well put together, though the management sometimes seemed to be lacking. They were very ""catty"" I suppose, young and very involved in cliques with other employees. Other than that, it was fun. Customers were always very nice, I had my fair share of regulars. Some of them would even bring in cookies and stuff, it was really sweet. :)"
good,"I have enjoyed working for Starbucks. I like the environment, they have good benefits and I enjoy what I do. The pay isn't ideal, but they have great benefits and are worth it for a lot of people. I have a particularly wonderful manager who works to make sure that my work/life balance is ideal and works with my schedule. Overall, a great company."
good,"I had very good management, which makes a difference.  I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job.  The hardest part of job is keeping up during the customer rush time."
good,It's a good job but bad at the same time because it's not a consistency of hours ..your hours job from 30 one week to 20 or 15 hours the next week .. I personally liked it at one point and then I didn't
good,Would go back if I could afford to make a living. This place was the best job I ever had. I loved to make drinks and talk to the customers; we were like a family.
good,"Hours can be frustrating b/c may work every day but it is only a 5 hr shift. Hard to come by 8 hr shifts just being a barista, at least for me. Overall, great training and the work keeps you busy."
good,"Coworkers and manager were amazingly pleasant to work with. I had to leave because I needed a more reliable schedule and didn't want to work both mornings and nights all the time in a given week. But that is a flaw in the company not the manager, and I would definitely work under the right starbucks manager again. Customers were occasionally rude, but overall a way better environment than 7-eleven."
good,"Cool and laid back place to work. Depending on management, it’s a breeze; luckily I had great management and co workers, so it was a lot of fun. You don’t work too hard."
good,"I worked at Starbucks full-time as a supervisor while putting myself through school. Will help you with skills like time management, working with various personalities, and teach you how to stay calm during periods of stress. I think it was flexible enough to work around school schedules and often times can be fun with the right team. Location transferring is easy, I had worked at 5 different home stores during my 5.5 years. Benefits are great."
good,"Overall it was a fun place to work, it took a while to get used to the tasks but once you do its easy. Making drinks is fun, and the customers are fairly nice. But the staff itself were all very high maintenance and don't help you out that much when you're new and struggling. And it was a pretty bad environment at times due to staff conflict. But when everyone was getting along it made for a very enjoyable day at work."
good,The company itself is amazing. You get to meet some really great people. You get to know your customers by name and on a personal basis. The job is very fast paced and stressful but doable.
good,The job is quite easy to get into although can get repetitive. Management use to care quite a bit about the job culture. Things have changed and the company is more automated than ever.
good,Super flexible position- for hours and position . Store culture totally depends on the team working together and the competency of management. Coworkers become friends pretty quickly
good,"Requires a lot of learning, fast paced, always working with others.  Can be fun, learn good interpersonal skills and food service training.  Pay isn't the best, but tips and good benefits help."
good,"I worked at a drive through, so our work had to be done very quickly and in a timely manner, while keeping a smile on your face, and greeting everyone"
good,I had a great time working at Starbucks. It was the first real job I had. I learned/gained many skills working there. I made a lot of new friends while working there.
good,"The place working there is like family, but unfortunately due to my mother's illnesses I have to leave to the place for reasons, it's not like I hate the place or hate the people, it's just bad timing also my dad divorced my mother at the time. Starbucks is a great place to work for make new friends and meet new people. And I love the feeling of greeting someone and they greet you back"
good,"overall experience was great, it was a great learning block for moving forward. Gained skills in multiple areas that I can now use and demonstrate in a more professional setting."
good,"I excel at my job and enjoy the work that I do, however I would like to see more opportunities for growth and investment in the employees. Starbucks sells a lot of ideas of value but it is not reflected through management."
good,"Starbucks is a great long term job investment with their 401K 100% match up to 5% contribution, free stock options (RSU), and opportunities for advancement in the company. The longer you stay with the company the more you benefit through stocks and your 401K. Along with free coffee and 1 free food item per shift you work, it's not a terrible job. Some days the work load is a lot heavier than others depending on how busy it is and how much staffing there is, but it can be unpredictable when scheduling. "
good,"An average day at Starbucks has its slow points and its fast tempo points. When we were slow we would work on stocking and cleaning the store as fast as possible because we knew we would get busy shortly. When we got busy we would start our sequencing of beverages and food. When we got extremely busy, everybody helps everybody out making the job go much faster and more efficient. Everybody is always happy and there are people from all walks of life at Starbucks. This helps anybody grow as a worker and a person because we experience the unexpected everyday. The most enjoyable part about this job is working with the incredible co-workers."
good,I love working for Starbucks. I have been extremely lucky. I've had amazing managers that genuinely are caring towards my well-being. They always accommodate to what I can work. I have been employed while in school and they always helped to work around my schedule.
good,"Great people and atmosphere. Shifts passed quickly, easy once you get the hang of everything. Can be high stress, but if you keep your calm you get used to it."
good,Great company to work for. Helps with developing customer service skills and management skills.They worked well with my other job and school schedule.
good,Great insurance. Work environment is fun but it's hard work and you have to get used to constant customer abuse. The experience you have will really depend on your Store manager as to how each store is run and if they have your back or not.
good,"It’s a great place to work but I’d recommend for 30 and younger to work there. It’s very faced paced, but not a place I’d want a career in good if your in school or just trying to pay the bills. I felt like a family working there and I’ve never felt like that at any of my other jobs. You stay busy your whole shift."
good,"Good place to work, high paced, expectation for quality and professionalism, team like atmosphere with constant communication. Management was very hands on and always provided feedback on how to improve, or what you were doing right. Learned to deal with stressful situations, difficult customers, efficiency and quality."
good,I enjoyed my time greatly. I generally worked the late shift and was never incredibly busy but even working mornings were never stressful. I enjoyed my coworkers and was able to advance very quickly.
good,"Very fast pace, you have to enjoy people and talking. Gets very repetitive, have to be able to stand long periods of time. The perks are worth it and if you plan on being here a long time."
good,Es una empresa bastante completa en muchos ámbitos
good,"My review may not have to do with Starbucks in general. The company as a whole is wonderful to work with and the benefits have been so wonderful to me. However, in the last year, the district I am working in has managers that have projected homophobia and major corruption towards myself and other employees."
good,"Working at Starbuck is expremelly challenging, because you have a lot of duties and need to be very fast."
good,Choose your location wisely cuz you might be doing the same job but a much busier location is gonna actually stress you out. Making coffee is fun! Love when people come in and always have smiles on their faces.
good,"I really enjoyed working here and I made a lot of friends. The benefits were great. As a full time student with a exceedingly heavy course load, when I went to change my hours to fit my school schedule, the manager was not very accommodating and therefore I had to quit as it was causing a drop in my grades"
good,"Great people working for the company but regularly feel unappreciated, understaffed, too many promotional items, not enough training time ............"
good,I met some really interesting people and sometimes I didn't feel like I was at work even though I was working. I guess you can say that's a good thing. I felt like part of a tiny community.
good,Work can be super fast paced. Much to learn. They pay for college so that is a huge factor. They have great benefits if you can afford to work for low wages.
good,"I spent most of my time closing the store, that consisted of cleaning the facilities and food/drink products. Overall healthy working environment that I would recommend to any entry level candidate."
good,Starbucks is great for college students looking for a flexible schedule or part time workers just looking for insurance. It's a great way to learn how to work hard and work well in a team. The benefits are amazing and you only have to work 20 hrs a week to qualify.
good,A typical day at work was usually busy as I had morning shift in the summer but the work area was spacious and open. Great staff and employees. Great opportunity
good,"Everyday at Starbucks is a good day, I love waking up to making coffee... And serving it to everyone who comes in. Starbucks mostly consist of regulars or people we see everyday, I have built so many relationships off this. Along that they have great employees, Starbucks care about who they hire and how they will work together. It is a great job that can grow into a career for they give you so many opportunities to grow."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks, everyone I worked with was very supportive and helpful! The training process was easy to complete and any time you have questions are are unsure of something there is always someone to help you"
good,"Team based environment, fast paced with great team member. Everyone tends to be in a good mood and a culture is created around the store you work out to help each other better themselves and making the store the best it can be."
good,"The job is a basic barista job. Includes coffee making, coffee sales, cleaning, and money management. "
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. I was always busy, but had a great time working with other people. The management was not the best, but I was able to get time off if needed, and they worked around my schedule."
good,You will do lots of counting money and product. Giving out breaks to all your baristas and placing yourself wherever you need to to make the store flow nicely.
good,"It was what you expect from a minimum wage corporate job. It was easy, but fast paced at the same time. Enjoyed the constant pace as it made the shifts go by fast."
good,"A typical day for Starbucks for me was pretty straightforward. I was the designated pre-closer of the store helping wherever and whenever needed. I would make drinks, ring up customers, clean the lobbies and bathrooms throughout the day to lighten the load for the teammates who worked at night. The hardest part of the job was getting use to how certain customers wanted things made. Some were consistent, others not so much but with time and patience, it worked out. I was always smiling and greeting everyone to ensure that their experience was definitely worthwhile. Starbucks has taught me much about my personality in terms of what i can and can't handle, how much I actually do care for my customer base as well as team members and how important the impressions you leave on them are. The funnest thing was knowing customer orders and having them made before they get in the door and making regular customers friends over time. I've been there for about five years, but felt it was time to do something more up my alley and hospitality was the thing for me."
good,"This company allows you to explore different aspects of yourself and truly puts your patience to the test. You learn to multitask, work under pressure, and in a fast paced environment."
good,"It is grateful for working with an excellent team. We greet each other when one comes to work on shift, and most of us have a wonderful time connecting with the customers."
good,"Very role/routine oriented. Learned the importance of delegation and consistent communication. Strong workplace culture. Simple drink recipes. "
good,"Working at Starbucks is very fast-paced, but if you enjoy that like I do, then it's a lot of fun. There's definitely a ton of benefits and it's fairly easy to work your way up."
good,"Starbucks was a wonderful company to work for who treated their staff with lots of respect. They provided health benefits, bi-annual raises, stock options, and now I hear they even offer help with college tuition. They worked hard at educating their staff on the quality and origin of their coffees and how to create top quality drinks for their customers. Although it was a bit fast-paced and slightly stressful at times, it was overall a great customer service learning experience."
good,"Great place to work with great benefits and great company mission. It's important to be a people person (customers connections are super important) and someone who can make work for themselves on slow days. "
good,the culture of the workplace is really relaxed and fun. I love to brew coffee. To communicate with customers and maintain a clean environment is what I learned from working at Starbucks.
good,"Working for Starbucks was a nice past experience. My colleagues and managers were fun to work with, my working hours were always well divided and the payment was done correctly."
good,"great place for first job, easy to promote, 4 free beverages during shift, 50% off food during shift and 30% discount when not on shift. "
good,"I love being a Barista ,I love the partners I work with . We laugh and  joke when we have time .I get energized every time I have a regular guest that comes in and only wants me to make their drink but love to make new friends and connect with the new ones"
good,Fun fast paced place to work especially that i get the chance to interact with different kinds of people everyday. Very flexible scheduling. Also very good with helping people move up in the company
good,I worked at a store with a great manager and a fun team. I enjoyed my time there and always felt appreciated. Motivation is rewarded and there are plenty of opportunities for upward mobility.
good,"Yes you are making minimum wage, but you get to work with awesome people, serve great customers, and drink all the coffee you could dream of. After working a high stress job this was the perfect break, plus they pay for your first bachelor's degree."
good,I really enjoyed working at Starbucks but it wasn’t a life time job. I would even work here part time but it can be difficult on your body. It’s hard to stand for hours at a time.
good,"Working at starbucks generally means working in a fast paced environment under stress. I have had amazing coworkers in both of the cafes I worked in. I worked at two different cafes, one in Santa Barbara, CA and one located in Modesto, CA. The management in Santa Barbara was considerate and the store ran smoothly, while the management in my cafe in Modesto clearly didn't care much about his employees and the store was rather hectic. But its a on a case by case (or cafe by cafe) basis essentially. You can always transfer to another cafe if you don't like the one you're at, Starbucks does make that process very easy. The pay for working at Starbucks is definitely not what it should be given that its a demanding job but there are a lot of perks that come along with working there like employee discounts, free markouts, free food items and free drinks while working."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job is the family of baristas. The work environment is incredible when you have a supportive team. "
good,"Overall, a great part-time job. Some days were a little stressful, but for the most part, a pretty enjoyable experience. You can become quick friends with fellow partners and the flexibility of your work schedule is a huge benefit."
good,"Out of all the jobs I've had, Starbucks was one of the best ones. They  provide a good percentage off for employees, they are helpful, they give benefits an paid vacation after six months of working there without having to be full time. Like any other job it can be tiring and stressful but as long as you have an amazing team and management, it's not a bad job."
good,"Good opportunity to learn and grow in a good environment. "
good,"Overall I enjoyed working here, I just need something full time. Decent atmosphere, happy people, coworkers, etc. However, this is no job that any living being can live off of."
good,"Treats employees well with good benefits and lots of options for improvement no matter where you work. Management varies per location, but starbucks does a good job to try and maintain good managers."
good,"This was my first job, and I was given the chance to promote to a supervisor very early in my time with the company. The company really trains you to work the way they like you to, and this transfers well to almost any other job, which can be valuable work experience. The work pace can be very fast and stressful at times, though if you work with the right team it can still be fun. Management can unfortunately make or break your experience at any given store, and personally it was always the one aspect keeping me from truly loving working at Starbucks."
good,Friendly environment and overall great place to work. Co-Workers are helpful and management truly cares about their employees. Many career advancement opportunities.
good,"Worked hip to hip with tram and supported the partners in every way possible. "
good,The job itself is fun and fast paced- especially around the holidays. The shift leads always made the stressful times easier by making us laugh or playing fun music. Customers were more often than not nice and great to work with. Would recommend working here for someone who is going through college or looking for a part time job! Only downfall is pay.
good,"fun place to work, benefits are nice with free food and drinks, etc"
good,"Working at Starbucks varies by location, but all locations have a fast paced environment focused on quality service and customer connections. Team work is very important as well as a level headed nature."
good,it mostly depends on the coworkers and getting along with them. it was easy for me to be friends with everyone so i had fun most of the times. sometimes it gets slow and its more relaxed at evenings.
good,"The first thing a supervisor does when on the clock is look at the schedule and labor on the DCR sheet. This will let them know who is working which shift and what the daily labor looks like. They then assign each barista to a certain position on the floor (a role) and carry out the shift. They are responsible for taking phone calls, running breaks, serious customer complaints or questions, donations, inventory management, and cash management. If there is an inventory count to be done, they do it. It is a very organized, yet flexible position. I learned a lot about myself as a manager, as well as how to manage a team. The co-workers I was responsible for wonderful and helped me survive the insanely busy shifts. The company overall, however, did not make me feel entirely supported. Our district was in shambles and had very few employees, which made our own personal needs small in comparison to the needs of the company, which seemed ironic considering the company prides itself in supporting their employees immensely."
good,"I worked at Starbucks over ten years ago, but for the 2 years I spent with them it was a great time. They offered me amazing health coverage, stocks, and other great benefits."
good,"Starbucks was a very fun job,  a typical day there would be a lot of cleaning an making sure you follow the steps on making each drink correctly. Hardest part of the job was the anxiety that came with the rapid influx of customers usually during 2:00pm. Working at Starbucks I’ve learned how to stay cool, calm and collected during those high influx of customers."
good,I would recommend that students apply to Starbucks as the payment is really not enough to maintain & pay bills in the Los Angeles area. It is a fun job & they are pretty flexible when it comes to schedule.
good,"I would say overall Starbucks is a great company to work for, most of the issues you will deal with are the staff and the lower end management. That being said the benefits and job security is amazing and worth the stress of the work. Its normal job stress for the most part but what I liked the most was you could work all over. If you didn't like the manager or store you can transfer after 3 months. I ended up really liked the store I worked at but they give you so many options to make the work experience good."
good,"Gets really busy and customers don't like to wait. "
good,I believe that Starbucks is a great entry level job for people who would like to join the hospitality industry. Starbucks has a way of building work ethic and meeting company standards.
good,The job itself has its perks but the management can drive you away. Theres no room for advancement no matter how good of a barista you are. They promise promotions to people in the company for over 20 years that never get it.
good,"Fast paced, fun environment to work in. There is a lot to learn in a short amount of time, but there are many ways to learn and lots of help from co-workers."
good,A typical day at Starbucks would start with finding out who needs breaks and issuing breaks in the appropriate amount of time. Something i learned working at Starbucks was how to properly count a safe and how to deal with unsatisfied customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers that didn't receive to service they were expecting. The most enjoyable part of the job was building a relationship with the customers and being a part of their everyday routine.
good,"Es un buen lugar para laborar, brindan la capacitacion adecuada"
good,the customers make it enjoyable. easy work but demanding to make numbers. if there is not enough people on the floor it can become hectic but all in all its a fun job into the corporate coffee choice of america and beyond
good,"good place for part time job. Fast paced upbeat. Always on your feet, and must work hard to do a good job for customers. Important to be friendly and have good customer service."
good,"Really great and fun workplace, management was great, the only downside is the long hours but the icing with it is you get to make someone happy simply by just making their drink or just by giving them compliments, it would definitely make their day."
good,"When I worked at this Starbucks I thought how can anyone do this? There were so many customers in the store waiting to order or waiting for drinks. I was heavily intimidated. When I looked at the baristas and saw about 12-15 people all cool in demeanor, working smiling having a good time I knew there was a good vibe and that helped me make my decision."
good,"Starbucks was an amazing job, as I said, it never felt like work. Primarily because I love coffee and desserts plus I really enjoy customer interactions. If you love those, this job will be perfect for you. I loved making drinks as a barista. Once you get the hang of your job (a good bit of memorization), your hands will be moving so fast but somehow you'll create the perfect beverage every time."
good,"I can credit a great deal of my personal growth and knowledge over the years to my years of working at Starbucks. While sometimes rigid and set in their ideology, they're a phenomenal company that cares about it's employees. Management was a make or break here and I ultimately ended up leaving to broaden my horizons and learn more but I can credit this job to stoking and creating a passion for something I never knew existed."
good,Empresa con un gran ambiente laboral y mucha dedicación a otorgar un servicio de calidad que ayuda a pulir las cualidad de atención al cliente de los empleados.
good,"Working at Starbucks is extremely fun and rewarding for someone with the right attitude. There are always tasks to accomplish, so I rarely find myself bored. This is a fast paced environment which requires efficiency and an ability to be flexible with last-minute changes."
good,"In my opinion, the hardest part of this job is feeling underappreciated; from customers and management.  This is a difficult job and I wish the training plan was more in depth and hands on. It is very fast-paced, not FOR everyone."
good,"Overall an amazing atmosphere to work in. The only thing that I didn't really like was getting someone to cover your shift, especially if its an ergent."
good,"Starbucks you have to be quick and steady on your feet cause there's really not a time to stop, you have to work as a team it makes everything better."
good,"I would suggest working here if you are a college student. The hours are flexible, and they will pay for you to go to school online. You also can move up quickly to get that pay raise we all need."
good,"A good place to work but if you move up in the company they tend to demand your blood and soul with it. "
good,I work at StarBucks for a few months it’s was a pretty chill job. It’d get really busy but as long as everyone was doing their job things would end up fine. Management was pretty awesome and doesn’t automatically take the customer’s side. Pays well for college kids does offer a lot of benefits.
good,"Sometimes working at starbucks can get tough, especially when it comes to being short staffed during one of the busiest times of the year. It is really great to meet new people and work as a team"
good,"Working at Starbucks is a fast-paced job. When you first get hired on you have at least one week of training if not more. The training is simple but their is a lot to learn about different coffees and how to make them. The management was awesome when I worked there. I think the hardest part about working there is either learning how to do everything or when there is only 2 of you behind the counter, one taking orders and one making them."
good,"I had a good experience. The people I worked with in the store were great. Made some life long friends at my location. "
good,"Best part of the day is working with ""Partners"" (employee's) and customers, coffee is a fun environment.  Hardest part of the job today is keeping store staffed with early morning hours, late nights and weekend hours.  Many people are not interested in working these extended shifts."
good,"A good work environment, can tend to get a little stressful but that’s almost any job. Management right now isn’t the best and the hourly pay isn’t what I’m looking for m"
good,"Rediscovered why I love customer service. Constantly on my feet, never bored. Great staff and great customers all around. Getting to make a connection with customers and coworkers is the best experience."
good,"It was an enjoyable place to work. The best part of the job were "
good,This is a great company to work for has a great culture and the partners really care for each other. I would go back to work for them again in a heart beat.
good,"Kept me busy, moving and on my toes! A great first job that is for sure, you meet so many different kind of people and learn that COFFEE is not just COFFEE to them !!!!"
good,I loved the atmosphere and the customers. I had a bunch of regulars who would come in and grab a coffee just to talk with me. I learned how to make a bunch of different drinks. I also Enhanced my ability to multi-task.
good,"A typical day at work would include drink prep, cash register management and customer service. In a very fast paced environment, all employees found a way to minimize stress through fun and positivity."
good,The success of your store depends completely on management enforcing standards and them choosing to enjoy the work. This job can be rewarding and fun.
good,"Always was very enthusiastic to come to work , time flew by working at a fast- pace. Quick and easy to catch on to things with proper training. Exceptional magagement ."
good,Starbucks is an enjoyable workplace due to its exciting environment in which takes care of the employees. the benefits that the company provides certainly outweigh the challenging aspects.
good,"Fast-paced, start making drinks right away, always make sure items are stocked, get to know regular customers and their preferences, always ensure area is clean."
good,Very fast past environment fun and great a great experience. Flexible work schedule poor pay for the tasks handed to you. Would recommend great service and beverage quality
good,"Everything we do on a typical day revolves around customers. With that said, the main things we do is that we prepare beverages and food items, maintain store cleanliness. We strengthen the customer connection by greeting the customers, remembering their names if they're regulars, and knowing what they would order."
good,"You start your every day at Starbucks as a new day with new targets in mind. Being a Starbucks employee I learnt a lot of things which helped me grow my skills. The management at Starbucks is cooperative and caring. At Starbucks, we work as one family striving for a common goal. The most hard part of working at Starbucks is the work pressure that requires utmost customer care at all times. The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks is that we have a lot of opportunities to enjoy ourselves as one team."
good,"Could be a great place to work at with the right Starbucks Partners. Gets hard during rushes. If you love communicating with customers, the job is enjoyable and sometimes can make a bad day good."
good,"Great place to work in college, it really worked with my hours for class. it was a great place to learn customer service as well. i moved to a a different store to help open which was great for my learning and skill"
good,"Fun workplace with good team. Good management with thoughts in mind of its employees. "
good,"The hours are very flexible, you learn so much about coffee and tea  which is exciting and interesting."
good,Working at Starbucks showed me that the customer experience goes well beyond a cup of coffee. Being engaged with the customer helps build a friend maybe outside of work.
good,"I like Starbucks' working environment and partner culture. Everyone is friendly, helps each other, and learns and progresses. Clear division of labour and tacit understanding between partners are the basis for efficient and high-quality work. I have become more and more interested in coffee at work and have learned more about coffee. Providing every cup of coffee with my heart made me meet many customers and became friends. The most interesting is the regular coffee lectures, which can talk to many people who love life and love coffee."
good,"love being a barista, some of your co workers are not as nice and tend to let their position go tho their head. and the shifts pick and choose who they want where and are unfair about it"
good,"Fast paced work environment, full of good times and bad. Management was stellar (at my store), and for the most part easy to get along with the other members. It was sometimes difficult to keep up with certain partners who were solely ""times"" driven, or just trying to get drinks and food out as fast as possible without connecting to any of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the relationships with my other baristas -- not to mention that making the drinks is a blast, too."
good,I would definitely work there again. Everyone is fun depending location . Very professional talking is a must go for it. No gross people is nice and coffee
good,"Days go by quickly, and at times can even be fun if you work with the right people. The work can be competitive in little ways but not always enjoyable. Like many jobs in food service, you rick the chance of people constantly complaining, having an issue with company policy and just simply trying to get things for free."
good,It's a good job worth the time the only problem was management and consistency. There are alot of great benefits that are available but you have to be willing to deal with other coworkers antics if the manager isn't willing.
good,"As a working student that solely supported myself, I needed more supplement than I was given. Other than the pay, I loved everything about working for Starbucks. The atmosphere and my partners were great."
good,"Everyone who works at Starbucks, works as a team. It is filled with individuals who will become your greatest friend(s) and you are in an environment where you can progress and feel comfortable in all situations."
good,Lots of hiring and management change but good place to work and lots of room for a promotion. Flexible scheduling and lots of benefits with employment.
good,"Good overall, got a new manager towards the end of my time there hardest part was when there would be only 2 people working one super-visor and one barista towards closing, I enjoyed the customers & local people."
good,"I met the most amazing people through my Journey at Starbucks and appreciated ALL opportunities I had through my years working with the Company. However, the upper management (through my experience was extremely poor and didn't have the proper training) Management was always hired from the outside and thrown in without proper training and knowledge materials."
good,I worked in three stores & was a shift supervisor for one year year at one location. The company is great about promoting from within. Starbucks partners have a ton of resources for personal/professional growth. Partners have a lot of benefits available and the tuition reimbursement program is a great resource that should be used more. Training is unevenly distributed depending on the store manager but the training Starbucks Corp prepares is constantly evolving and thorough.
good,"At times, work can be difficult but when given the time and resources, interacting with customers was one of the most rewarding experiences I had during my tenure."
good,"Very fun workplace, amazing benefits and always room to develop within. Flexible hours if needed. It can be extremely stressful at times depending on how well staffed store is and how experienced partners are. But other than that amazing mission an Amazing company to work for"
good,Overall every company has it's problems with management because everyone has a different style and not all employees are compatible. I learned so much from my time at Starbucks and appreciate that very much.
good,I worked there for 7 years and I was happy to work there until I realized it wasn’t what I wanted to do anymore. The job itself is not hard just very fast pace and customers will difficult at times but as with any job. The benefits are amazing and probably are what kept me there so long.
good,"Le Starbucks est une très belle entreprise qui prône le bien-être de ses employés. Toutefois, je crois qu'il y a un gros travail à faire sur la promotion à l'interne et le potentiel des gens qui travaillent déjà pour l'entreprise."
good,"Starbucks is definitely not the worst place to work. It pays well, has amazing benefits, you get to meet lots of people, and for the most part, the employees are pretty chill. But you're dealing with people literally all day. And you have to be nice and compliant because one bad Yelp review and it's all downhill..."
good,"Starbucks has great benefits for its employees, even part-timers. Health and stock benfits as well as tuition in some subjects. Good job for college students. Volunteering and community outreach opportunites."
good,"I learned a lot working at Starbucks with Hms Host, I learned not only about the company itself but I learned a lot of communication skills. Also working here helped me understand people a lot more since I was Shift Lead and being cashier taught me a lot."
good,The company provides some good benefits. Retail store level commitment to company mission and standards varies based on the management thereof. The day-to-day work is challenging and fulfilling.
good,"As a shift you are responsible for three things: customer experience, partner experience, and facility management. "
good,Very busy yet fun environment to work in. The management is great and co-workers are very laid back and easy to get along with.The customres are always happy and look forward to coming into the store. From working in this company I have learned more about connection and interaction with people along with accuracy and quality of the company products that served.
good,"While working at starbucks the people were helpful and good teachers. There was always somethingyou could be doing too stay busy at a slow portion of the day. It was also fast pace, and had a steep learning curve."
good,"As long as you can do at least 16 hours a week, they will try their best to work with your schedule. They also have an option to do an online college that they’re associated with; little to no tuition paid by pocket if applicable"
good,Benefits and training are second to none.  The management has changed over time but overall same experience.  The experience was invaluable and has helped with every other job I have attained.
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a great company to work for. They really care about their partners and you can receive great benefits. However, it's a high turnover job so be prepared for 1/2 of the staff to either be new or not as knowledgeable. As someone who was Barista Trainer we use to be given 2 weeks to train, but now its only 3 days. This leads to new people feeling unprepared and overwhelmed at the beginning"
good,I liked working there. Will definitely get hours. Long year staffing made it hard for new incoming manager. Overall the company has good benefits and training procedure. Will definitely learn a lot within company.
good,"Starbucks was my beginning of my barista journey. I was introduced sufficient coffee knowledge that I was able to use later in my Barista career. Also, I love how welcoming the company was!"
good,"I had opportunities to learn new drinks, meet people. Too long hours and too much expected of my personal time.  Good benefits.  Stock options is great."
good,Some days are extremely intense. Amazing if you need a job with great benefits. Be prepared to always work hard. try to continuously work on your speed to keep up with demand. You grow close to your co-workers. You will love small little things that make it hard to leave. upper management is forever cracking down on you.
good,"During my time at Starbucks, I learned a lot of good skills including customer service, sales, leadership, and more, I also gained a lot of good friends while working here, baristas are some of the coolest people you'll ever meet."
good,"I like the ambient , company workers , good treat to employees , it is fun cause your never know what will happen to u on Starbucks , it smells good the Pat is good , i just can be in string to much !"
good,"Management was good, they were very flexible and very proud to help everyone out. Co workers were mostly understanding to emergencies and always had good team cohesion."
good,"Starbucks is a great company with amazing benefits. They are really good about working with your schedule, especially if you are a student. The hours can be long, especially while standing on your feet for 8 hours straight. It is very fast paced and can be extremely stressful. However, Starbucks is very good about giving you the hours that you want. The shifts are quite demanding being that a shift requires you to be at work for 4:30am and then work until 1 or 2 in the afternoon."
good,"The typical day at work is ensuring that every machine we use to make our job easier, is up and running. My partners are happy, as I managed the floor, their roles and positions, and ran their breaks. I made sure the service we provided for our customers were to Starbucks standard, all with a welcoming smile. "
good,"I really enjoy working at Starbucks. I have fun, and my coworkers are pretty great. I'm working at a new store, and our store manager is pretty new, so he's working on a bit of a learning curve."
good,"Dobra praca na początek kariery"
good,Starbucks was a great stepping stone in my life. I met tons of amazing people and made tons of great connections in and outside of the coffee business. I would highly recommend it for those who are looking into getting a first time job or even just a second job.
good,I love it at Starbucks they are all nice and sweet. They help pay for school as well. As long as your part time you can get full befits. Everyone I work with is sweet and loving its like a second home. I love all my bosses and they are understanding.
good,My job at Starbucks was fun more than anything. I made many friends that were not just coworkers. Ithe helped me develope customer service skills that helped me connect with people in and out of work.
good,"Barista is a great job if you don't mind being on your feet all day, enjoy creating beverages for customers to enjoy, and are a social person. Job tasks might vary from making beverages, cleaning the cafe and bathrooms, manning the register, stocking shelves, doing dishes in the back. I worked at several stores and all were pretty flexible in terms of time of day worked, usually had at least 2 days off. Some stores were better than others at giving 40 hours per week if you wanted it (some people want less due to school or other commitments). Tips vary between stores/area of town as well. I enjoyed the fast paced, social environment. I did not enjoy the low pay - in terms of fast food it is good, but you cannot support yourself off of it. Benefits were great, inexpensive health care was much appreciated! If you don't like standing up for 8 hours, or dealing with sometimes grumpy people, this is probably not a job for you. I worked with some great managers who made me feel appreciated, and some who were so terrible I transferred stores to get away. I experienced them promoting outsiders over tenured partners, which was disappointing to see."
good,"Starbucks was a crazy and amazing place to work.  I always felt welcome and appreciated there.  Even before working there, I would spend a good amount of my time there because I loved the atmosphere, vibe, and partners so much (I don't even drink coffee).  Customers can get on your nerves a lot, but you always have your regulars and your partners to help cheer you up and make the moment right for you."
good,"Starbucks was an excellent place to work, but it just wasn't where I wanted to develop! I started off as a Barista in high school, just looking for something flexible and stimulating to the mind. It was a fun, fast paced environment. Within a year I was promoted to Shift Supervisor, it was an easy transition for someone like myself who knew the ethic of what starbucks had upheld itself too, so for anyone who can maintain that and is looking to grow Starbucks would be a good place to look into! It is very stressful at times, from grouchy morning people, complicated drinks, time management, etc. The job can feel like a lot at times, but once you work there for at least 2 months, I would say you just become immune to things like that. (some days are better than others!) I had quite a few altercations within management, from supervisors to district managers. I come from a family of strong leaders, and have a good view on what it means to be a good leader, and let's just say some were better than others. I think this would be a good job for anyone who enjoys coffee, a fast pace work environment, and is looking for a flexible schedule."
good,It was a privilege to have been worjed in such world's best coffee brand where you learn so much and become very skilled. Great opportunity for career advancement.
good,Great place to grow and go to school. I was able to become more responsible and hold a level of respect with my peers. Most of us went to college and the hours at Starbucks allowed us to do so.
good,"Fun, slightly overwhelming during rush hour. great benefits, room to grow, management was good, had to relocate if not  I would have stayed. part time barista, enjoyed learning to make  the different drinks"
good,"overall, i enjoyed my time working at Starbucks. This is because i made new friends, the pay was good and the manager was excellent.  I stopped working there, because i wanted to concentrate on my study's. As i have entered my final year of sixth form, I have more time to participate in other things. For example, applying for a job and working."
good,Starbucks was a geat place to learn how to work in a fast-paced environment while working with vigor and fervency. It enabled me to connect on a different level with customers as I worked diligently to make their experience great. It energized me to focus on enhancing the way I served others and brought clarity to why people are most important.
good,Regulars are very nice and you get to see a lot of different people every day. Very fast paced and not too much downtime. Management at my specific store wasn't all that good.
good,"Starbucks is a fun fast-paced place to work; however, it can take a lot out of you.  Definitely a good part time job while in school!  Free coffee and one free meal a day!"
good,"I had a pretty great time with starbucks. the team is amazing for the most part and theres really no one that DOESNT want to work at starbucks that works there. It's not treated like a typical fast food restaurant or anything. It tries it's best to give customers and barista's that true cafe feel. Every drink is treated with care (or is at least is meant to be) and I loved the managers who did their best to stay on top of things. "
good,es una empresa.pero ya no hay crecimientos como antes
good,Great fun place to work. They take care of their employees. Easy and enjoyable job. Hours stayed pretty consistent. Worked around second job and school schedule.
good,Starbucks is an amazing company. Sadly my store manager was not equipped with the starbucks ethics. Gave amazing advancement opportunities as well as knowledge on inventory tracking and customer service knowledge. Always short staffed and over worked. Would like a less physically demanding job.
good,"Sometimes you get lucky and work with very amazing people, sometimes, not so much, but it was never boring! The experience working there was something I will always remember."
good,The right store can become like a family. It takes team players who are willing to pick up/cover shifts when needed. Who want to improve their store and help things flow smoothly.
good,"Enjoy working with great staff and serving amazing customers! I would highly recommend this job for a HS, College Student through a stay at home mom looking to get back into the workforce!"
good,"Most people know Starbucks is the place to go for coffee and friends, and I worked at one of the busier ones. It’s high stress, but you’ll usually have good friends there and want to come to work. The only eason I quit was because I had a GM who told a hispanic person to ‘learn the language’ and I told him I wasn’t working for him, but otherwise, I would love to go back! 10/10"
good,I worked mostly by myself at a Starbucks inside of Randalls and I loved it. You get a chance to build relationships with regular customers and the discounts are nice.
good,"if you're a college kid, this is for you. Personalities can be hard to deal with but everyone needs an income. I was not impressed and choose to leave because even upper management acted like kids"
good,"Honestly a very good job for a college student with a  wide variety of benefits including health, dental, and eye insurance. Moving up in the ranks is often difficult, but it is designed more as a temporary job rather than a permanent job, though that is not out of the realm of possibility."
good,"A typical day at work included setting up the food trays, brewing coffee, and making cold items such as teas and whipped creams before the bar opened. Also, it included making different hot and cold beverages throughout the work shift, tidying up and washing dishes throughout the shift, and ringing up purchases. I learned a lot about time management and how to work in a fast paced environment when it came to people needing their coffee at 8 am in the morning. I also learned how to work with my Starbucks partners and respect them and the customer because of Starbucks' values and mission. The workplace culture was very inspiring because of the way Starbucks welcomes people from all walks of life, the way the company teaches us to respect each other while at the same time respecting the customer. The hardest part of the job was working in the fast paced environment when I first started out. I got better at it with time. Also working nonstop for hours with a 10 minute break was also something that I felt was difficult at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with my partners and with customers that were regulars. Apart from the back breaking work sometimes ahaha, I would always look forward to seeing people's faces and having meaningful conversations every time I went to work."
good,"It’s not just making coffee . It’s making connections with people and education them about the product , very nice work place if you like to learn customer service ."
good,"An amazing job to learn and grow your work skills as an individual. Management is very professional and well trained. The only partly difficult thing is dealing with frustrated customers, but really helped you learn how to connect better with customers."
good,Overall this what a pretty good job. Free coffee nice benefits. Fast paced recieve tips weekly. Fun to make the beverages. Very good job would definitely recommend
good,It was a nice place to work while in school. Flexible with hours and gave time off easily. Allowed you to transfer stores pretty easily as well. The only downside was that Managers changed often.
good,It was stressful high paced work I also did it while I was pregnant with my first child and up until 1 week before delivery. I dont know what else to write I am just writing to take up characters so I can be done with this annoying survey.
good,started working here a month before i left for uni. They gave me my full training and told me theyd keep me on the pay roll so i can return during the holidays. Everyone is so lovley including both staff and customers.
good,"Worked for over four years and was always supportive of the company. Great benefits and flexible work schedules. However, can be a high stress environment. Depending on the store, managers can make or break the store and work culture."
good,"Working with starbucks was an awesome experience.  Everyday you learned something new, and everyday there was something to do.  Working with this company helped me learn how to stay busy while working, and helped me with other things in my day to day life."
good,"When you work hard it pays off with being consider, But if you have a family and your trying to make ends meet and your trying  to advance within 6month than you have to double your income if job is not allowing you to be financially be stable. Most likely you will have  work two or more jobs."
good,"Fun environment, spirited people. Loved making the drinks and chatting with customers. The hours were long for example 630am to 230 pm. Only downside, a lot of wasted food."
good,When I worked at Starbucks I was mostly always put on bar section because I was able to multitask and customers were happy with the service I would provide for them.
good,"I loved my job at Starbucks. This is a great company to work for with many benefits and opportunities. I had the misfortune of working at a poorly managed establishment. With a great manager, you can achieve great things."
good,Working at Starbucks in the Fresh Meadows location was a very fast paced and it was one of the busiest Starbucks in the company. At the time I was working there it was very relaxed and stress free. The hours were flexible since I was a college student as well.
good,Great seasonal job and the company cares about their employees. You get to learn about different blends of coffee and where it comes from and how it’s made.
good,"Overall I loved working for Starbucks. I developed really close relationships with my coworkers and even the customers. You become like a family with everyone in that environment so you learn to work as a tram player. Hours are generally okay but there are slow seasons where your hours will get cut without you having any say so, but that is with a lot of jobs. I learned majority of my work skills from this company, they teach you a lot."
good,Very fast paced and physically challenging. Had to deal with many high strung picky customers. Great co-workers and environment to work. Felt like management really cared about the job and the workers. Great friendly competition between workers.
good,"I had my issues working there, but ultimately, it's a good company. They hired me at 16 years old when nobody else would, and they gave me a chance. Working in a NYC Manhattan location was just crazy, though. This was years ago, so I hope they have reinvigorated the management and cut down on the shady tactics they used to use back then."
good,Really enjoyed my time and made friends but can be very demanding at times especially because it was understaffed and management seemed to make it more of a hassle to work there with them.
good,An excellent working environment with good communication and learning phase with the employer and employees. Friendly colleagues with good relationship between employers and employees
good,Best company I have worked for to date. They really care about their employees and only want the best for eveyone. The employees should be gettting paid a little more than what is currently being paid.
good,good company to work for if you are a student. They have flexible hours and great benefits. The environment is fast paced if you work in a high volume location.
good,I had a great time working at Starbucks. They were always reasonable with hours and pay. It was easy to get promoted when i was working for Starbucks.
good,"Compensation was great, leadership above my role as store manager was hard to rely on. You run your own business, yes, but there were times when your ship was left to float until you either sank or found lifeboats. The atmosphere was fun and inviting, and there is room for growth."
good,Sometimes you luck out and end up working with the best people you could ever meet. It's usually the work load that comes with promotion days or holidays that are the hardest.
good,Loved working with Starbucks as they know mostly how to treat there partners. Shame they brought in tougher sales focused higher managers who didn't understand the people side of the business.
good,"Starbucks was a great job for me to get by and gain experience. Not only did I learn to work as a team and calmly work under pressure, but I also gained many social skills communicating with all types of people. The job is very fast paced especially in the Flushing location that I work at, so I am no stranger to pressure. There were many benefits that came from the job such as discounts and free coffee!"
good,"i loved working here, wish pay was more. There is no way someone could live in Orange County with their pay. Everyone was friendly, obviously not everyone will get along but for the most part work environment was good. There were always issues with homeless people coming into the store."
good,a typical day working for starbucks depending on the location it can be slow or very busy and non stop. i learned how to multitask and deal with bad attitudes from customers while keeping a smile on my face as well as leading a large team to sucess. the hardest thing fro me sometimes was remaining professional while dealing with a rude customer what i loved the most about the company is the relationships built between customers and partners
good,"This company cares about the employees in the way that I was guaranteed to get a break, all the rules were followed, and employees' rights were very well respected. We were worked very hard, cleaning was intense but necessary, it was organized but management expected us as the entry level workers to solve all the problems that they had to deal with."
good,My starbucks experience though with hiccups of normal understaffing or scheduling every once in a while is amazing so far. I love my coworkers and the environment I am in makes it really easy to come to work.
good,The most fun was being able to taste all the drinks and food or make your own drinks and food. But the managers weren't all that great. Didn't keep good communication with everyone and it was hard to get ahold of one when you needed it. Of course there is always drama but put that aside and the job wasn't hard
good,"My experience at the Kroger Starbucks that I was employed at was a mostly positive one. Although that branch didn't provide most of the usual benefits, the workplace was lots of fun and being a Barista is really enjoyable. However, the branch was poorly managed, and the manager would change shifts without notifying employees, ignore requests for days off far in advance, and forget to order low inventory items."
good,The hardest part of the job is to serve costumers. People do not understand why their order may take longer than they want and blame Starbucks workers for that. The most enjoyable part of the job is to communicate with colleagues because they are all welcoming and funny to talk to.
good,Starbucks is a great company that supports all kinds or people and organizations. This company is involved in community events and has great benefits.
good,"I love working at Starbucks. I love my coworkers which makes it hard for me to want to switch to another location. Unfortunately, I don’t get paid enough to live off of in my area. We thought we were going to get raises this year, but I guess that didn’t happen. I don’t want to leave, but I really need higher pay. Overall, I still recommend working here as the environment is very uplifting and fun"
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for while I was pursuing my undergrad degree. The flexibility of the hours meant I could be in school, intern and have an income. Having benefits through Starbucks was also amazing!"
good,"Starbucks can be a really good job for someone's first job, or a job to work while going to college or to go to college through their college program. But it can be very taxing, and does take a lot of patience and is a forever fast pace environment."
good,"I had a really bad experience with my manager my last year as a partner  so I chose to take a leave of absence, ended up never returning. As a company though this is a good place to work if you like working in a fast paced environment and working with people"
good,The culture was beautiful and I loved working in a fast-paced environment. It was never a struggle changing my availability or making the job fun as long as the managers are willing to make work enjoyable.
good,I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. I met extraordinary people and learned how to work as a team.
good,"Each day is a tough hard working day but work is never easy and that is what was good about working for Starbucks, always was kept on my feet accomplishing something giving me a good sense of accomplishment. It is a very physically demanding job but worth it with the number of hours put in and the amount the paycheck comes out to."
good,"I had a wonderful experience with a Starbucks in a small neighbourhood, and one terrible experience at a very busy one in a chapters with a hostile manager. Please be selective about which cafe you choose to work at."
good,Overall it was a great company to work for but as long as you have a good manager the job will be worth it. what i loved the most was that time went by fast and there is always something to do. Bad side is sometimes you don't always get your breaks.
good,"Drive through locations are high stress."
good,Its a great place to work and its good when your in school. If your not a fan of school for at Starbuck it an promote in the company and you can find yourself making good money.
good,Customers can be tedious and excessive at times and some just simply awful managers slip through the cracks of Starbucks' overall company  but for the most part it's a great company with wonderful benefits and compensation through all means. One thing I will say is that the turnover rate is overwhelming.
good,"I’ve worked at starbucks for almost a year, and moved up quite quick in the company. A very gossipy industry, but if you are able to work past that- it’s a great environment. Conflicts tend to get resolved on a one-sided basis, so it easier to work through them without a superior. :) Free drinks are awesome, and the customers are generally pretty great! starbucks is a great company, and I recommend at least trying it! :) (also, pay raises every 6 months and that’s always a plus)"
good,"Very fun place to work, but be ready to face demanding customers that want their orders to be ready 5 minutes before their place an order. Lots of cleaning involved as well, so don't even bother to buy gym membership."
good,"This company really focuses on the partners and taking care of one another. They offer amazing insurance, 401k, and stock benefits just with working a minimum of 20 hours a week."
good,"A good start to a career, opportunity to progress, meet people and build relationships. Wages have always been competitive compared to other Coffee retailers."
good,"A lot of food and beverage work including making drinks, helping customers pay, and cleaning and maintaining the store. But remember that each store is regional, so each one has its own personality that comes with that specific group of staff, supply to store, and customer base depending on location."
good,"Trabajo estable, con personas dispuesta a ayudarte en lo que se necesite, gerentes y administradores muy atentos."
good,The company as a whole is truly wonderful. They care greatly for all their customers and employees. As with any job there are god store managers and there are bad ones as well.
good,"O Starbucks foi uma experiência que tive fora do país, portanto, em sua avaliação deve-se considerar as diferenças culturais que permeavam o ambiente."
good,"I love working with people, they have many opportunities for advancement. Management could have been better but good overall. I made many friends and loved making and drinking coffee all day!"
good,"Its cool to learn to be fast and to keep doing staff, also the management is usually nice even thought we are full of task to fulfill all the time, good experience."
good,"bonne entreprise, perspectives d'évolutions intéressantes."
good,"Shifts went by very quick due to the high volume."
good,"It really was a joy coming into work every day. I felt I was contributing to an environment that really fed into the human spirit. Seeing repeat customers gave me pride, and working at Starbucks was truly a rewarding experience. The culture and workplace really were heartwarming when it came to the environment that the store provided. The hardest part of the job was usually the brief rush that we would experience during certain hours, though it was never enough to make me dislike my work experience. I learned that remembering the customer's name, and engaging them in conversation was the best way to satisfy a customer who may have had to wait a minute during rush hour to get their drinks. Which ended up working out since I became friends with such amazing, diverse people! This was the most enjoyable part of the job as well aside from making drinks, which I found to be very fun and fulfilling. You can tell a lot about each individual by their unique drink choices, and sometimes, introduce them to something entirely new and delicious! I really loved being a Barista at Starbucks and would love to do so again."
good,"It is a very fast paced environment that requires more skill than people expect coming into the job. Be ready to constantly be moving. There is also a major learning curve with how to make all of the drinks. Starbucks is a company with notoriously good benefits but in recent years they have been setting more unrealistic, unachievable expectations on their baristas and has come to be extremely stressful in even the best of us."
good,"if you work hard advancement in the company can be obtained but there were some downsides. constantly changing schedules and systems of operation. management had to adhere to scheduling mechanisms not necessarily based on a store specific need. at times i missed breaks and lunches due to customer needs and lack of employees. overall a good company to work for with great benefits, but need to work out kinks in the system on a store by store basis and the needs of each specific store."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time working for Starbucks Coffee Company. Our store displayed a lot of professionalism and proper treatment of partners staff members. I strongly recommend this job to others.
good,Hours are sometimes cut too short at my store but love the work I do as a barista. Amazing benefits and very friendly co workers. Wage is pretty good and a really relaxed uniform.
good,"I learned how to make beverages, become an outgoing person, and getting to know regular customers is my favorite part about this job. After working at multiple different Starbucks stores I've come to realize there's many cliques."
good,"I learned patience and how to multitask better, the management was great and very cooperative and helpful I really love the co workers and the rush of making everyones day better with coffee"
good,"Like any job in retail, it depends on your team. Personally I quite enjoyed my time at Starbucks. It's definitely worth a try. Also if you work full-time you get benefits"
good,"Starbucks kept you on your toes. Always things to do and always budgets to maintain. Starbucks has great benefits, from 401K to stock options. Health benefits are most important factor to a lot of people."
good,"I learned how to properly connect with customers."
good,"I really like the team aspect of working with Starbucks, as I am able to learn from each shift that I work and use that experience to educate the partners I work with."
good,"The manager I worked under was basically legendary, I learned that I need to not over extend my self with a commute, and I learned how quickly a workplace culture can turn on you if the favorite doesn't like you. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people who would come through the door."
good,"Starbucks is a fun company to work at with good environments, and promotes team building. It's fast paced, challenging, yet rewarding. Getting to know your customers and colleagues was the best part of the job, right next to learning about the coffee itself. Luckily it's a coffee shop, as sometimes the hours that can be worked are incredibly early."
good,"Starbucks is a great transient job. Typically always hiring, and a great company to learn/hone communication skills, customer service, and the importance of teamwork."
good,"Dont get involved in the gossip. Try to stick to yourself and do your job, if your patient the rest will come to you benefits are spectacular the hours just arent good"
good,It's a great place to work to gain experience and get benefits.  Customer service skills are really applied and needed if you're wanting to get good tips.
good,"Fast paced environment, needs better training, needs better pay, needs new equipment, however I do enjoy the people I work with but at times we all feel overworked, management needs to be a little more understanding"
good,"Starbucks is a very fast-paced environment but with training, it is easy to catch on. It is very enjoyable to learn how to make numerous drinks and discover the new recipes that are customized to each individual. Overall a great place to work!"
good,"Great place to work for a typical day involved making drinks and working as a team, got to learn a lot about drinks and the workplace was amazing.  The hardest part is standing up for many hours and the most enjoyable part was helping people and bringing a smile to their face."
good,Working for the company over all was a great experience. Although the district that i worked in was very hectic and was not run correctly. Personal vendettas and issues got in the way of day to day business.
good,I think Starbucks program for people in college I really great! Management was nice and extremely understanding and supportive when I had a family member pass away.
good,"Great place to work "
good,"It was nice being a supportive part of the community, You got to know people by name and try and make a positive impact on someones day. It was a nice environment"
good,"At the time of me writing this, I've worked for the company for almost 3 years. I didn't know anything about coffee but that didn't matter. The hiring manager liked my positive attitude and thus I was hired. It isn't my first job, and have had different managers with different work ethics. The overall environment is friendly, and can get uncomfortable at times, but it's like that everywhere. It's my easiest job so far, and the one that has paid the most. The benefits and schedule flexibility are why I've lasted this long if I must be honest. I recommend this company to young adults looking to get a good experience in customer service that is rivaled only by chik-fil-a."
good,"A typical day as a Starbuck's Barista under 18 (at the time) consisted of being on the tills for the majority of the shift, this meant I could interact with customers one-to-one, yet also gain knowledge into cash handling and proper customer service. I learned many things while in employment here such as people skills, such as confidence and politeness; I further learned how to work in a café in such situations as serving drinks, cleaning up and preparing food. The management in this workplace was rather biased in my opinion, there were certainly favoured employees. However, there was a good environment to get to know colleagues and regulars in the shop. The hardest part of the job at this time was my age (17) being in the way of me making hot drinks and using the bar area - this meant that I was on the till a lot and therefore had to be the face of the café. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of knowing that you have made people happy by having a positive attitude and giving them what they desired from the establishment."
good,Working at Starbucks is definitely a fun environment as long as management is effective. They offer many benefits and help employees grow in their careers.
good,"I had a good time there. The hours were flexible, and the manager was understanding. The free meal and coffee was a nice perk, but you will get sick of both."
good,"No geral a empresa é tudo e mais um pouco. Eles se preocupam co os funcionários do mesmo jeito que se preocupam com os clientes. Os benefícios são bons, tendo convenio médico até seguro de vida, e não posso deixar de fora as grandes oportunidades de crescimento que eles fornecem. Em pouco tempo, você já pode subir de cargo se for competente e amar o que faz."
good,Glad I got to work for this amazing company and learn customer service skills while interaction with a large number of people. Great place for military spouse to work seeing as we will interaction with a community quicker and adapt to an area quicker.
good,"I loved working here! It was fast pace and fun! Free coffee, great tips, and the team was very close knit and fun work with! I learned a lot working there and it helped me in other jobs."
good,Working at Starbucks for 4 years was definitely an important chapter in my life. I enjoyed working with the people I was around and I wished I had taken advantage of all the benefits that I could have while I was there. In the end my decision for leaving was that I was not planning on moving up in the company and I need to start making more money to move out on my own.
good,"I really have enjoyed my time at Starbucks, as my coworkers and I are like a family, and management is great and understanding! However, I do not feel that we get paid enough, nor do I receive enough hours to live on my own."
good,"I did not work for a corporate store but rather a licensed store, so I can't speak for the compensation the Starbucks corporation gives its employees, and while I would love to go into my reasoning for my disappointment with the company that actually paid me, Aramark, this is about the work I did, which from what I understand is similar to working in an actual Starbucks store."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a rewarding experience. I was with the company two separate times, in leadership both times. The corporate culture is one that other companies should look up to and aspire to be more like."
good,A good job to work all around. There is a considerable amount of what I would deem job security in terms of 401k plans and the ability to advance within the company.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a lot of fun and you get free coffee and free food. The people are friendly and the schedules are very flexible. You get to meet new people everyday and you make relationships with ""regulars"""
good,"Its a great multi-tasking work facility. "
good,"fast paced environment friendly customers only open from Monday to Friday so it leaves room for a well balanced home/work life"
good,"Great company overall. Really do research on your store and manager before you start, the store makes your experience. You have to be thick skinned tho, great benefits for part time and full time, you get raises every year"
good,"I was challenged everyday to do something new, there was never a dull moment or a time where I couldn't improve something about my work ethic or more. It is a very fast paced store that brings in a lot of competition. I loved the interactions with customers and getting to know them on a personal level, that was always an important part of my job."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks. I liked working in a fast-paced environment and making great coffee and food for guest that arrived at the story. The pay was also not too bad.
good,In this company nice workplace culture and The enjoyable part of the company send to all team on outings. In Starbucks we connect with customers personally.
good,I work at a licensed Starbucks owned by my University so I can not speak for corporate but I have enjoyed working there.  It is a good part-time job for students.  I started as a barista and have since been promoted to a supervisor.  I am not payed the Starbucks wage though but I am payed by my university which pays more than corporate.  This job has really helped my people skills.
good,"Starbucks is a great place for students to work. The hours are flexible, and you get free coffee while you work. I saved lots of money from the weekly markout program-you get to take home a pound of coffee beans or a tin of tea for free."
good,"If you can wake up early then Starbucks may be calling your name. Well, if you are just know that just as you arose early so did all your customers. Beware of the beastly instincts of your average coffee addict when you're preparing drinks at the crack of dawn. The rest of your time at Starbucks is relatively relaxed."
good,"This job at Starbucks have been great. I learned a lot of work ethic, I am appreciated and the management takes their time out to notice each worker. The pay in Connecticut is four dollars less than my last pay in New York. I would like a job in my field as a recent undergraduate in digital arts and graphic design. Thank you."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work especially for a first time job. The benefits are amazing and the discounts are awesome as well. You learn to multitask which stays with you for the rest of your life.
good,"There was constant work to be done while on shift at Starbucks, which kept me busy and ensured constant productivity while at work, the workplace environment was always positive and I enjoyed working with all of my co workers, there was a decent amount of pressure from management to be accurate while maintaining a fast pace which resulted in some stress at times but nothing that was unbearable."
good,"It is a part-time job offered by my school in a license Starbucks store, a lot of teamwork and multitasking. I am really enjoying making drinks and get to know the people in the neighborhood. Such a great memory."
good,"I came into this work desperate, I was changing careers, needed to go back to school, and the location was 2 blocks away from my house. The culture here was shockingly supportive, all my coworkers have big goals, my manager knows that this stage in my life is temporary and always kept those visions a priority. Because of all this, I have a crazy flexible schedule, no pressure to maintain fixed hours, and it's easy to keep your dream alive because you can talk about it openly. Even in school, I still get enough hours to get all the amazing benefits Starbucks provides. Health, Dental, even 401k. Of course, it's fast paced work (dependent of area) and the pay doesn't really reflect the amount of fatigue you experience but you always have options. All in all it's been a great transition job for me and I would recommend it to anyone."
good,"Great benefits, flexible hours, good pay,hardest part of the job is dealing with the diverse group of people that come through every day. Management at my last two stores I worked at needs more training"
good,"fairly fast paced environment, must be able to multi-task well, don't take everything personally"
good,The job may be a bit stressful at times especially in high-volume stores but the people you work with make all the difference. Teach and elevate your partners and it will make your job so much easier.
good,Starbucks was my favorite job as someone who enjoys being busy and socializing. The management was very professional and organized and I never had any trouble with payroll.
good,The job required a lot of the work but it was very satisfying. The joy you get to see from peoples smiles enjoying their drink or eating their pastry. The workplace culture was great because everyone bought into the idea of us being a family and helping each other even though they didn't need to.
good,I loved working here because I always felt valued and important to the company and to my store and manager. As with any company getting along with all coworkers is not given but worked for in some cases. This company allowed me to grow personally and within the company of course.
good,"I worked at a Starbucks location for about 6 months. As a part time job, I wouldn't recommend it because getting hours is tough, but as a full time job it can be very rewarding. However, if you want to work in a laid-back environment, this may not be the place for you. Because of the company's size, it is incredibly standardized and there is only one way to do every task. This, however, does make the job very predictable."
good,"Working at Starbucks helped me hone my customer service skills. My supervisors and manager were always hands-on and they continuously train us every day."
good,"I work at Starbucks when I was in highschool, it was extremely flexibable with my school and my sports. they paid weekly and gave me tips which meant I alwasy had some type of cash on me."
good,"its a great job but at the cost of you having to go above and beyond cause its always packed and they expect you to be done in seconds basically, you have to go the extra mile but the benefits and pay make up for it, especially benefits"
good,Very difficult to find a healthy work/life balance working all different shifts. Very good company for young adults looking to get their college degree while also having health benefits.
good,"Starbucks is a great company. I have the opportunity to work with a diversity cliente. Everyday I learn something new, rather its a new language, or even a new customer. I enjoy Starbucks and I would recommend it to anyone, who's willing to learn and grow."
good,"Starbucks was a job that was fun, and where I got to meet a lot of amazing people. Made awesome connections and I would love to work for a company like Starbucks again."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of regulars we knew by name and order, mass chaos after classes and rare lulls. The fast-pace work environment was stressful but taught me to think on my toes and communicate effectively."
good,"I worked there during my freshman year of college. It was a good part time job. I enjoyed most of the work day, it was challenging and fast paced. My coworkers were great and Starbucks provided great benefits."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for over a year, its awesome. Its stressful at first and its not so easy at first but overtime, its so fluent and everything becomes smooth. Theres allot of awesome benefits, get to choose your own hours as well:)"
good,"Starbucks is a fun environment with many tools to grow, develop, and advance in your role or to the next. I have learned more than enough from Starbucks about leading and managing and creating cultures within our stores. I enjoy every minute of work and my team."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at Starbucks. I enjoyed the fast-paced nature and the challenge of remembering drink recipes and the opportunities to advance. The company cares about its employees.
good,My first couple years were stressful but fun! This job requires more effort than a typical job but the benefits and work environment makes up for such a busy job. Scheduling is typically very flexible and I have learned how to multi-task more efficiently.
good,I feel there isn’t aloways a consistency when it comes to people hired. Sometimes the managers can be great but others aren’t. Recently the job has become more stressful for many of the partners because of the understaffing
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for. They care about the needs of their employees by providing health care starting at 20hr/week and profit sharing.
good,"Your fellow partners and some of the regulars are the best part of the job. Management is more about speed and numbers than quality and craft. However, the day can be fun and downtime can be spent practicing latte art or pairing coffee and food. It's a perfect job for anyone in college."
good,"I worked in the Drive Thru starbucks at Kahala, and it was a really fun environment. I learned a lot, and it was my first supervisor job. I got along really well with my coworkers and they were some of the best people I've met. The only thing was that the Drive Thru is really high paced and a little high stress so I'd only recommend this to someone who likes to constantly be moving around."
good,"My typical day at work consisted of cleaning, preparing beverages, and interacting with customers. The management varies depending on the location of your store, and which store you work at. The most enjoyable part of my job was probably interacting with my coworkers, I feel Starbucks hires genuinely good people for the most part. The hardest part of the job varied on the day and people you encounter."
good,Quick paced environment with varying duties. I learned to be a team player and take jobs that others did not enjoy to make the workplace a better environment. Management was a bit lousy as there were many changes happening in the store. Hardest part was working with people who did not execute their job properly and with integrity. I loved the friendships I made and the lessons I learned while working there.
good,I really enjoyed working here & had the opportunity to experience great diversity. Also Starbucks was my first job and it was amazing it will always hold a place in my heart.
good,"Payed above minimum wage, which was a huge plus for me and my coworkers, but not much opportunity to get more. You could apply to be a shift supervisor, but the boost in pay is insignificant. Good temporary or summer job."
good,"Amazing colleagues and customers, really gives you a chance to connect with people on a daily basis. Of course it depends on the manager but is usually a fun high energy workplace. Gives you the opportunity to work on leadership skills, customer service skills and become a barista."
good,A typical shift lasted about 6 hours; if you worked with the right people the energy was great. Waking up at 4am to open was rough but the benefits honestly made it worth it.
good,"Overall good company, overall good culture.  Senior Management would benefit from letting their teams lead and not dictating directives top down.  They could also take their queue from Amazon and fire ineffective workers instead of letting them stay on for decades.  Other than that, a good experience."
good,"Enjoyable work experience on most days and most customers were pleasant, especially the regulars. Everyone works together to create a great experience and have fun."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to start and learn many different useful skills. If management is what you seek, then know it is obtainable given you have the capacity."
good,"It is a wonderful place to learn how to provide exceptional customer service. Starbucks really does a have a great mission and values both customers and partners. It does require a lot of physical labor which means there is a lot of hard work. Our store has very high standards when it comes to service and cleanliness. This takes a lot of work to maintain. Overall, our manager does listen to our concerns and works with our schedules. It is quite fun at times and quite fast paced."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the day is usually the people you work around with. there will be days where customer can be a little to crazy, but that comes with the job. Great job to be honest."
good,"Day went by pretty quickly since there were always customers to keep us busy. Management was ok, not great. She didn't really know how to speak to employees appropriately. Hardest part of the job was shipment day. Took about 4-6 hours to organize, date dot, and put away entire inventory. Most enjoyable part of the job was our regular customers."
good,"Can be difficult at times dealing with the GP, and learning a multitude of different beverages, but was fun and worth my time working there! Great managment, and great staff!"
good,Starbucks was a great job I had a lot of fun working my only major problem was that management was practically invincible even after several complaints to the district manager
good,it was cool job to work. The people are the most fun group of people you will ever work for. If you enjoy helping customers this is this is the  job for you.
good,It’s a good high school job for students. Their hours are very flexible they work with you and do their best to keep their customer last and employees happy.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work and affords a vast amount of beneifts.  The worst part of the job is the entitled customers you have to deal with and the cut in labor.  Some days it feels like you're expected to do the work of 2-3 people.
good,"Good job for college students, the hours are flexible enough that you can take a full course load and still work part time.  Stores are often understaffed which are stressful."
good,"Fun place to work, able to received health benefits with short hours - not too common among employers.  Close location to home, flexible hours and shifts."
good,I really do enjoy working for Starbucks. The ever changing menu and customizing really help keep you on your toes. The district Manager is always available to help out and keeping you informed.
good,All my coworkers and I got along really well and we had really good communication. All the custumers were for the most part friendly and gave us good tips.
good,I did not ever think Starbucks would be a place that I could brag on but this company is a great company to work for. The benefits were great and full benefits for part time employees was so beneficial. If could get back on with them I probably would. I miss the relationships built with customers and staff that I worked with. One of my most favorite places to work!!!
good,"long hours on your feet. This is a very busy location, located right off the service road and the main drag!"
good,"Shifts at Starbucks can be a little inconsistent but can easily be arranged around your schedule. I loved working here because the company culture is very friendly and collaborative. I enjoyed working here as it was not only enjoyable and stimulating, but because it taught me a lot about customer service. Highly recommend to students looking for a part-time job!"
good,Starbucks is overall a great company to work for because they provide so many benefits to their employees. If you're interested you have to realize that it is a relatively fast pace jobs because there are multiple rush hours throughout the day. The management is okay for the most part just don't mess up infant of them and pray you don't get scheduled together because it makes everything more stressful. The hardest part about the job is the customers because people are extremely rude when you don't get their coffee as fast a possible.
good,"nice workplace,learn new faces everyday, some people will be nice and fun and some will be rude,nasty,and mean. its a fast pace job but you will get use to it"
good,I would have loved to stay at this company but because it was in target had to leave when they shut down. management was great and always made you feel welcomed
good,"I love meeting new people and personalize there drink to what they like or feel. i love Learning about new drinks everyweek and making them to a perfection. The history and background of how it became such a wonderful company today are amazing. Working as a barista you have to be friendly, energetic, have great customer service and willing to learn to ensure your customer has a great experience."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks as a barista requires you to arrive ready, be attentive to customers and their orders, have a smile and obtain strong interpersonal skills. I learned more about coffee and effective teamwork while I worked at Starbucks. Management was great, while I was there we were assigned a new store manager which was a smooth transition, things did change as to be expected but it was overall good. The most difficult part of the job I would say would be dealing with constant call-offs and no shows which made it difficult to go home if you were sick. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the amazing staff we had. I've worked at several Starbucks locations and one thing you can always count on is a well-rounded and cultured staff that brings many different things to the table."
good,"During my time in starbucks I learned a lot about myself and as an overall person. I had a real family there, genuine people that wanted to see me win as a person, I grew a lot and learned how to work on a more serious note. I learned a lot about respecting others and self respect. Definitely a respectable environment, favorite job thus far."
good,I went to work for Starbucks because I was able to get affordable health care coverage for my family on a part time schedule that worked well for me and my family.
good,Didn't have a great manager at my last location. My first manager was great. Fun and creative work environment. It's really a hit or miss depending on which location you end up at.
good,fast paced teamwork a lot of recipes for each drink there a order of process you ave to go through for each drink customers will be picky and argue about price or if it not made right.
good,"Some longer shifts are physically taxing, but breaks were given pretty often. I learned a lot about coffee and tea. I loved being part of a team with my coworkers and meeting and talking to customers."
good,"I learned how to make many different drinks, both hot and cold, and seasonal. I also learned how to be a cashier and how to use a cash register, and how to handle money when a customer handed it to me."
good,I work in a work study program. Management was excellent. Boss was excellent. Great to study for school but not enough hours. Would recommend any tech student to work there.
good,"Sometimes stressful, but overall enjoyable work environment. Did not feel as if I could make a career out of this job, but I was not looking to. A great manager that was super flexible with hours, but I also struggled with getting hours because they are limited."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks begins with clocking in and figuring out your role for the day. The manager on duty will fill you in on important details of the day and place you in one of several positions on the floor, whether that be front counter, making drinks on bar, stocking and cleaning on customer support, or any other of various tasks. The best part of the job is that your fellow baristas and even management often provides a sense of comradery. You're in this together and can get through the day! The downsides can be that management can have a tendency to be inconsistent on rules. This can make it difficult to know what is expected of you, although is not completely chaos-inducing."
good,Always a fun place to work with a variety of people.  Very customer care oriented.  The hardest part of the job for me was opening so early.  Must be a morning person!
good,"It's a fun environment, but in Midland, TX it isn't enough to live off of unless you are living with your parents. The advancement opportunity is there for hard workers, but the pay for advancement should increase as well."
good,most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new and fun people and having conversations with the customers. the management is always fun and very understanding
good,"Starbucks is certainly an interesting place to work. It quickly becomes a 2nd home for most baristas, simply because of the friendships that you form here (plus the discounts are pretty great). While there is a typical workday -- dictated largely by an abundance of (sometimes unnecessary) procedures -- there's also a lot of day-to-day changes due to customers, local events, and more. It's not easy learning how to make drinks or perform the job admirably, but once you do your muscle memory kicks in and things become easier. That said, there are only 3-4 different positions that a regular barista can claim on any given day. While this is great for people that love a routine, it will quickly become a monotonous and boring hellscape for those who like -- and want -- to mix things up."
good,"I worked in a very fast-paced environment, and It wasn't anything I couldn't handle. My co-workers were great, and we all respected each other. The hardest part of the job was constantly keeping the store in order."
good,"If you are looking for a chill coffee shop to learn how to make latte art. Starbucks is not the place to work, but if you want a great fast paced job that has AMAZING benefits then work at Starbucks."
good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo. Facilidad de horarios. Buen salario.
good,Just be ready for a lot if you work here. The pay and hour received do not match up to the amount of work one does there. The customer are usually really cool and understanding.
good,Its a great company to work for. my manager is the worst though. They have good benefits and the people are generally nice. They're very open to everythingggggg. so its easy to just be yourself
good,The work place culture is amazing and I really enjoyed being a barista at Starbucks. The hardest part of the job was how many customers come into the store everyday but it was also the best part of the job.
good,Working here is pretty good. Very fast-paced but really helpful coworkers who want to work as a team. I would recommend this job to anyone with a good work ethic
good,"I learned a lot from Starbucks, especially how to best work on a team and how important it is to take pride in your work. I really enjoyed my time at Starbucks because our store was a family, and we all wanted each other to succeed."
good,"Working as a barista at Starbucks was a great experience. I would recommended to any young person looking for their first job. There are so many wonderful benefits to take advantage of, especially the ASU college program. "
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place to work. However, I’ve noticed that it can be political when you try to move up into an assistant manager or store manager. "
good,"Showed initiative and was promoted internally.  Gained supervisory experience and managerial skills. Able to identify opportunities and create solutions, leading to independent management style."
good,Starbucks has a very fast paced enviroment but gets easier over time. I made many new friends with customers as well as coworkers. My time working at starbucks was very enjoyable and an overall great experience.
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for, but there's always a downside. The pay is not enough to support yourself (depending on where you live) and the salary doesn't reflect the hard work you complete everyday. The benefits are SOO wonderful but if you don't need the benefits, it's kind of useless. College kids need more money to support themselves and pay for the amassing debt, not insurance (because most college kids are still under their parent's insurance plan until age 26). The management is usually a hit or miss, but every manager I have worked for has been nothing but supportive. You will learn how to deal with snotty customers who take their anger out on baristas. But learning to handle conflict is a great life skill. On the bright side, I have made many connections and friendships through working at Starbucks. The bonds I've make with customers is so pure and is something I'll carry with me forever."
good,Enjoyed the people who love to drink and enjoy Starbucks as much as I do. I love recommending products and having them try new flavors. I will still buy coffee here :)
good,"A good company, with some good and bad executives.  We have had some real screwball VPs in IT.  And the CTO position is always iffy.  Middle management tends to be more effective/competent"
good,"Fast pace and you do make friends. The pay is good. The best part is you do get paid every week, so if you're running low on cash, there goes another pay check in your account."
good,could be annoying on a busy day cause of they crazy rushes but when things are calm its an amazing place to work at. helped me become more patient with others
good,Great company to work for with half decent pay but some stores are much busier than others and I feel deserve more compensation for the stress. The company is also a bit fiscally cut throat.
good,There is always something to do so the time goes by quickly. Also a lot of fun to be on bar. Management and coworkers are pretty fun. Breaks aren't very long though.
good,"Theres serval things that needed to change at Starbucks, but for a job starting out for experience is a pretty good job, of course if I had no choice i would choose Starbucks again."
good,"My time at Starbucks was enjoyable while at the same time being quite difficult due to the fact I was married and attempting to cover expenses in the greater Vancouver area. "
good,"Great job if youre cool with part time only. College, stock and health benefits. Fast paced and generally friendly work environment.  Would definitely recommend to a college student"
good,Conservan gran apego a los valores de la marca y los representan en sus acciones. Transmiten pasión por lo que hacen y se ve reflejado en el día a día.
good,"My experience at Starbucks was very enjoyable. I learned a lot of things and dealt with different kinds of customer. It was one of my dream to work at Starbucks. But the culture and I didn't jive well so I did not renew my contract. But overall, it was indeed a memorable experience working there."
good,"It is such a great place to work, management does a good job at working with your schedule. Upper management is easy to communicate to if you need assistance from them."
good,Working here was fun.Because I get to meet new people every day and my regular customers as well. And being a barista is all about making coffees and learn new things about coffees and the process. On of the hardest part of the job to is serving customers when the busy time. I've learn a lot from this job like serving customers and handling cash and etc.
good,"-Face paced work environment"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. I had wonderful hours and my co-workers were stellar. I learned a lot about multi tasking and delegating jobs. I left because so many people got hired I could no longer afford my rent. I loved my managers and the culture of the company. Their core values were amazing and made me feel inspired. The hardest part of the job was during rush hours. We worked right under and Amazon building and they love their coffee. Bottom line, I loved working at Starbucks"
good,Typically you jump into your shift feet first going 100 mph. Its difficult at first but its all about rhythm. It is extremely rewarding to be serving law enforcement and first responders as well.
good,"I've always enjoyed serving people and getting to know people. The workload is fair and there are always able chance to get to know customers and coworkers. One of the hardest things about the job is dealing with difficult customers, but I would like to think of those experiences as opportunities to learn how to more properly defuse the situation and have a customer leave with a more positive mood."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. With great benefits and a decent salary, it can be an excellent job for students or even those who'd like to make a career of it by moving up. The only negative is if you really want a decent living salary as a full-time employee the only way to make it is to become a shift supervisor and with that most of your free time will be gone."
good,"Day to day at Starbucks was constantly changing with the amount of customers and attitudes of your fellow baristas. You have to keep that positive attitude in such a fast paced work environment but at the end of the day you felt accomplished and productive with your day. There was never a lack of work whether it was cleaning, stocking or customer service opportunities. The hardest part of the job was the disrespect you received from customers but I try to have empathy in the fact that that may just be having a bad day and need that exceptional customer service and kindness from me."
good,I really have enjoyed my time with Starbucks and always attribute that to the people. I've grown to have such close relationships with those that I work with and call them my friends more than coworkers. Although the job can sometimes be stressful and fast-paced when we work together and tackle it strategically things run smoothly. I've also enjoyed developing personal relationships with our regular customers and talking to them about their day is often the highlight of mine.
good,Mucha oportunidad de aprender acerca del café como desarrollo lateral.
good,"Starbucks is a lovely company to work for. The hours are flexible, the pay is decent, and the overall environment is absolutely wonderful. The company holds itself and its employees to a high standard, with universal rules for how the store is run and how systems should be run, allowing you to perform adequately at any Starbucks store."
good,"Varies with location. Enjoyable at most times, but really stressful when workload becomes overwhelming since you're always understaffed. There is also a lot of night team, morning team arguments debating who does a better job and little to no communication from managers with night team since they only work mornings. Very flexible schedules and hours, decent pay, good benefits, and tips. It's a good job if you're doing other jobs on the side or studying."
good,"It was nice while it lasted. It really helped me develop my skills to advance in my career. I Learned how to work under pressure, but also learned to have fun in the work environment."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks during my early 20s. You meet great people and build real connections with your coworkers. "
good,I enjoy this company and the benefits are amazing but they expect A LOT! It's been worth it to work there but both of the store managers I experienced couldn't help me reach my full potential
good,Very much enjoyed my work experience here. It was a welcoming and positive environment that allowed me to advance within the company should I have desired to do so.
good,They have great benefit and it is fun working with different kind of people.  Not enough pay. Sometimes stressful working with unmotivated people and difficult customers
good,Starbucks is a great place to work retail. The company is great about offering employees a great work life balance on the barista/shift supervisor level.
good,"good benefits, great culture, management was awesome, flexible hours, fast paced but high standards, team work was important and always emphasized, free coffee"
good,"Very flexible, great benefits, pay is decent. One free pound of coffee each week, stocks, affordable health insurance, 30% off discount, great environment. Fast paced. Always busy."
good,"I loved making coffee, I won't lie. I thought the challenge was fun, and kept me from watching the clock at work. The atmosphere was super relaxed and all my co-workers got along great. Most of the customers were nice, but the place became a nightmare during tourist season. "
good,"Loved working here for years... "
good,"Work was high paced, but you learn about efficiency, customer relations and teamwork. The staff were accepting of me as a veteran and older than them but respected my life experience."
good,"While you won't be able to make more than $400 a week with this job, Starbucks has great benefits for even part-time employees. The job can be extremely stressful with the the fast pace and high volume of orders during rush time, so it's not a great choice for those who don't do well under pressure. Otherwise, I highly recommend taking a look at job opportunities at your local store."
good,"It was a great place to work at, the co workers were fantastic and the shift were really fun. I enjoyed getting to know people and to help their day a good with a good cup of coffee."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. It is a fun fast passed environment and with great customer clientele. I enjoyed my time there and would recommend working there. Benefits and management are excellent but scheduling and time management are lacking.
good,Best and worst part of the job were the customers. Management did not always communicate policy consistently between stores. Great people to work with
good,I love the company.  They made a lot of promises as far as advancement but I got strung along a lot.  If you are looking to advance expect to be waiting quite a long time.
good,"I enjoyed my experience with Starbucks. Very fast paced, collaborative, and family oriented work place. Management was very great, workplace culture was great. Overall great experience."
good,"Working at starbucks helped me to become more outgoing, less shy and develop a very good sense of efficiency and also to understand the importance of producing good quality, properly made food and drinks."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Starbucks. I was a shift supervisor while I worked there. My staff and customers were amazing and very kind. My only downfall was the lack of responsibility from my manager. Other shift supervisors including me were working 10+ days in a row due to deciding not to hire another supervisor. But besides that, I love Starbucks and would totally work there again, probably as a barista though!"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks, the people and benefits are above standard and the training process was through. "
good,"Worked at 2 separate locations both in different states and I'd say the best part of working at Starbucks is the fellow coworkers. Starbucks hires friendly, hardworking, passionate, awesome people who end up becoming more like family and good friends."
good,"I would highly recommend Starbucks as an employer.  They truly seek to partner with all employees, they create a safe, vibrant and collaborative environment with focus on team and partner growth."
good,typical day is busy non stop action. Learned great customer service skills. Management just depends on who youre stuck with could be good or bad. work culture is chill depending on business
good,"Everyone there is friendly. I love that it is fast-paced and I love the environment. Considering this is my first job, I have never thought it would be such a rush. I am a fast learner, so I was able to get things down in the span of two months."
good,"My typical work day at Starbucks would be awesome. I   worked closing shifts. I   loved it. The store manager at the time of my employment was absolutely terrible though. He made everyone feel low. But with great co-workers, it was worth every minute. The benefits are amazing if you take advantage. And they really work with school schedules for the most part as well."
good,It's a fun and unique job for people with a specific schedule. The training is tough but it's excellent experience. I would recommend this job to someone who is looking for a part-time job with full benefits.
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks, is busy. When you work in one of their higher-volume store, it is non-stop. Drive-thru is almost always steady, and most of the time, Cafe is as well. The environment is amazing though. Everyone I've work with has turned into my second family. I would give it 3/5 stars for working at Starbucks."
good,"Starbucks was fun cause, there was always a long line and there was always something to do. The team was always incredibly supportive, and the manager was always on top of it."
good,working with starbucks berjaya at genting highlands was my first job experience . which i learn how to face customer/foreigner and we have to communicate in full english .. also improved my confidence . there is no target to achieve but hardwork is important
good,"I love working at Starbucks, but as I've worked there for over a year I have began to notice problems with upper management.  Starbucks claims to care about partners, but in my experience that hasn't been true."
good,"I was an opener for most of the time, It gets tiring and stressful during peak. But free drinks are nice and (Most) customers are polite. You tell the company cares about its employees."
good,"This job is very fast-paced unless you happen to work at a slow cafe. You have to be willing to work hard and quickly and for extended periods of time. That being said, there are usually awesome coworkers and even customers to bond with. Great benefits even for part time workers, but it is very hard to support yourself if this is your only job. Especially if you live in an area with high cost of living."
good,"It was a blast to work for this company. I was honored to work there daily and represent the company, bettering myself along with doing whatever I could to make sure the company was successful."
good,"I've found most baristas or shift supervisors are incredibly friendly and fun to work with, with managers typically having a more hands off approach, giving their staff the flexibility to best serve the customers. For a work environment, I would say it is a great atmosphere. Customers can be difficult at times, but I've found most are kind and patient people who respond to the attitude you bring with you. Be kind and patient, and most customers will respond in kind."
good,"Nice work place when team was good. We manage to build relationships that still last. "
good,At Starbucks you have the unique opportunity to effect someone’s day from start to finish. A smile and good cup of coffee can lead to something much bigger.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. The work is not challenging but does teach you to multi task and prioritize tasks efficiently. Customers vary per location but are generally good mannered.
good,Good company to work for and great benefits.  They are willing to accommodate your schedule and there is a career path available. I would recommend this company to others.
good,"The Store Manager role is demanding and can be stressful, however if you follow the program, and use the tools that are provided, ask questions and take charge of the store and employees  you will succeed.   As a manager you cannot do everything, so delegation and building an awesome team is key.    You don't have to be the best manager you just have to be good, care about your  customers, look after your employees, provide thoughtful feedback to them, and support them by providing positive alternatives for dealing with stressful customers and situations."
good,"For those who desire a fast paced job that allowed time to fly bye, this is it. The customers are usually extremely demanding and seems to strain the store usually."
good,"Most coworkers have a tendency to be reasonable and assist others to grow others want you to learn by what seems like a miracle, if you are an independent person who is okay with a fast pace work place... this will do. Although, i wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who is looking for something permanent. It's great for college students."
good,Starbucks had daily ups and downs with high turn over and constant training. I learned to communicate clearly with my eyes and ears open constantly making sure my team is all on the same step. With the high turn over the potential for bad management exists in regions with little oversight. I always interviewed my managers and chose carefully. Workplace culture was the hardest part of the job for me. I am a focused worker who doesn't small talk. I enjoyed the relationships I made with my local customers and the speed of production during rush
good,"Starbucks is a great entry-level job. You get 30% off as a customer, free at-home coffee mark-outs every week, and free drinks when you're working. You can also become eligible for a 401k, healthcare benefits, and tuition reimbursement for ASU. At my store, there was a great workplace culture, and my co-workers were like my family. Unfortunately, it is a very stressful, fast-paced job. Sometimes management only cared about how fast our drive-thru times were or how many transactions we completed in an hour. As a shift supervisor, you are responsible with how well business is during your shift, and feel a lot of pressure from management."
good,"I had a great time working at Starbucks, especially as a student. It was a relaxed in environment but during rush periods I was kept on my toes. Personally, I liked the mix because I can get bored with things fast. At Starbucks there is always things to do."
good,If you work at a high volume store it is crucial that you have a manager who is actively leading the store. The manager should know  the strengths of each partner and where to place them during peak hours.
good,"Working for Starbucks is honestly great, but as a Shift Supervisor, I felt like I was severely underpaid for how hard I work. I got along with everyone and management was great."
good,"A typical day at work included being friendly, cleaning, serving customers, making drinks, getting food, making ingredients to use, sending people on their breaks and ensuring the food cabinet was full. as a shift supervisor i dealt with money, inventory count, ordering and resolving disputes. the workplace was often positive, fun, high paced and welcoming. I learnt how to resolve issues with angry or upset customers and how to train new team members. The hardest part of my job was making sure the shift ran smoothly when it was exceptionally busy. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my team members and establishing relationships with customers."
good,"Awesome people both customers and co-workers. Fast- paced work enviorment, yet not stressful and rewarding.  I enjoyed always socializing with good people."
good,It was a great experience and privilege working with such great company. I have learned so much that helped me also to improve my skills and other personal aspects.
good,"At Starbucks I found my best friends! They are a good group of people and we became a ""family"". I never dreamed of making coffee for people but I can say that it was a pleasure to work at Starbucks. There were days I wanted to yell at every customer and the job can be very stressful but overall I would give my experience at Starbucks an A-."
good,"Nice people, benefits and good atmosphere to work in...had a great experience. The company made you feel a part of something which was good. Over the years the company has changed but they used to do really fun things"
good,"Working at Starbucks has a steep learning curve regarding drinking making, however once you've gotten past the three month learning period working three is a routine procedure.  During the three month period all my co-workers and managers were encouraging working on the job and made working there a positive experience overall."
good,Starbucks is a great opportunity to get apart of. The hardest part of the job would be busy peak hours and times where there are short staff times. They are always flexible with your schedule.
good,"Pros, many. Free drinks on the clock, 30 percent discount. Benefits are okay. Coworkers are almost always awesome. Cons to few hours. customers can e a royal pain in the neck. Some times poor promo training."
good,"JOURNEE: ouverture salon réception marchandise passation commande"
good,"This job was great, but not a forever job. I enjoyed the management, the co-workers and even the duties. However, I did not enjoy the pay. It was not enough pay to live on."
good,"The Starbucks Culture is a great! The normal work day in Wooster is always pretty busy, but there still fun in each shift. The team I had to chance to work with is very kind and very helpful when it comes to making things go smoothly in the store. The things I learned from working there is being fast is great but connecting with customers is also very important when it comes to sells. There are some days when it can be stressful especially during the summer or the holidays. "
good,Starbucks is a great company overall. I love that it is diverse and that   the customers that have there usual Starbucks location feels very comfortable. It allows the customers and the worker to build a great bond. It's a place to relax other than home.
good,C'est un bon environment les employés sont bien accueillant le service est très actifs les patrons sont à l'écoute
good,"A day at starbucks is like working at home its like a community a nice slice of culture. The best way I can describe starbucks like it like working at a barbershop customers are like family and they bring us gift cards, food and sometime presents if you have manners. I also learn to mult-tasking and to delegate certain situations to benefit the company."
good,"You can develop skills and workplace knowledge. I tried my best to stay with this company, but after awhile most people will separate from the company."
good,"The work is straight forward but can be physically demanding depending on the volume of your store/stores. Hours and availability are flexible, especially for students. Benefits are fortune 500 and available to anyone working just 20+ hours a week. Advancement opportunities are possible but the hierarchy limits the availability. Starting as a baristas might only be worth it if youre looking to become a store/district manager in the future, otherwise, the position might be considered temporary."
good,"Starbucks was my primary job through college. They offer flexible hours and a great benefits package for part-time employees. I met some of my best, life-long friends while working at Starbucks."
good,"I enjoyed my store, crew, and customers at my store. ive learned alot and made life-long friends there. I would probably always feel comfortable going back to work there. Good food, coffee, benefits, and usually a fine place to go even on a day off."
good,"The work varies on the time of day, the mornings are usually busier than the afternoons (unless theres a promotion going on in the afternoon). The work requires patience, multi-tasking, tolerance, hard work, and communication. When there is great communication, we can get through a ""rush"" pretty fairly easily. Working with a good team/shift, is key to getting through a busy day."
good,I absolutely love working for Starbucks but I don’t get the amount of hours that I need. Everyone there is so friendly and eager to help you learn what it is you need to do.
good,Fast-paced environment with fun people to work with.  Store managers are each different. The company has great benefits with a below average pay system
good,It is a good place to work with flexible scheduling and great benefits for part-time employees. Just very stressful and hard to advance in the company.
good,Starbucks values their employees and treats them well. They have flexible scheduling which is great for students. Benefits are also great and they offer opportunities to advance within the company. Could be fast-paced but a fun and enjoyable job overall.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. They offer great benefits, provide partners with career development, and overall inspire a culture that is unified and progressive. The hardest part of the job would have to be the cleaning tasks we are given, sometimes they seem out of reach from what one would expect of such a company. Also, in my experience there has been a depreciation in good management throughout stores. The most enjoyable part of the job is being recognized as being apart of global brand that prides itself in community and creating connections."
good,Training is effective. I love learning getting to learn the neighborhood. Customers are fun! Teamwork is key. Stressful work loads. Way too competitive. Advancement gets overlooked.
good,"I love this company, but there needs to be a complete review of how baristas are treated by higher ups. Ive had great managers and terrible ones. I feel as if a requirement to analyz managers behavior and skills are needed nation wide"
good,"my typical day at work is very busy, i sometimes don't have time to take my lunches or brakes. i have learned to make so many drinks. the hardest thing about my job i would have to say costumer complains. and i enjoying seeing a smile on peoples faces when i make their drinks."
good,"I liked working for Starbucks, its a great job with great benefits and working at Starbucks will allow you to grow leadership and communication skills"
good,Other employees and management were nice people. It was easy to be myself around the other employees. Very relaxed environment. Most enjoyable part is talking with coworkers.
good,Working at Starbucks is great. Although peck hours can make or break you. The over all environment is fast pace and detail oriented. You also need to develop great listening skills.
good,"I was with the company a long time. Underpaid and overworked, especially the past three years since the company has changed so much. Baristas and Shifts should make more then they get paid, also Starbucks should consider hiring more employees so there is enough coverage on the floor. The people that work there are pretty cool though, atleast the locations I worked at."
good,Starbucks is a one of the most popilar coffee seller all of their product was so amazingly prepared in a way proper handling and service it was a blast to work with the starbucks partner
good,"A typical day at work for me would be arriving just before the morning rush, preparing the bar and store for fast and efficient service. I was usually on bar for the morning rush, cleaned in between all customer interactions and restocked the bar constantly. "
good,"This is a fantastic place to work for college students or someone looking for a side gig. They offer you full benefits, plus a whole slew of random perks for working there. I will say if you are looking to make it into a career you should feel passionate about coffee, don't go into for the money."
good,"An excellent entry-level job with lots of opportunity for growth. Perfect for students, parents, part-time and full-time employment. Very flexible hours which allowed me to pursue my goals throughout the years such as going to school, travelling, and working a separate part-time job. Guidance and encouragement from coworkers and managers helped me grow as a person and strengthen many practical and interpersonal skills such as leadership and customer service. "
good,"Work here is fast, but fun, and the people in your store are what really make it great. The hours are flexible, and covering shifts can be much easier than other jobs, because any barista at any store can work at any starbucks, so it helps to make friends with the baristas at other starbucks stores near you. The structure is in place for advancement opportunities if you plan on staying with starbucks for a long time, and the benefits increase the longer you stay with the company. If you aren't planning on staying long, this is still a great job, you can qualify for benefits even as a part-time employee, and as a barista your hours can be very flexible."
good,"There's a lot of perks... encouraged coffee breaks, surface level positivity, open air and bright offices, close to bus lines, progressive benefits package and CEO practices."
good,"Working for Starbucks had it's up and downs.  I would recommend working for Starbucks, as I do believe it is a good company with great benefits.  It does depend on which store you work at however, s my experience, personally, was not as beneficial as it has been for others.  Advancement into new roles can be difficult as well as competitive.  You do have the opportunity to meet many other people, which was the most rewarding out of the experience."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for all the way around. The Barista and Shift Supervisor levels are the most fairly treated and well compensated. As for my experience with the Store Management level--the compensation was very good, but the work/life balance was extremely inconsistent. A great job for a single, working person--but not so good for a family body looking for equivalent time and money balance."
good,"Its a rather busy environment and stressful during peak hours, management can be a little rough around the edges during peaks, and can be a bit short with new members. But other than that every one is very amicable and have made working here very nice and enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at work would be ringing customers, making drinks, and making sure everything is restocked. The pace is very fast so everyone has to make sure they are on top of their own given task or else it will be stressful on everyone else."
good,I worked for starbucks for over 10 years the best company I have ever worked for! They offer great work life balance and if you love coffee and just enjoy working with people this is a perfect fit! I enjoyed the flexibility it gave me while I was going to college and moving around so much allowed me to have a lot of adventures while still having job security!
good,Very very fast paced and demanding of memorization. Can be hectic and you are exposed to a wide variety of individuals to work with. Starbucks is an excellent place for young people to gain experience and make mistakes.
good,"Its really fun you get to meet new people everyday, there is not one day that you can say it was boring. The best part in when you are making drinks during the rush hour since I keeps your mind always preoccupied and time flies by. The only down side is that if you are super slow at something they are going to move you to another position better suited for you pace if you are working during the rush hour."
good,"As a new employee, Starbucks is overwhelming, but becomes a fun place to work once you get the hang of the job. Good benefits and perks (free coffee each week) are offered, but wages are very low. I felt extremely underpaid for the work and stresses involved with the job. The employee turnover rate is ridiculously high due to low pay."
good,"Starbuck has a lot of perks. They are the only company that I know that is super flexible. Im a college student so flexibility is big for me. I can honestly see myself working here again in the future. The job can be stressful not because of the job but the customers. People are very serious about there coffee. The good out-weighs the bad, because the job is also fun."
good,"Open the store by counting the safe and tills. Set up pastries, brew coffee and tea. Even though I had to be there at 4 am I didn't mind because my partners and customers made it worth it."
good,"Starbucks is great that has flexible hours. It fun environment which helps peopme feel like they are at home. The great part is that you can make friends easily. However the hardest part is being short staffed when there is a rush or trying to get more hours. Yes you can pick up hours at different stores but the pay isn't enough for someone who's going to school and living on their own. Working so many hours and getting nowhere is the hardest part. Or trying to move up in the company isn't easy either, not in the store that I work in."
good,"Making people's day, one drink at a time, was simple and fantastic.  I loved the fast paced yet simple environment of Starbucks.  I loved learning the names and orders of the regular customers and having them ready before they came up to the register, if the pace allowed."
good,"You have your everyday house cleaning chores. And making coffee, lattes, and iced blended beverages. A lot of stores have a drive-thru but there are some that do not. Drive thru stores are typically faster paced."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks.  I built good relationships with our community.  I enjoyed the change of menu during the holidays .  Learning about coffee and the regions they are from was interesting.
good,A fun job where you make connections with customers and coworkers alike. Management is great. Excellent benefits. Cleaning and communication very important.
good,"Shifting schedule."
good,"Very fast paced and takes a lot of energy."
good,Very fast paced with making drinks and caring for the customers. It is also about caring for the team. Many of my co-workers love Starbucks. It was a great first job for me. My manager was really understanding with my college schedule.
good,The hardest part on the job is learning how to bar but it will come in time. The most enjoyable thing about working at Starbucks is making a customers or a partners day.
good,Starbucks is a 10 years + client to Infosys and they are venturing into multiple areas to improve Supply Chain operations and make sure they stay leaders in coffee industry.
good,Working at starbucks was definitely a great experience. There a lot of different cultures you get to endure and learn all while learning the millions of new things you did not know about coffee. There is a fair amount of cleaning at starbucks which is clearly necessary when dealing with food but all in all Starbucks is a great experience.
good,"Harris teeter overall is a very good place to work, so long as you can handle the fact that customers are always right and your managers WILL "
good,"You definitely learn a lot working for this company. By no means is everything perfect, but you are treated right, given amazing benefits, and recognition."
good,"I had a lot of fun working at Starbucks during my year and a few months. Great people, both customers and coworkers, albeit a bit stressful at times. They were very understanding about life things going on outside of work and the managers are always approachable and want to do their best to help you succeed, even if that means using Starbucks as a stepping stone to move forward in life. "
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work. However, like with most jobs, it depend on co workers and customers. while stressful at times, it's a good place to work, with nice people and a relaxed atmosphere."
good,"Love working for the company which cares for its employees, love the creative aspect of making coffee and learning customers tastes. Meeting new people from around the word with different tastes as well."
good,Very fast pace and will most likely take awhile to get used to how things work around the cafe but you will be surprised on how fast you will catch on even though it may seem like a lot at first
good,I didn't expect to work here for so long. It was meant to be a temporary job but I grew to love it and they saw my potential and moved me up in the company. Benefits were definitely a plus. It just wasn't the field I wanted to be in otherwise I could have seen this being a great career.
good,"Posibilidad de ascenso y buen ambiente de trabajo, empresa multinacional"
good,"The most enjoyable part of working for Starbucks is the human connection, both with your fellow partners and with the customers. Truly, the quality of the job is determined by the atmosphere created by your partners, which means that your specific location greatly determines your job satisfaction. I have worked at both types of locations, but in general I love working for the company."
good,The management was approachable as a real team. I've learned to socialize to and how to communicate with others and to deal with other people and how to became a flexible type of worker
good,My typical day starts off with me taking over a shift as the shift manager. I will typically place my staff where I need them to be able to cover all the positions needed throughout the shift. Possibly doing inventory and an order. After I start giving breaks and lunches. The best part of the job is having a great atmosphere and regular customers that we get a chance to get to know. There hardest part of the job was that there was a high turn over rate with managers and each one had poor management styles.
good,Starbucks really cares for their employees.I had such a caring boss. I learned quickly how to balance many tasks at once there. I loved to meet new faces and see old ones as well. The staff is so friendly and fun. I still have a good friend who is employed at Starbucks. They are growing so rapidly.
good,"Fue una experiencia que me enseñó mucho sobre el valor del trabajo bien realizado, de manera eficiente y eficaz. Fue mi primer trabajo y me mantuve en el muchos años."
good,"All was good, save difficulties with certain managers who have a ""do what i say, not what i do attitude"", which is very discouraging. They do offer some great benefits, it's more of personal differences."
good,Working for Starbucks is a pleasant experience when you have other commitments such as university degree. It really helps me with my living costs and i can fit my work around my studies. The main priority that working for Starbucks wouldn't affect my main priority - focusing on my degree.
good,"Loved working here. Great place to meet new people and get experience. My personal experience was stained by subpar management. If all cogs are functioning, it is a very fun environment, but it all depends on the management."
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for, but the lack of scheduling/hours made the job harder. They wanted you to focus on customers but do the job of 3 people. Not worth the pay in the end."
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks because it is fast paced, big on customer service, and because you get to interact with tons of people. Ive learned lots about working with different personalities, cash management, time management, and how to work efficiently under pressure. The hardest part of the job is upping cleanliness in the store when not given enough partners on the floor."
good,"Fun place to work whether part time, or to build a career. Flexible hours. Fun co workers. Clean environment, great products, and fast and slow paced (depending on the time a day)."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place to work as a college student or young person who gets along well with others and wants to make peoples' days brighter. However, after 5 years of working there and wanting to find a job more on the path to my future career, Starbucks isn't cutting it anymore. I do love the company and the culture, and the people I've met are some of the best."
good,My time at Starbucks has been great! It's very fast paced and fun! The customers are my favorite part of this job. My least favorite would have to be that I'm burnt out on it all.
good,the only thing was management was inconsistent and there was a high turnover. Besides that the regular work day was easy going and not stressful. I enjoyed the benefits and had a good schedule.
good,"The culture and perks of working at Starbucks are, for the level of work for many people within the company, outstanding. Upward mobility, however, is lacking, as is a livable wage for anyone who's a barista or shift supervisor."
good,"Working at Starbucks, allowed me to further grow and develop customer service skills as I was able to have friendly conversations with many different types of customers. "
good,"The job was very easy, some people over complicate it. and the Benefits and pay were definitely worth the work we had to put in to it. My managers were typically very flexible and always prioritize scheduling needs when doing labor forecasting."
good,I work for Starbucks since 2014 coming straight out of high school. At the time I loved coming to work just to be able to have my own money earnings each week an I still do. When It comes down to it I liked what I was doing as a barista to a shift supervisor. I think the hardest thing that I had to achieve was managing my part of the team everyday.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. It can be crazy busy and stressful at times but support from your peers is always there. Its a great job to have but is very difficult to make a career out of it
good,"If you have ever been in a Starbucks, you know it can get busy. Ultimately, that is one of the best parts of the job: there is always something to do."
good,"Starbucks is a great company and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good job with fair pay. It is a great experience and will teach you many things, such as how to allocate jobs to others, work balance, etc."
good,"Starbucks was a very positive place to work. Fast paced and constantly changing, it kept everybody on their toes! The management personally cared for their staff and any issues were dealt with promptly!"
good,"Working with starbucks taught me not only customer service but also life lesson. Even though some days were tiring and stressful, it is fun and entertaining. I enjoy working here, getting to meet and work with a lot of people, and having regulars to have a conversation with."
good,"excellent if you're looking for a job while in school or on the side. You receive amazing benefits and salary. The only downside is some of the management can be disorganized and in experienced. Also, in the end, its still food service and you will always be tired--and not always treated kindly."
good,"Great place to work if wanting a fast paced environment. Can be stressful, but coworkers, managers, and regulars (customers) make it a very enjoyable workplace. Would recommend to anyone wanting experience in retail."
good,Always a happy upbeat energetic atmosphere to work in. Management was easy going and the customers were great. Overall the best place to work if you do not need to make a lot of money.
good,"It's a claustrophobic environment, moving fluidly through the back area of a coffee shop. You need to be able to mesh well with others, the tasks themselves are not that difficult. Brewing coffee is fairly simple, it's the knowing of the store and how to make sure that task does not interfere with other workers. You'll end up working within inches, reaching over others, mixing mocha surrounded on all sides. You'll grow close and make friends as long as the management remains loose and fosters it. It can be like joining a new group of friends, but I can also see how it would be altogether too intimidating for those who are not open to that."
good,"Working at Starbucks has been a great way to make personal connections with both customers and colleagues. It is a fun environment to work in, even when things get hectic (which they often do!).  Multi-tasking is a must at this job.  It taught me how as long as you stay calm and do your part as a team, any goal can be accomplished."
good,My time at the Starbucks Roasting Plant was very productive.  I felt as though I was making a difference each and every day.  The commute was a just too much and I needed a job in the Reno/Sparks area.  I would recommend this as a great place to work.
good,This was one of the best part-time jobs I have had. Excellent for students! The only downfall is that they allow many call-offs so they always call you on your day off to see if you can work.
good,"It's a great place to work, however alot has to with your manager and what environment they create. If you have a carless manager or a manager who only cares about making profit your environment will show and your partners won't be too happy."
good,Starbucks is a very fun atmosphere but it is very fast pasted. You are expected to be very diligent with your time. Benefits you can't beat with any place.
good,"Great place to work, i just wish that starbucks would align with wholefoods progressive views and pay their employees more. Working overtime at starbucks is barely enough to live."
good,"Gute Aufstiegsmöglichkeiten."
good,Great company! They where an amazing  company and I will never forget my 7 years with a great corporation. Starbucks taught me everything when it comes to running a million to two million dollar business.
good,"Feels good to work in here, the environment is very happy and everybody is treated very well. Salary is also good. Health and safety measures are maintained all the time and set to a very high standard."
good,It's a great place to work. It requires someone with ambition and who can multi-task. The management all depends on the store. I've worked with really good managers and I've worked with poor management. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with partners that become your friends and family.
good,"The hardest part of the job is making sure the customers stay happy with all the tasks thrown at you, especially if there are understaffing issues.  But on a typical day, depending on who you are working with, it can be quite productive and fun.  Just make sure you stay in your role and do your best there and eventually you will be rewarded, if only internally."
good,They are continually asking for more and more in New York City Metro. It is truly a high pressure environment working in NYC Metro. The pay is excellent in NYC though.
good,"Great place to work if you want to go to school. Come in with a passion to be the best and an attitude of humbleness.  Be careful with the people though, very sensitive."
good,"Starbucks is a fun, fast paced work place. A great job for first time workers to learn the ethics of working hard and instilling values for future employers."
good,The benefits are GREAT and the management was extremely fair and honest. The work environment was fast paced and really fun. They were also very flexible with scheduling.
good,"One of my favorite jobs thus far. We rotated positions throughout the day, so at some points I would be on register, at other points I would be restocking and cleaning the store, otherwise I was actually crafting beverages! Always on my feet and trying my best to make the customer happy."
good,"Depenedning on your shift time, the usual day is very fast paced demanding focus. The busiest is morning rush where every position requires honestly engaging with hundreds of customers. I've learned what it means to work as team and helping others and sacrificing selfish needs for your partner and ultimately the customer. Being a part of a team where everyone works well together makes the workplace much more enjoyable.  Al I've taken on the task of training and helping new hires to learn the easiest methods of work and consistency. The hardest would be being understaffed during heavy rush periods. The best part of working with this company has to be learning from your team members and becoming better in daily task and learning qualities to take on further in my career."
good,"The staff is very caring especially toward our customers. It's pretty interesting to actually have a staff that cares about their job, and work hard to make sure the store is in great shape."
good,"Sense I had joined the Starbucks crew after working as a cashier in Ingles, typical day of work for me usually starts with me clocking in to work, putting on my apron, and going straight to the espresso machine; because I am the one that makes the espresso drinks. Sometimes we switch jobs, which means I would be on the cold bar making the frappuccinos. There are usually at least 3-4 people in the kiosk on every shift. Sense Ingles cooperation is over the Starbucks kiosk, there are a lot of people coming to get coffee when ever they shop for their groceries. So at times it can get stressful when people come in all at once to get coffee but that is when I just pace myself and take my time to get everyone what they need. The most enjoyable part about my job is that you get to build relationships with the customers because most of them come in everyday, so you start to remember what they order and the things they like. My manager is very easy going and helps my co workers and I with anything that we need. She is hard working and kind. The one thing that I have learned working there is that, even in tough situations, you will always get through it if you have a great attitude and a smile."
good,"While I've only been working at Starbucks for around a year, I pick things up extremely quick and have managed to find a niche spot in the work environment. It is not a job for people who suffer from extreme anxiety or stress and don't know how to handle that. Day to day work differs and depends on the type of shift you work. Customers vary from pleasant to horrific regardless of being regular customers or brand new. The workplace has it's fair share of drama between employees but turnover rate is high enough that it doesn't bother too much. Best place to work if you are a student with a specific schedule. Benefits are fantastic to take advantage of. "
good,"Starbucks is a great company with amazing benefits. They do a great job of creating a positive team culture and making you feel valued as an individual. However, as a manager you are under a great deal of pressure to meet drive-thru times, stay compliant with company procedures, and also managing your team to be the most effective during peak hours. It's definitely a lot of work and can be intense at times, but if you have a positive attitude and like to keep busy it can be very rewarding."
good,This job is great if you are attending school and need flexible hours. The people there are great and the customers that come in regularly are an added bonus.
good,"It's worth it if you're a student and trying to work something flexible part time. Otherwise, the abuse from customers is a bit overwhelming sometimes."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing place to work at. It is normally is fast place environment and you always have to be attentive and active in order to do your job. It may get challenging at times but once you get through it, it feels rewarding."
good,"I truly enjoyed working here. If you like a fast paced work environment then this is the job for you. I worked at a drive thru so it was more labor intensive experience. Every location is unique and recommend it. They do give benefits for part time workers and if you are direct with your manager, they accommodate schedules for students."
good,"Absolutely my favorite job I have had so far! The environment, employees and the people are just right for me! It can get pretty tiresome to work days in a row, especially for the pay but I do love my job and value the role I play as a barista. I have never learned so much about myself or about my values as an employee before!"
good,"Lots of opportunity for advancemnt and growth. Great medical benefits , free coffee. I never really realized how expensive good coffee was until I left and had to pay full price!"
good,"A typical workday consists of a well organized floor plan where partners are set at specific jobs during peak hours to reach our store goal. Working as a strong team is something I have adopted from this job. Management varies from store to store, one store may have an excellent manager whiles some others do not. The culture of the workplace is motivating and organized. Personally I do not see something being hard; in the food and customer service industry one can not please everyone so consistently having happy customers is a goal but wouldn't say hardest part. Most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with customers and meeting new people everyday."
good,"Starbucks is overall a great company to work for with many benefits and perks for employees. I learned much about time management and cash handling. My fellow partners are generally good people, ranging from high school students to older individuals. Sometimes we are understaffed, which makes the atmosphere a little more stressful, but generally not unbearable. Starbucks is a fast-paced environment, and we never stop moving. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely crafting many different drinks and creating customer connections, providing a warm and welcoming ""third place"" for our customers."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Starbucks, good management and a decent wage with in work benefits. It can be hard work, particularly in the run up to Christmas, but the busy days are enjoyable and make the time fly by."
good,"Super fun place to work. It starts off rocky, because there is alot you will need to remember, but once you get a hold of it, it is amazing! Truly and experience"
good,As mentioned - good to start off for people coming in to London area. Good for learning the basics of customer support. The work environment most of the times is multicultural. Salary is questionable for the amount of work you have to do.
good,It was always a very fast paced establishment. Everyone was super friendly and eager to help out fellow coworkers. Their educational programs were amazing.
good,"Company culture is amazing, this is specific to the Los Angeles area. Incredible leaders and a fantastic CEO that cares about its people. "
good,"I like the company but it's a hard stressful job. I had to constantly tell myself ""its just a coffee shop"". But i don't regret my time with starbucks."
good,"A typical day was meeting new people in diverse communities that make up our stores."
good,Management can be good or bad. My most recent manager is an excellent leader and great at directing his partners to a common goal. I would recommend this as a great first job.
good,A typical day at work is very fast going and fun. I learned a lot about drinks and being nicer to people. The enjoyment of the job is the food and atmosphere.
good,"Ive had my ups and downs with the company; they have great benefits, flexible hours, and also a very positive environment. my only advice is to read up on your training, and also be ready to display assertiveness and integrity, for sometimes management can sometimes but not always tend to overstep boundaries also customers can be very intense. overall, Starbucks is a great company;weather if its a part time job, or a potential career choice!"
good,"the life of a Barista is a challenging and awarding in itself. Not being a coffee drinker myself sipping down an iced caramel machiatto. I learned that there are alot of different types of beans that are very unique to one another. The morning shift was given to me which i highly loved. I worked with a team that, like me, enjoyed starting peoples day with a cup of instant smiles and in style. When it comes to difficulties the only things i can think of is it was too small of a work space for the amount of customer and employees inside.  Starbuck is a great company to work for."
good,"Starbucks is a quick-paced and sometimes stressful job with opportunity for advancement and good benefits. The culture is the best part of the workplace. Work environments differ from store to store and from manager to manager, but the company model and philosophy for customer service is inspiring and, if followed, creates a very good work environment. Scheduling is flexible. It sometimes feel like we don't get paid enough for the work we do, but the benefits make up for it."
good,A typical day at work was quite organized. I learned to be able to interact with customers in a genuine and honest manner. Management was not the greatest but we learned to work together efficiently. I would say the hardest part of the job was communicating with my former manager. The most enjoyable part of the job were my coworkers and employees. I looked forward to going to work each day because of them.
good,"Starbucks purchase quality coffee everyday. A place for conconversation and a sense of community. We also offer a selection of premium tea, pastries and delectable treats."
good,As an early morning opener for nearly all of my experience working with this company I enjoyed the steady flow of regulars that I came to know and connect with. The passion for learning more about coffee and my customer service skills lead me to help open a new store where I was able to grow as a reliable worker.
good,"Lovely customer facing job, but a lot of responsibilities - there is always something that needs done! A strong team makes working there a joy, but poor management can cause tensions"
good,"Als ich neues kamm,haben alle Mitarbeiter mir gut geholfen.Sie sind sehr freundlich und haben gutes Auftreten."
good,Great teamwork/Promotions available for hard working individuals/ Opportunity to meet and greet customers from all walks of society never know who will be coming through the door.
good,"Starbucks is a great first job or part time position. Anyone looking for good health insurance this is your place, but it wont make you much cash after that gets taken out of your paycheck."
good,It's a great place to work. It's a very accepting and tolerant culture that loves it's caffeine... just don't hold your breath on advancement in my district
good,"Starbucks is definitely one of the best jobs I've had, I just wish they enforced their values better across the board. For the most part, partners are supportive and positive, but when a team member isn't quite living up to company standards, management seems to be a bit too lenient. Also, there doesn't seem to be much room for internal advancement, despite the claim that the opposite is true."
good,"Benefits and pay are great! Management is different depending on the store but generally they are great! Workplace culture is great, flexible scheduling, and a great work atmosphere!"
good,"Starbucks is known for having an amazing benefits package for its employees, and I can say with certainty that all the positive claims are true. You get medical, dental, vision, life insurance, 401k, AND stock options. You can't beat that."
good,"I have worked with the company on and off for 4 years. If I didn't think it was great I wouldn't go back. Great scheduling, benifits to all partners, great atmosphere."
good,"Starbucks is always pushing its employees to go above and beyond."
good,making drinks was the funnest part and is something i can take with me at other places of employment. hardest part about this job is the pay and getting a raise and/or advancing within the company.
good,loved it loved it loved it miss it bean stock yay stocks! we're partners! really it was so much fun working the bar cranking out the absolute tastiest premium crafted beverages with a quickness the flash would envy thanks to all the FREE coffee inundating my very core HUZZAH! I made so many friends there... i miss my friends.
good,"Work taught me how to work under pressure and work well as a team. Working and assisting the store manager gave me product knowledge, overall I learned much about myself,"
good,"Starbucks is a company that stands for great values. such as getting to know others, nd assuming the best in others. a typical day at work is helping customers and cleaning and making drinks. the management at this location can be questionable sometimes, because I do not feel valued like we are supposed to. but inspite of that the most enjoyable part of the job is helpng my customers and partners"
good,"adorei trabalhar lá! vale muito apena, exceto a gerente que era péssima."
good,"My coworkers are fantastic and make it a great place to work at, but I know that you can work at a store with bad coworkers. Manager isn't great - lazy, don't help too much, doesn't put as much love into his drinks as us baristas (I've gotten comments from customers), becomes very rude and hard to work with. Starbucks has great benefits, though, including FREE COLLEGE."
good,"Working at Starbuck's you learn organization skills, multi-tasking skills, verbal communication, and team building skills, overall Starbuck's is a faced paced high volume business in which we provided a smile with every cup."
good,Starbucks has one of the coolest work environments that I have experienced. The people that work there are cool and laid back and the majority of customers were the same way.
good,"typical day at work would be high paced with constant flow of people, need use of attentiveness to ensure that customers receive their exact order. I've learned to time manage and it strengthen my ability to handle stress. Workplace culture is built on partnership and working as a team to complete a goal. the hardest part about this job is making sure everyone is on the same page. the most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships that can grow with customers."
good,Starbucks is a widely known coffee place loved by many people. As a barista one is required to work in a fast and loud paced environment serving customers of all types. Because Starbucks offers many customizations each drink is crafted to the customer's individual tastebud. The work environment can get crowded and hectic but the people work as a family to get each drink made to perfection.
good,"It's more challenging than you probably expect, but if you can handle it and you like people you'll do fine.  Expect to have to master a pretty wide range of skills quickly."
good,"-Provide top standards of customer service to all people "
good,"The culture throughout Starbucks is that of inclusion and nurturing. A typical day would include exceptional customer service while preparing high-quality beverages to customers. From my experience management is always willing to listen and wants to help to do what will work well for both the store and partners."
good,"The company overall is great. The pay isn't the best, but they make up for it with the fantastic benefits. Very fast paced, and have to be able to multi task. Very fun environment when the whole team works together, but can go downhill very fast if some people slack."
good,"Pros:"
good,Starbucks is full with perks and great benefits. I mean who doesn't love free coffee. People I work with are great and atmosphere is fun. Sometimes you get those nasty customers but no matter where you go thats going to happen.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with. We try to get as much work done as possible and our heads are all in the right mindset. But we have fun all at the same time. I love to have a job that I enjoy so much. The benefits are amazing. The managers are very understanding and there are a lot of opportunities to get more hours. The hardest part about this job is living with the pay (9.00 an hour). The most enjoyable part of my workday are the people. Whether that be co-workers or the customers, I love going to work."
good,"I havent had a job that made me feel as valued as an employee as much as this one. My manager worked so hard for each employee. He went out of his way to make us feel valued and important. There was no end of helpful training, tips, and information. Everyone who worked here had everything they needed to thrive at their fingertips. This is a job I'll think of fondly for a long long time."
good,"Loved working at Starbucks, my manager was exceptionally on top of everything in the store and was very hands on when it came to how smoothly things ran. We were a VERY busy store, and always had adequate coverage and my coworkers were very encouraging! I worked at the Battlefield BLVD location in Chesapeake, VA and would work there again in a HEART BEAT. I recently transferred to a store in San Diego, and the communication through management here is horrible, and I have heard nothing but complaints from other partners upon my arrival. I am very thankful for the quality of work at my last store, and it made me whole heartedly appreciate Starbucks and the company as a whole. The benefits of the job make it worth it."
good,Learned how to be more outgoing and productive.  Achieved excellent time-management skills. Hardest part of the job would be learning all the drinks/ daily routines. Most enjoyable part of the job is free coffee and conversation with friendly customers.
good,A typical day consisted of creating an enjoyable experience for customers. Which is what I enjoyed doing because I like interacting with people. the only down fall was dealing with angry people.
good,"Fun Environment, taught me about teamwork and working under pressure to attain the same goal. Gave me experience in Customer Service. The hours were well and benefits did the workers justice."
good,"This is a fast-paced job, particularly if you work mornings. You can create a good sense of community and friendship within your store by not only working hard, but having fun while doing it. The benefits are pretty great as well."
good,"It is a great working environment and they provide an exceptional amount of benefits. A great job that is warm and welcoming,, makes you feel welcomed and appreciated."
good,"To manage, control and develop the success of Starbucks. Regularly exercise initiative in managing the store. Managing and coaching employees, making people decisions e.g development and recruitment, ensuring customer satisfaction and product quality. Provide a unique coffee experience to all of our customers by providing a prompt service, quality beverages and products and maintaining a clean and comfortable environment. Manage the financial performance along with health and safety and security issues."
good,"I love coming into work to see my coworkers. They make long, endless shifts worthwhile. Our location is constantly busy, with students, workers, and guests from all over come to visit. Management is excellent, well rounded and very understanding. The hardest part is the traffic and the occasional entitled customer trying to ruin our day but its manageable."
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with the different customer's orders and getting them to be exactly how they wanted it to be. Customer care is the most important thing
good,part time benefits are amazing. very flexible with your schedule. fast paced high capacity at times but also can be very relaxing. perfect for the average college student
good,"I was with the company for over 2 years. Had they paid their shift leaders better, I would most likely still be there. Sometimes the stress of leading a team and making sure every aspect of the shift is running smoothly was overwhelming. It wouldn't have been so bad if new employees would slack or end up quitting 2 weeks into being employed there. Besides that, I do believe Starbucks is a great way to build job performance and work ethic."
good,fortune 500 company has multiple stores all over the world. Canadian East head office is located in toronto while having other one in Vancouver. GTA has a great amount of them.
good,"A day at work for Bon Appetit was always a busy/productive/fun day.  All the workers and management were regular people trying to get their job done.  Working here i learned even more about customer service then I already knew.  Also i learned how to make more beverages than you could ever imagine.  Management always stayed on top of what they needed to do.  Some things went over managements head but they have a lot on their plate and no one is perfect."
good,"Investing in people company where I developed from part time Barista position to Store manager."
good,"This is a great job for college students or someone needing part-time work with benefits. It's company policy to accommodate employee requests for time off or difficult schedules. "
good,"Very fast paced environment, it is important to be able to think on your feet. I have learned how to properly take care of a customer. The customer is always right."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consists of a heavy flow of customers, cleaning, and preparing drinks as fast as possible. I came from another cafe to Starbucks and I really enjoy the company culture. Definitely, one that shows that you're important and cared for. I worked under several managers and it definitely seems to be the luck of the draw. I've had excellent managers and some poor ones but typically they're sensitive to your concerns. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with my fellow employees, it can be a really hard job if you don't get along since it is heavily teamwork based. Though if you communicate, work well with others, and enjoy people you'll love it."
good,I enjoy the fast paced work days and getting know my co workers. Starbucks is a fun place to be if you don't mind working hard. every day when i leave work i feel like i am really working and that to me is rewarding in itself.
good,"I worked as a Barista at Starbucks and all the colleagues we're very helpful and taught me what I know today.  I learnt to make everything on the menu, stock take the food, deal with customers,  clean the cafe from top to bottom,  upsell all sorts of things.  I opened the store and also closed the store making sure it was ready for the next day. I learnt a lot of new skills and would reccomend that job to everyone who can handle very busy situations and who can keep calm and patient with all customers."
good,"Everything was great except my manager. The company itself is amazing. Benefits are great, partner resources are incredible. I probably would never leave if it weren't for an awful manager who didn't follow Starbucks standards for employee treatment and knew how to do her job."
good,"I pursued this position for one reason-money.I infrequently visited Starbucks prior to being brought on the team.However,once I got past my own indifference about where I was,I learned quite a lot.The position of Barista is one that will build character if nothing else.Also,I was given an opportunity to flex my ""social muscles"" every now and then.I had a wonderful manager,worked alongside great colleagues,and worked fairly flexible hours.If one wants to move upwards,the possibility certainly exists.Not a bad gig."
good,great place for college students or  for those looking for great benefits. The company is great but does lack in some areas as far as management consistency.
good,Worked with an amazing staff. Management has very good people skills and are easily able to to associate with each employee to better understand all task at hand
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for if you are a student looking to pick up part time work. schedules are flexible and pay is okay. Management is great depending on who you get but overall would recommend as a good choice for a first job
good,"Great place to work in customer service, occasional staffing and/or management issues but very fun and great for building interpersonal relationships."
good,"This job starts off telling you those who show promise have great chances to progress in the company.  That is a big thing for me, progression I loved the thought that maybe i could move up in the company.  They have tons of positions and very flexible on hours.  They give reviews that will help increase your pay, I loved the job."
good,I enjoyed working here. was pretty easy and time went by fast when busy. Also I had a really cool Manger. pretty cool co-worker too. only thing that i didnt like was rude customer. Thats not the company fault overall really good (teen job)
good,"Environment is pretty relaxed. I like the smell of coffee in the morning and I am one of the first one to experience it. Co-workers are easy to get along with, they make my shifts fun. Seeing regulars everyday and knowing what's going on in their lives is exciting."
good,"-We are one of the busiest Starbucks in the region. So a basic day at Starbucks is just how it sounds busy and very fast paste. I enjoy my job here but it is time for me to find something Ill grow from and learn more valuable things. Management is great, very understanding and super awesome people. My co workers make my job feel like a second home. The hardest part of my job would have to be being on my feet all day, that is something is don't look forward. The most enjoyable part would have to be getting to spend the dray interacting with great people and having great co workers that make the day go fast."
good,"Small, but terrific team. Young, vibrant clientele. Great location. Great rapport between businesses in the area. Brand recognition helped with cross-promotion with other restaurants, bars and theatres."
good,"I worked at Starbucks from 19-29 years old and was able to obtain my master is social work and have three children. Excellent maternity leave & other benefits. matches 401K 100%, good insurance & free stock shares every year. Great friendly environment."
good,"Travail en équipe agréable, bonne ambiance."
good,"Since Starbucks is an international organization, it goes without saying that at times the company's management is sometimes scattered and frantic when the company is booming. However no matter who the management team is comprised of, the baristas are always given an environment to grow and create a culture with each other and the customers that they serve."
good,"Depending on the location the job can have you on your feet for a full six hours of working back and forth on the floor to craft drinks at a busy location, or have you idly cleaning the store at a more quiet one. Either way you tend to get first hand customer experience while also learning the fundamentals of learning how to craft various caffeinated and non-caffeinated drinks. The position will shift and change as Starbucks makes changes to the store every season. They also allow opportunity for growth if you actively seek it out. Their scheduling is very broad and open to suit the barista's needs as well. As a result though, paid vacation is difficult to earn and takes about two years before a week's eligibility is earned. Also, for those seeking full-time employment, it can be difficult trying to work over 30+ hours a week as management prefers to even out the hours among all the baristas. Starbucks is a golden opportunity for those also attending school or looking to get their first job experience. However for those seeking a more stable lifestyle, it becomes difficult to make ends meet even with promotions."
good,"Starbucks has given me so much. A passion for coffee (which as a cardiac patient, I never imagined I would have), the ability to see value in starting the day early and truly great benefits."
good,Customer service and cleaning. Those are the essentials when working for Starbucks. This job has taught me to multitask more efficiently. An enjoyable company to work for with proper management and a well coached team.
good,"L'ambiance était magnifique à l'époque ou je travaillais là-bas, c'est le paradis du temps partiel."
good,great place to meet people learn a little bit of everything from the business management are nice & fair people but some more then others the workplace culture is great different people and styles of people makes you feel very comfortable the hardest part of the job i would say is management keeping you waiting the most enjoyable part of the job was the fast pace environment but great meeting new people everyday.
good,For anyone looking for a fast paced environment that will always keep you on your toes this is the right place. There is always something to do even when there's is not and everyday is defferent.
good,"Minhas experiencias dentro do Starbucks de inicio foi como Barista, depois treinadora de futuros Baristas e Coordenação. Baristas preparam as bebidas dos clientes e faziam a limpeza da loja o tempo todo. Treinadores de Baristas ficavam focados em treinar os novos funcionários e em aprender sobre os cafés e chás sua grande história. Coordenação, comandavam o dia dos baristas e treinadores, sempre ditando a todos as funções do dia e de como deveriam ser feitas, no final do turno fazia uma contagem de tudo dentro da loja e contagem do cofre, que seria o lucro do dia."
good,"Starbucks benefits is probably the main reason to apply here, other than that you will learn a lot about handling customers that don't have coffee at 4 a.m haha. But really why wouldnt you apply somewhere offering free college? cmon now"
good,I love Starbucks Coffee Company. I have nothing but good things to say about them. Great Company to work for. They have great Health benefits and are amazing at training. Great customers and great team members.
good,"When your core employee base is college students, it can be stressful just because of a high turnover with everyone coming and going.  The regulars are great, but the obnoxious customers do exist.  Honestly if you show up to your shifts and at least try and be productive you'll be just fine.  Days tend to be fast paced and are sometimes understaffed.  Nights or closing are generally slower but you end up cleaning ALL THE THINGS.  I think Starbucks is a great company if you are looking for a first job, they offer great benefits and it is pretty easy to move up to Shift Supervisor."
good,"Great for college students and part time workers. I have a great manager who is very understanding about special work schedules. Wish we can get paid more, but a great company to work for."
good,Starbucks employment provides a great job opportunity for those looking for a job that is willing to be flexible with their schedules; often best choice for college students. Also provides great benefits as well as giving their employees free college rides through ASU.
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic company to work for. Offers great benefits and is always looking for ways to assist those trying to move up within the company. On top of all the other perks, the accepting, caring, personable, and reliable staff make working in this fast paced environment fun."
good,"a typical day is usually busy, always multi tasking in store and drive thru orders, multi tasking is probably the hardest part of the job because of how busy business can be throughout the day, the best part is connecting with the customers and creating new relationships and friendships"
good,"This job was a fun place to work, great environment, loved helping customers. Typical day at work is stocking shelves, prepping food and drinks. Management is fun and very professional, and tries to work with you on scheduling."
good,"Good environment,and fun customers. Lots of manuals to review. Ontime salary and paid overtime. Management acts professional and also the co workers. Minimal time to not be productive. Ensures that everyone has enough time to sleep and good schedule"
good,"Me gusto mucho ese trabajo, el ambiente muy divertido y siempre apoyando con lo que se necesite para la operación."
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic place to work, you must be willing to throw yourself into anything and have a passion for the company and cause. If you are dedicated and enthusiastic then this is the place for you. The hours can be tedious but with the store being busy 80% of the time and there always being something new to learn it would be difficult to get bored. Starbucks is always looking for new ways to improve the company and to support their Partners."
good,great company to work for! The training is excellent and chance for advancement is great. Ability to work selected shifts or fit into your schedule is dependant on the manager of the store.
good,"Good benefits, work/ life balance and culture. Pretty busy at times but all in all it was a good place to work. Would work at a place similar to this again."
good,"Working at Starbucks can get hectic, but its not hard. Opening the store includes preparing teas and coffees, preparing frozen foods and pastry items, preparing espresso machines, and quickly cleaning any dirty areas. During the day its customer after customer, but with a full team, the jobs get done smooth and quick."
good,The best Coffee and consistency within the nation. I can go out of town and find the same taste in my coffee.As a Starbucks fan they earn their strips by pleasing the consumer.
good,"So fun and interestinf, everyone in here is friendly therefore we always have each other. Also it gives such a good experience for all the students that work there."
good,"Though most days were monotonous in nature, the same routine in cleaning, prepping, inventory and the like, the typical work day was saved by the experiences with both co-workers and customers. After time, these people became a family that made going to work worthwhile. These people, with their individuality and life experiences, created what we liked to call ""Starbucks Culture"". It was almost a different world coming into the store. You'd have conversations with complete strangers and your co-worker became your confidant and actual partner. You learned to respect everyone and handle situations you wouldn't normally think you'd find yourself in. The down side, you can't always make everyone happy and you just don't get paid enough for the things you do and deal with. Customer service is an extremely taxing field and we are often times belittled by customers (mostly non-regulars)."
good,"A typical day at work would be high energy as soon as you walk into work, very friendly work environment. I learned to work at a fast pace, to always put the customer first."
good,It is a very fast paced environment and you always have to be on your feet ready for anything. I've learned to always keep a smile on your face when working with not so nice customers.
good,"Typical retail job with plenty of benefits. Flexible hours and great environment. "
good,"•	Provided customers with  information about products, prices and billing;"
good,"Starbucks Coffee is a good company. They build good work culture, they motivate employees to be at their best and their main priority is to give excellent customer service"
good,"Depending on the location management can be terrible all the way from Regional down to the store."
good,"As far as Service industry goes, you couldn't ask for better. "
good,"I love star bucks and working there , i had a great team . the benefit was nice . they had profit sharing . it made me very stable job, and always hours to work and hours to work over time if you liked."
good,Great benefits and opportunities to own stocks and have a 401k. Starbucks takes care of their employees and makes sure that they are able to afford college through their Arizona State Program.
good,"Working at Starbucks was always great, everyone was easy to get along with and the way we made coffee was simple and easy."
good,"Great job to hold part time during my undergraduate studies. The management team was supportive and really cared about your satisfaction as an employee, which in turn, motivated me to work hard."
good,"Starbucks is a company with great workplace culture and I learned a lot of skills working here, specifically with customer service."
good,"Busy days, sometimes difficult costumers but usually great coworkers. Fantastic benefits, however managers can be rather hard to work with. Hardest part being the rushes, most enjoyable being bond formed with fellow co-workers and regular costumers."
good,The company has an unique culture and brings it to employees and customers. Very nice work environment and development opportuinities
good,"Starbucks is the perfect job for someone who works very well in a highly structured team environment, the job is divided up into a series of workshop tasks that are assigned and reassigned to different associates by supervisors throughout the day. The job is very repetitious, but I found my time with my customers made it much more enjoyable. Also crucial to a Starbuck's success is its team, starting with the management; because you're working in such close quarters with each other you all spend a lot of time together, no stalking off like in a department store. So if there is any tension within ranks it is quite evident and makes for an uncomfortable working situation."
good,"Starbucks where i am currently working is not just cafe. Our partners are trying to give customers experience, which is very comfortable place for customers like home or workplace. We can learn not only to make coffee, customer service also starbucks' marketing that we offer loyalty card and new promotion."
good,"a typical work day at starbucks is fast n very upbeat, you have to be on point and make sure you dont make any mistakes on the orders. ohter then that the work place is awesome and you get to listen to cool music"
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks. Its a good place to work, the managers and partners make the job more enjoyable.  There can be difficult customers at times and with the help of training and management its easier to work out the best solution for the customer."
good,"Starbucks offers amazing benefits and opportunities therein.   This company genuinely listens to and cares about their employees and is willing to acclimate, within reason,  to their needs."
good,"Management made sure their employees were informed and cared as much for their customers as their employees."
good,"Come into work, you already know your duties as far as where you will be placed, I.E. on register, bar, or cleaning/stocking duty. Stay on track of your responsibilities and everything will be ok. Don't allow yourself to become over whelmed, take control of the day and keep a positive attitude toward any situation."
good,"The rush hour is sure to get your adrenaline going with 80 customers coming through the door every hour! Management is always positive, striving to boost productivity and encourage advancement within the company. Being part of a fun, energetic team and creating relationships with regular customers makes everyday unique."
good,"The everyday environment of Starbucks is nurturing and educational. It is an atmosphere that one can feel like themselves, and feel free to question, grow, and learn."
good,"Working here, you learn how to: have good customer service, learn cash handling, and how to learn if a fast work paced environment. You also learn to work with many different  personalities."
good,"It was a pretty cool job. So much so, that I want to work there again!"
good,"Starbucks offers many opportunities for their partners, and offers benefits that other companies do not. Stock is given after one year of working with in Starbucks, also they offer various health insurance plans and 401K. Starbucks wants their partners to grow with in their company, they know that dealing with customers who are picky with their drinks is very daunting. I don't know about upper management involvement with Starbucks, but they do listen to their partners and customers, which is rare to see in companies these days!"
good,I still currently work as a barista for Starbucks and its the best job I've had so far. Extremely relaxed and comfortable environment and lovely job! Such friendly costumers and an amazing company to work for.
good,"Daily routine for opening and closing is always the same. I love getting up early for coffee so this job was perfect for me. I learned how to deal with many types of people I work with, from brand new baristas to old baristas. My co-workers always make my day but when there are disagreements on the way operations are done, my job gets harder. Overall, I like the atmosphere and the many nice people I meet everyday as I serve their coffee."
good,"some days are harder than others, but this is a great place to get started in the work force. great benefits for employees make the job worth it, but the customers can be difficult to deal with. a great temp job."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work as far as far as job culture, benefits, security, and compensation were concerned. However, I found it to be very hard to maintain a work-life balance there, considering how rigid the scheduling was. Managers were no help either, at least in my high volume city location. In the suburbs it was a singular experience, and I loved every day - even the hardest days. In a city environment, however, it felt akin to working at McDonald's."
good,"Working at Starbucks may not be the most rewarding jobs out there, it's hard work and extremely fast paced which often leaves you feeling absolutely knackered. But if you're in good company, the job is quite fun and you're well looked after. The benefits are also great for any of you coffee lovers out there."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks, I would walk in see who all I was working with, punch in and either begin cleaning (customer support), at the window, or on bar. It was really fun because the other baristas would always keep the jokes coming and entertaining one another as well as the costomers too. The manangement was ok, but the shift leaders in my opinion kept the store together majority of the time. The hardest part of this job would be when we were short handed because then that required people to stay well past there shift and do triple the amount of work because of the call-offs, or no- shows. The most enjoyable part of work, was working at the bar. I got to make all the different kinds of drinks and even make up some of my own."
good,The company is committed to making the moment right for customers and partners while striving to meet high business goals. The college achievement plan and Starbucks rewards are examples of how as a company they are doing this. The hardest thing about working for this company is because they are looking to improve change happens so quickly and so often it's not always clear what the expectations are from leadership. Training on new systems and procedures are not clear and lead to confusion and high stress for employees trying to execute in a short timeline. The best part of the job is being able to help nurture part-time employees grow and achieve things they didn't know were possible. Making genuine connections with customers that are meaningful and lasting are also a huge part of why this company is so great.
good,"Great forward-oriented company."
good,"Working at Starbucks you get to meet many different customers, who often com back on a daily basis. "
good,Great management structure and wonderful culture to work for. I really enjoyed the environment I worked in and had a great staff to work with.
good,even though i was only there for a short period due to moving to ireland. my time there was exceptional and the staff were always reliable.
good,"Coffee culture has become a big part of every day amercian's lives that they have become dependent on it, with that being said; I am pleased to be able to say I can help in a small part of each customers day. I am the first person they see to get their one of a kind personalized drink just for them."
good,"The atmosphere is always nice, they treat their employees like they matter and the training is exquisite. Working with my co-workers was always a reward, the managers were super nice. It is fast-paced, but very easy work."
good,"It was always busy, coworkers were great. The management didn't know how to take the right precautions so a lot of the great workers decided to leave, which included me."
good,"It was a great place to work because the people i worked with were awesome and management was amazing.The benefits are out of sight. I was offered Starbucks stock after my first year, as well as 401k through Fidelity, and a superb Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurance plan. You can cover your whole family with that plan, and it can include domestic partners. I got a pound of free coffee every week and free coffee all day (although I think that was specific to my store, which bent the rules). There's also an Employee Assistance Hotline which you can call if you're having issues in your personal life. And HR is really responsive--they won't see you as a troublemaker if you're legitimately having an issue. They will handle it."
good,Starbucks has helped me improve my customer service and be able to gain more leadrership experience. it is a great first job.
good,"I enjoy a typical day at work being a supervisor, knowing what needs to be done for the day and communicating with other supervisors/baristas tasks and delegating jobs. I have gained a lot of confident in providing excellent customer service and generally communicating with strangers. I have learned how to deal with difficult customers and their complaints appropriately and effectively. The hardest part of my job is taking on a large responsibility that others should be taking on their selves, sometimes not everybody works well as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a fun, energetic, compatible group of co-workers and conversing with interesting, friendly regular customers."
good,"I love working for Starbucks and it definitely has a lot of pros. The main issue I have run into was management, but it was just the store I was at. Depending on who runs the store, it is such a fun job and great opportunity to make customer connections."
good,"Enjoyed all my years here, you are able to move up in the company pretty fast. The staff will treat you like you should be treated. Loved this job...."
good,Working as a partner with Starbucks Coffee Company was a wonder experience. As a Shift Supervisor I was able to learn effective management methods that allowed for a positive work environment.
good,"A typical day at the Starbucks is moving till you get every customer out as quickly and kindly as possible. My co-workers are great to work with even if we have our ups and downs. The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on your face all the time. Customers notice when you are not happy, its nice that they see that."
good,"Even though it can be tough working there, especially during rush hours, I certainly can't explain the satisfaction of making someone's day by giving them the perfect drink. Also the people I worked with were incredible and diverse, and I learned a lot from and about each one of them."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, most of the time. There were definitely times when I felt overwhelmed by the volume of business but I just kept on smiling & hustling to the finish line! I would continue to work for them if the hourly pay was higher!"
good,Fast pace and great team work is what creates the backbone of the company. Managers will work and coordinate with team to fulfill duties leading by example.
good,"Objective"
good,Was very organized structured and fair on all the deligation of jobs.  Easy job to do in a fast pace environment.  Scheduled breaks. I didn't like being scheduled and then sent home of the store wasn't busy. I felt like some of the corporates guidelines in interacting with customers is a little scripted. I think if would be nice for partners to interacted in a natural way.
good,"It was a really difficult environment to work in. But i really learned a lot in this store."
good,"Making handcrafted espresso beverages, interacting face to face with customers, wonderful benefits that have affordable premiums, 401k plan options. The management at the Starbucks location that I worked at in Carmel, IN was amazing! Super supportive Store Manager, great shift management who are able to line out what cleaning tasks are done and which are still yet to be completed. The hardest part of the job for me personally was getting through the morning rush before I had my own personal cup of coffee. The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks was definitely customer interactions. Fellow baristas made an 8.5 hour shift seem like a 4 hour ""Princess"" shift with jokes, conversation, and new drink combinations."
good,"-Fun and fast-paced workplace with great benefits"
good,Starbuck's hire and advertises for retail management  but it aligns more with restaurant management. The company runs very tight with payroll and manager is often scheduled as coverage as barista or register.
good,"Starbucks is unique in their culture and truly work at creating a welcoming environment for its customers as well as its employees. They are great at teaching sales strategies and thinking outside of the box. They encourage independent thinking and genuinely want to hear their employees own ideas and strategies. Starbucks is great at creating a welcoming team environment and creating those close relationships with other employees, customers, and members of each local community. As a manager one of the most challenging things can be finding a nice balance between work and personal life. The expectation is high for store managers and the schedule that is needed to work in order to be successful can make that balance difficult."
good,"boa direção,otima equipe, gerencia qualificada, dirigentes otimos"
good,"Muy buena experiencia. Uno como colaborador siente que es su segunda casa, el segundo lugar. Eres parte de en todo momento."
good,"-Fast-paced"
good,"While on your shift you are paired with coworker and you two team up and take on the responsibilities for the duties that your shift requires. Everyday is a different kind of day at Sawgrass Marriott, some days you are very busy because of events going on in the resort as well was the guests who are staying there. Other days you could have very slow days, where the occupancy of the resort is low, which provides us with time to go over everything again and double check that things are cleaned and organized. You must work as a team in order to get everything done within your shift, so maintaining a good relationship with everyone is key, and having a positive attitude where ever you may be is also key as well. I enjoy speaking with guests and getting to know what they like. I insure that their stay is going well by always smiling and greeting them positively. I would say the some of the most enjoyable parts of the job is making coffee, and interacting with the guests. You get to know them more, and often hear very wonderful stories from all over the world. You get to meet so many interesting people and help make their stay an enjoyable one. Making people happy is what I enjoy the most about this job."
good,"My beginning months at Starbucks were amazing the store I was at felt like a very close family environment. Almost everyone got along well with everyone else and the store manager gave encouragement to everyone allowing an amazing environment to constantly grow and improve. Once that store manager had to leave and a new one came everything went down hill and around 15 people quit within the month, even highly tenured partners."
good,"Sometimes find that some in management don't take the time to understand your needs"
good,starbucks is a fantastic place to work for all kinds of people. it provides a warm and welcome environment. if only the pay was better.
good,Starbucks constantly allows you to learn and grow within the company. The customers and fellow staff create a positive and dynamic work environment and every partner experience is unique.
good,"A typical day in the life of a Starbucks partner consists of the normal brewing of coffee, steaming milk, making frappuccinos, and working with awesome people. This company has been a key part in my development not only as an employee, but as a member of society. The management ranges from district managers to store managers and shift supervisors. Each of these leaders have one mission and that is the development of the company and its partners. My coworkers are one of the main things that keep the job entertaining. The partners are the backbone of the company and having happy partners ensures a sooth running store. Like every job there are some difficult times. Dealing with guests who feel they are entitled is one of the most difficult things, because they almost always get what they want regardless how ridiculous the request, and almost all the time, they get what they want because corporate follows a ""say yes"" policy and doesn't back the partners. Other than that my overall opinion of the company is positive. They definitely take care of their partners."
good,Great place to work at and always meeting new people. I love the environment especially when you have such great customers. As a supervisor I have learned how to develop shy inexperienced workers into productive approachable employees.
good,"ma empresa que prioriza o cafe como uma vida , tinha historia aonde foi produzido como foi produzido , tipo diferenciados aonde a gerencia se importava em saber pra passar aos clientes equipe era muito boa se doava para melhorar o dia a dia ."
good,"Cada día que tengo turno en tienda es aprender algo mas, entre compañeros de trabajos y/o clientes. Respecto a esto ultimo, me encanta la relación que puedo entablar con un cliente, siempre hay un pretexto que te permite conversar con él e intercambiar ideas, sobre todo compartir la pasión por el café y Starbucks."
good,I enjoyed working there because I was able to see different diverse groups of people and learn how to manage my time well under a certain time. I think it taught me how to interact with customers as well
good,"I really enjoy working at Starbucks. The benefits are incredible and  usually my co-workers are pretty amazing and friendly. Sometimes you have to go in to work at 4 o clock in the morning which can be pretty brutal but the hardest part about working at Starbucks just like any job in the service industry, is dealing with the customers."
good,"Fun to work at if the other partners are fun as well, Can be very repetitive after a while, tolerate a lot of rude people. Benefits are a bonus and tuition reimbursement."
good,insanlarla iç içe sempatik bir şekilde olmayı gösteren en iyi firmalardan biridir. en güzel göstergesi güler yüzdür. misyonu günlük hayat da da kullanıla bilir.  Misyonumuz: ilham veren ve insan ruhunu zenginleştiren bir marka olmak. Her seferinde bizimle ilk tanışmanız ve ilk kahveniz olabileceğini düşünerek servis  yapmayı ve her güne ilk kez başlıyor gibi bakmak insanın içerisindeki o enerjiyi ilk günki gibi tutmasını sağlıyor
good,A typical day at work is busy. You're constantly cleaning or restocking. It's organized as to where everyone is supposed to be and everything is usually pretty smooth. You learn a lot about coffee and where it's from and how it's best brewed. You also learn about customer service. Good opportunity for advancement.
good,"Starbucks can be a fun, energetic, and positive environment but this varies from store to store depending on management and your coworkers. Overall, you learn great customer service skills and how to stay busy and improve the overall function of day to day business. The first couple months are the hardest since you have to learn all of the drink recipes, and making the drinks quickly and correctly takes time as well, but you get faster as time goes on. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to make customers happy and developing relationships with the regular customers that you see everyday. Free coffee and exploring all of the different drink possibilities make the job fun too!"
good,"I learned how to work better with others, how to communicate better. Constant observing of the environment to maintain the store operations and provide the best service for customers."
good,"I loved my coworkers while working here, but at times it was very stressful and busy. Working here taught me a lot about stress management and how to remain calm in difficult situations."
good,"Me ayudo a la insercion al mundo laboral, pero tambien permitiendome seguir mis aspiracion en el ambito de la educacion"
good,Very good work environment with great company culture. Good opportunity to advance and good flexibility. Great place to begin a career.
good,"While oftentimes hectic and stressful, working at Starbucks overrall has been an enjoyable experience. A typical day at work includes taking orders, making drinks, prioritizing tasks, and deep-cleaning- all while establishing ultimate customer satisfaction. Job culture and coworker attitudes vary greatly from store to store. I've worked in extremely unprofessional, inefficient stores, as well as smoothly-running, friendly stores. There seems to be enough upward mobility that management is friendly while still held to a high standard. The hardest part of the job is by and large fulfilling customer needs while under a small time constraint and in a small space. However, it's worthwhile for the multitude of Starbucks benefits, which include anything from free drinks while on the job to free education otherwise."
good,My co-workers are like my best friends now! Starbucks is really flexible and the people there are really understanding! It's actually the first job I have personally really enjoyed and liked. Many of the customers are understanding and really respectful. I love working there to be honest. You also get to try all the new beverages before it even comes out! That's a total bonus!
good,"Great job, Everyday goals is to always get customers assisted in a timely manner with proper care. Good team and chemistry help each learn and grow.Must love criticism and fast pace environment."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work at but meanly for students. I've learned so much being there especially about different coffee. Managers and co-workers were great to work with. The most enjoyable part about working there was being able to meet new people everyday. Also developing a relationship with customers.
good,"I've worked at Starbucks in both Vancouver and Whitby (Ontario). A typical day of work involved serving customers, making drinks, and cleaning and organizing the store. I've become better at small talk, and being meticulous and focused when it is required. The hardest part of my job was multitasking, the most enjoyable aspect was being able to work and interact with others simultaneously."
good,"I really loved working there. I enjoy working with my co partners, everything was fun. You get to have fun while working and interacting with customers. I learned having to multitask anything you can think of. It is a really fun job."
good,Fast paced environment that doesn't give you much down time. It's easy to stay busy and there's is always the need to either make or prep things so it's nice to be hands on. Tends to get hard to get bored
good,"Definitely worth working for the company. You really get to know everyone and connect with them, I guess like most other jobs out there, but it's hardly a bad day when working with people you enjoy being around. Great benefits, good pay, rarely bored unless you really try, and always something to do, even during down time. Management wasn't the best though."
good,A typical day at Starbucks is fun and exhilarating. There is a continuous rush of people and always something to do. You build great relationships with customers and your coworkers that give your time a Starbucks one to remember.
good,serve the customer and make a coffee. get more friendly to customer. a very nice partner to do work. the hardest part of job is when busy to make a beverages. the most enjoyable job i ever work
good,"During my past 2 years at a Starbucks licensed store, I have met some of my best friends while working in an environment that is both challenging, exciting, and rewarding. I have learned some of my most valuable career skills including multi-tasking and time-management."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work part-time, however after a while it can get old. Regardless, your co-workers are great, and you pick up essential customer service skills."
good,If you are in college or just looking for a fun fast paced job. Starbucks is a great place to go. I have worked here for almost two full years and am now looking at higher job opportunities in or close to my field of study.
good,"Nice place to work , free pound of coffee per week and endless coffee while you work, cant loose. great 401k program, easy place to work."
good,"I loved the staff and the ambiance at work, however I did not like the new manager that was a lot more strict and bossy than the previous one we had... He did not managed well the store and was not very welcoming. I still learned a lot from working there, they have a great clientele and the shifts were very variable which made the job different every day."
good,"Starbucks is a company that takes care of their employees. I was provided with much opportunity to advance within this company. The atmosphere was very high energy and sometimes exhausting. However, the work ethic of our team and friendly connections I made with co-workers made this experience very enjoyable. Working at Starbucks was a great opportunity for learning how to be a valuable team player. It was also a great environment for learning to use exceptional customer service skills. Feeling valued as a vital partner in Starbucks Corp. was my favorite part of the job. I was offered endless opportunity as well as receiving respect as an employee. The 4 am shifts were challenging but overall the experience of working at Starbucks was a positive one."
good,"Learned how to make drinks, and prepare food for customers to eat. Also learned communication skills among coworkers and customers as well. A typical day begins to become quite mundane as the routine is simple and not challenging. The hardest part of the job was simply to remember all the regular customers by name and their basic background because customer care is heavily encouraged."
good,I love working for Starbucks. I am proud to be part of a company that is so involved in its community and invested in its people. Having worked here for over five years I would highly recommend the job to anyone who is looking for a flexible position with opportunities for advancement. Hardest part can be people getting mad at you for giving them the wrong drink.
good,I think my work place is pretty busy i love being able to connect with people on a daily basis . I've learned so many things at Starbucks I've learned to have a lot of patience with people and some coworkers. The management is good they do what need to be done but they are still trying to get used to and get into the routines of Starbucks. My coworkers are great there are some that can be lazy but that is when patience comes into play and maybe talking to manager if the coworker continues on being lazy. Most of my coworkers are a pleasure to work with and I love each and everyone of them . I think the hardest part of working at Starbucks is deep cleaning when you are working alone because that means you have to take care of guest and clean and do daily task at the same time . The most enjoyable part of the job for me is interacting with the guest and seeing them on a daily basis knowing that if there having a bad day i can change a their day one coffee at a time .
good,A company with a strong employee centered culture.  As a salaried manager at any level the work/life balance is demanding and can be difficult for some to manage effectively.
good,"The Pros: Benefits are wonderful. Plenty of breaks and 30 min lunches. They are always looking for partners to promote from within and reward hard work. They offer plenty of education programs to help you grow in the industry. "
good,"I got hired when I was in high school, the manager worked with my school schedule, which My co-workers were nice for the most part. I learned how to do Drive-thru and use the cash till."
good,"The space is small and tight, it was fast paste and because we were alone it was harder. costumers would get impatient and upset at times. "
good,"Starbucks is an upstanding company that goes out of its way to provide for its employees. The management is constantly thinking of ways to make the partners feel appreciated and heard. Starbucks is always thinking of ways to help its partners grow in their jobs and, with the addition of fully paid college tuition, gives a chance for partners to move up or move on."
good,Each day starts with a morning stand-up with the scrum team and then we all go off to work on our tasks. Management is very friendly and down to earth. I was able to learn the value of good project set up and different test project designs.
good,"A typical day of work at Starbucks basically consisted of cleaning, start to finish, and ensuring customers are taken care of quickly and with care. I learned that there is always something to clean, and always something to do. The managers I had at Starbucks were very hands on when need be, but excellent at knowing when to step back from the work. My co-workers were most definitely my favorite part of the job, because where I worked we were all close and took care of one another. The hardest part of the job was occasionally closing the store at 10:30PM, then coming back in to open at 3:30AM. The most enjoyable part of the job was the camaraderie between partners, and working through incredibly busy periods of time with some of my best friends."
good,A typical day at work would be very fast past and stressful. I learned how to handle myself under pressure. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers and the bonds I developed with customers. (Sometimes customers would bring me presents!)
good,"Overall I really enjoyed my time at Starbucks. At the store I worked at there was awesome management as well as co-workers. There were different positions so you didn't usually end up doing the same thing everyday. The pay wasn't that great but they did offer lots of benefits, which if you needed them definitely made it worth it to work there. You also got free drinks and merchandise as well as discounts on things that weren't free. Another thin to remember is that it's Starbucks, everyone has heard of it and it's pretty constantly busy. The company really focused on speed and consistency more than anything. That made the energy of the store a little more tense, especially because it had a drive thru. I think I would have preferred to work in a lobby only store, but that's just my personal preference. They also give you ten minute breaks about every two hours and a thirty minute lunch if you worked more than seven hours."
good,"a very high paced and energetic environment, a lot of room for growth if your willing to put in the work. I was fully trained and supported in each job level. when you get to management however, it is very difficult to maintain a work life balance(you're never really ""off""). I learned to work with a strong and diverse group of people, the company culture is to be welcoming to all including customers."
good,Starbucks is overall a good company to work even though they are a large corporation they truly care about their employees and offer wonderful perks.  I enjoyed my team and liked being part of the management team.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is working with likeminded people, able to help each other, we also get to build a rapport with our regular guests."
good,"Starbucks has been a part of my life for over two years now, and it is definitely more than getting someone's coffee and warming up their cheese danish. As some partners like to say ""if you can lean, you can clean."" Some would define this as busywork, but overall, there is tons of work to do and drinks to make. I have learned to communicate and connect with customers on a professional and personal level. Memorizing drinks and the point of sales system is the easy part if you ask me. Dealing with coworkers who have an equal or greater work ethic makes the job a lot easier, however, there have been plenty of cases of working with people who simply do not want to work. That is the hardest part of the job, especially as a manager. Trying to keep everyone on the same page can be difficult when certain people have their own way of doing things. On the contrary, I love my coworkers. Most of my coworkers have become a part of my life outside of work. Although I do not plan on making a career out of Starbucks, I will definitely have a hard time saying goodbye."
good,I definitely enjoyed the fast paced and customer relation building this job had to offer. Management is always considerate of their employees needs. I learned a lot of time management skills at this job. Although it is a lot of work for the pay. But I had fun.
good,"Having been both an Assistant Manager and a student employee of Starbucks I have to say, I did not enjoy the management side of this company. However, this is one of the best student jobs available!"
good,my experience at Starbucks has taught me how to be a task master and prioritize to get multiple thing done at once . moving from different areas over time helps a long shift go by on a busy day. Working for starbucks has kept me with much decepline and  great customer service skills. and how to also connect with customers by remembering their names and others things to build reltionships with customers.
good,"I worked with one of the best teams at a drive-thru that was open from 5am-1:30am. I had the an awesome team that became friends with outside of work, management included. I had a few regular customers who appreciated me having their order memorized. There is the occasional angry customer who complains about their drink but my team was on the job! Both staff and customers are really friendly and good to get along with plus the awesome benefits helped me get a much needed pair of new glasses and a trip to the dentist. To top it off, I pretty much had free starbucks whenever I wanted!"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. It brings people together, very social. Opportunities are endless. Great management, great teamwork, family fill. This is also a very fast paced job. Lots of multitasking. My favorite part of the job is customer service and making someone's day."
good,"Love working for this company, fast paced and different every day. If you're looking to move up there is opportunity, but it requires lots of outside hours if you're going to run the business and work on personal development. If your DM is like mine there's lots of support and room for growth, but I know this is not always the case."
good,A really great place to work. I have learned to navigate in a busy environment while maintaining great customer service.
good,"Great place to work"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting compliments on your hand crafted beverage. It is a place that can really teach you to have a sense of urgency.
good,"Working at Starbucks is an amazing experience. The people who work there are very friendly and helpful to new employees. Although the management is very strict, they do still respect your personal struggles (ie. mental health). Helping the customers and learning how to make the drinks is by the far the most enjoyable."
good,"Starbucks has been a great place to work while going to school and raising a child. They have been really flexible with my availability, making sure to schedule me enough hours and still respecting my other priorities. I've had the pleasure of getting to work with some really great people while working at Starbucks, who are all for the most part working towards educational and career goals. The fast pace environment and emphasis on customer service has helped me to grow and handle stressful situations effectively."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work! the benefits are great, the opportunities are innumerable, the wage is slightly better than minimum! my only complaint would be the inconsistent availability of hours, and slow to the draw management. over all, my experience working at Starbucks has been the best work experience I've had."
good,"Typically, I worked in the mornings. It was smooth sailing right off the bat if you know what your procedures are. Starting with turning on and cleaning our espresso machines, followed by grinding coffee beans for full batches. Start brewing iced teas and ice coffees, and then begin to set up the pastry case. "
good,"My experience with Starbucks will never be forgotten. I gained skills that are transferable in the any workplace."
good,As a part-time barista I worked with a wonderful store manager and equally positive team leads. Time moved quickly in a positive environment with good coworkers and chances to engage customers. A typical work day started early to open the store but time moved quickly and there were very few negative experiences. For a part-time supplemental position the pay wasn't bad but it definitely was low for someone looking at the job as a sole support. The hardest part of the job was learning the variables for the different drinks and performing quickly enough to move a large number of orders through in a short time. The best part of the job was being in an environment designed to foster social interactions.
good,"At a typical day at work as a Shift Supervisor I have to either prepare to set up or close down a store. During my shift numerous things can happen which forces me to remain flexible. If we are out of a certain pastry I have to pull enough to last during my shift and through the next. I have to make executive decisions for the best of the store, putting my team where they are best equipped per their own personal set of skills. If a partner calls out sick I have to find coverage in a timely and effective manner. When peak hits, I have to make sure my team is ready, stocked, and energized with a positive outlook to the day. I prep deposits, pull pastries for the day/night, make sure health and ECOsure procedures are in place, and do it all while smiling and giving customers my utmost attention. I have learned to juggle, because as a supervisor you have a long period of time to work but various tasks that must get accomplished to ensure a perfectly run store. The hardest part of the job is making a decision which is best for my team or the customer, most of the time I will have to make a choice that benefits both parties. My most enjoyable part of the job is the tight bonds established between my partners and my customers."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. My hours were flexible. All my co workers were friendly. I learned how to deal with people and how to deal with pressure in an efficient way.
good,Loved working there. I took another offer that was shown to be better and it really wasn't. Would love to go back if I could.
good,As a store manager the pressure was overwhelming. I succeeded in all of my store and sales goals. The best part of my job was team development and helping my employees grow and succeed in the areas that interest  them.
good,I loved working for Starbucks!  they went out of their way to do more than pay lip service to the employee's experience.  Advancement was never difficult as a Starbucks partner and when the management at this company said their dorrs were always open they meant it.  I always felt I was making an important contribution to this company and would highly recommend them to a friend!
good,"Pretty nice environment. The costumers kind of sucked though, because everyone is in a rush and you just want to be happy"
good,"This company has really helped me advance my career, great opportunities and benefits along with culture and environment . I have met amazing talent and have truly been inspired to progress and move forward with my career in management. "
good,"What I have learned is when a barista is able to actively use the training I have given to create an environment that is healthy for everyone involved, baristas want to work harder and learn more."
good,Working at Starbucks is really great. I learned how to be more sociable and how to interact with complete strangers. The environment is friendly and my coworkers are all nice people. I usually make drinks most of the time (which is my favorite thing to do) but occasionally I have to use the cash register. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with huge groups of people ordering drinks at the same time and customers who have had a bad day and decide to take it out on us.
good,"what i learned: "
good,"I have learned a lot of thing in Starbucks. "
good,"A day in the life at starbucks was always new and challenging. You could expect your regulars to come in at the same time everyday, however there was always new faces and obstacles everyday. The management at starbucks in my experience always had kept everything very light hearted while keeping all employees on task and motivated. The hardest part was morning rush which ironically enough was always the most fun part of the day. Especially with a proper crew."
good,"A typical day at work included food handling and customer servicing. Cleaning, replenishment of items that were short on hand was common. As is the creation and accurately concocting each beverage--coffee, tea, etc. The hardest part of the job is learning the recipes, but that becomes easier as you gain more exposure. The most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere that is given off by a coffee shop."
good,"A great work environment. Even the unpredictability of a rush or customers makes it a thrilling place to be. There is always something to do, which makes it a pretty engaging job experience. If you have any interest in working in the food business, this is the best place to start."
good,I have been with Starbucks for over two years and have met so many amazing people through the company. This job has taught me what customer service is all about and how to work in a team environment. It is non stop and there is always something to do!
good,very early start very productive day Ive learned to be team player  management could work on some things and effective communication
good,"I really enjoyed my job at Starbucks for the most part. My fellow partners were encouraging and helpful. The days went by fairly fast due to the constant flow of people coming and going. The only things I didn't like were 1) the inability to change schedule 2) the inability to transfer closer to my home. I was driving 45 minutes there each day and was often late. I notified my store manager how far away I lived and would be looking to transfer ASAP, but it didn't seem to matter."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you aren't in management. They have set unrealistic expectations and they are going down a very black and white path right now. 6 months ago, I would have a different review but I am extremely disappointed in Starbucks right now."
good,"Pros: Fun atmosphere. 30% discounts. One free food. Free coffee. Education programs. Self driven advancements. "
good,They pay well and the atmosphere is enjoyable to work in. sometimes the bosses are very stingy but i guess thats their job
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is fast paced, challenging, and fun. As a Retail Manager I learned a lot about the farming, production, and distribution of the various coffee beans and tea.  Also, I learned quite a bit about corporate practices and jargon.  My favorite part about the job, on a daily basis, was the interaction with my employees and customers and making genuine connections."
good,"Working at Starbucks has given me the ability to communicate, and to build relationships with my customers as well with my co-workers. A typical day at work is multitasking, organizing, cleanliness of store, up selling product, presentation, working with others in difficult situations also handling situations in a tactful matter. Management is very professional at Starbucks, well organized and making sure our partners are satisfied. Working with my co-workers is the greatest thing I have experienced at Starbucks we all built a family, and always help each other if needed, such as a bad day or helping each other finish our daily task. The hardest part of the job is not having an organized shift, but we all manage through. The most enjoyable part of my job I find is communicating with the customers as well as my co-workers. I have built strong relationships with our every day customers and it feels great to make someones day not realizing that they were were having a bad day until they talked to you."
good,"Is a good place to work, and learn a lot of different skills."
good,"I am thankful to have a job that gives me health insurance, but after 5 years I am not where I want to be in my pay grade, or working a full-time job to be able to afford my bills and rent."
good,Starbucks is a very fun place to work. You learn a lot about leadership and multitasking. I met a lot of great people along the way.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks would be ringing up customers on the register, taking orders, cleaning, maintenance, and overall providing excellent customer service."
good,Very numbers driven but the in store management provides a good environment to enjoy your job. Coworkers are all very nice and loyal to each other. The store is very high volume especially during the holidays
good,"Atención y Servicio al cliente, el saber que día a día se aprendía algo nuevo sobre el café ejemplo elaboración de bebidas de igual forma historia del café."
good,Waking up and being lucky enough to have a job makes my day. Some people have it extremely rough out there so that makes me humble. No matter what job title you have always go in with a smile and leave happy. I always been good with people so I rarely have a bad day.
good,"Fun work place with supportive employees. There are some many people that come in so often and it surprises our customers when we remember their name, drink and what we might have talked about while they waited for their drink the day before."
good,"Giornata tipo iniziava a seconda della tua schedula, che poteva variare da apertura, middle e chiusura."
good,"I love the company, the management team was very well trained. Limitless opportunity for upward mobility within the company. We received constant training, and were coached on how to better ourselves constantly. In this way, we could constantly better ourselves as a team and individually."
good,Surrounded by very experienced and supportive workers with a very understanding manager.  It was a great place to work at!  However very stressful during the mornings and in the lunch rush hour
good,"Got along with employees and customers well, overall enjoyable and professional work atmosphere. Most co-workers we professional and enjoyable to work with, store manager was awesome one of the best I've had."
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks. It is a great company to work for and relatively easy to work your way up."
good,"A typical day at work for me is pieceful, I work alone because I work overnight. I learned a lot about coffee and grew to love Starbucks. What is the con is the management. We barely have enough workers and the management makes it seem like they could care less about there employees."
good,"One of the best companies I have worked for in terms of benefits. Fast paced environment, good pay."
good,"This job was a great place to gain experience in customer service and management. It helped me develop time management, financial planning, and leadership skills."
good,"great job, part-time employee competiton, rewarding benefits, managers shift leads and baristas are enjoyable to work with"
good,i learned how to interact with costumers. I had fun working with my co workers . and learned how to multi task. the hardest part of my job when i was first started to work at starbucks .
good,Working with small team in a coffee shop in the city can have fast  paced days but with many local regulars and newcomers to share a great experience with great coffee.
good,Its the airport so we always stay busy i love my customers and all I enjoy the team work and alli like my mangers co- workers my job everything about it
good,"Starbucks is Company that I have enjoyed working for several years, not only do they care deeply about service and customers specialized drink modification they know how to take care of Partners included. My co-workers are group of amazing people that i've had a pleasure meeting, each one brings a unique insight on how we should operate as a team. As a shift supervisor I see many rough spots between partners if its fatigue, illness or just the monday blues. I like to remind them that this is fun place environment and the day is made to how you see it. I myself have learned a lot in having that mind set I've been able to accomplish many goals in our store from waste management, handling unsatisfied customers."
good,Starbucks is an overall good company. They have great benefits and really take care of their partners and want partners to grow and succeed.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks. The variance in what you could do on a typical day. The rush of people coming in. And meeting people from all walks of life.
good,"I enjoyed making drinks and talking to a lot of people there. But it is that reason that was let go. The drinks, the cleaning, the keep-up of the job is really easy and only takes about a week to get used to things."
good,"When at this job I forget at times I'm working in a work station for the coworkers are full of energy, and are mostly friendly.Although I've had different managers in this company at least two of the three where/are very understanding, and willing to work with me on my availability. Hardest part of the job would undoubtedly be dealing with customers however, it's manageable and can be fun depending on who stops by. The most enjoyable part of this job really is working with the coworkers. Overall as stated above, they can be very friendly and are strong on helping their fellow coworkers."
good,i loved it when i was young.Its a great work experience for people in college are moving on to bigger things in life. You lear about the coffee industry.
good,"I worked for Starbucks for a couple of months while living in California. It's a good job, friendly people, and it teaches important building blocks of information to working as a team. I say that Starbucks is a great beginner job, and don't have many complaints. My only issue is the pay. It is impossible to receive full time hours from this position (Barista) without being in management, and only pays minimum wage according to the state the store is located in. On the other hand, they give out full medical benefits, which is exceedingly rare for a part time job."
good,Working at Starbucks was a great job .Greeting my regular customers were the best part of my job. I had the best manager and worked with the best staff ever.
good,"Starbucks is very hard work, but can be very rewarding when with the right team.  There is more to Starbucks than brewing coffee.  It is dealing with challenges with customers and partners, balancing cleaning tasks, and learning about the Starbucks culture."
good,"Easy to move up within the company. Great benefits. Cares about employees. Great company to work for regardless of your age. Perfect for Students, Full- Time Parents, and as and additional job."
good,"Starbucks is a fast pace work environment with the opportunity of advancement. I have learned to apply myself as a part of a close knit team. The management of the store is well executed. The team works as one. It is important for all of us to do our part to improve the overall success of the store. The hardest part of the day to day tasks is speed. Speed is essential and crucial and we must put out product within 36 to 46 seconds from time of order. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people, both partners and team, and customers as well. Being able to communicate with people in a positive way and help them brighten their day, makes mine that much better."
good,"The days where very busy.  Hardest job I ever worked.  "
good,"A typical day at work involves greeting and taking care of customers all day long. Handling cash and credit transactions, lots of cleaning, and making sure customer's needs are met, and managing a high standard of food and beverage safety. I have learned to become a people person through this job because of meeting so many different types of people through the hours of the day and through all the years I have been with the company. My manager is a wonderful woman to work with, she cares about her staff, and my co-workers and I are like a family that all works together and gets along. The hardest part of this job I would say is trying to not let the occasional rude customer get you down and the most enjoyable part is making the customers happy and seeing them return the next day."
good,"This job increases your ability to perform in a fast-paced customer service environment. The hardest part of this job is balancing all the information that comes with this position; i.e. coffee knowledge, weekly promotional items, as well as sales/marketing strategies. The most enjoyable part of this job was satisfying customer's daily needs and seeing smiles on their faces."
good,easy enviroment to work in Mgmt postion could be a lil stressfull but overall good company. and you get to meet interesting people depending on location
good,"I liked working at Starbucks because they have good benefits and I enjoy working with customers a lot. You're expected to work extremely quick while doing everything to perfection. Customer rushes were a common occurrence, especially on mornings and Saturdays. "
good,"Open store, set up pastry case/coffee bar. Greet customers and prepare quality pastry and beverages for them. "
good,"made coffee, learned great customer service, learned how to manage a small team. Easy to balance work and school, management was fine, some mistakes in supply chain management during the seasons change. Hardest part was maintaining an open communication between district and store. I enjoyed customer service part, making people smile and creating relationships."
good,"The coffee and cake is free. The people are friendly. Higher class customers, and the benefits are insane. The hours can be long and can feel just like any other fast food restaurant."
good,"My job usually involves day to day activities such as making drinks and taking care of customers. I learned a lot while working here because of the confidence the team and management instilled in me. Soon, I found myself doing more tasks, that I would have felt uncomfortable doing because prior to the job I really didn't have a lot of confidence in myself. However, they worked with me and my school schedule allowing me to graduate and still have a job."
good,My experience with Starbucks was usually fast pace and busy. I learned how to communicate better with my fellow partners and customers. I also learned how to handle under pressure situations in a professional way.
good,"I loved working with all the people that i did, always had someone to talk to if i was going through struggles worked related or not. I always felt wanted and needed there, and got an decent amount of hours. Pay could have been increased for the amount of work expected, and advancement was offered but took months to even begin."
good,Very flexible company to work for.  My career was on hold as I was raising children.  Starbucks  was a perfect part time job that I could work at while being home with my children.   Great mgmt and opportunities if interested.
good,"Makes drinks according to company standards"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was the communication the partners had, the fun even in the rough times when management was out of whack or not even there. Partners understood when things were rough for the shift supervisors or assistant store managers and helped remind us that keeping calm and having good vibes is not just the shift's job, but the barista's as well. With all the positivity flowing  around we had regular customers nearly every hour everyday, all of which knew each barista working."
good,"No two days at the 'Bux are ever the same. Every customer, every drink, every day, every partner is different. At my specific Starbucks, I had rockstar management who did every single thing they could do meet the needs of every partner, in any way they could. Our tips rocked because we rocked. The job is hard; extremely crazy mornings and late nights, mile-long lines and arm-covering burns but you will often make someone's day, too. The company does what they can to ensure a variety of benefits for working the insane job that we do-- from pay to medical benefits to free food and drinks. If you can keep your cool and don't mind getting down and dirty, you're past half way there. Sometimes it takes your whole lunch break to brush the dirt off of your psyche, but more often than not, your teams got your back, and your regulars treat you like family. A great job for young people that need structure and money. A great learning experience. Lifes a cup'o'joe."
good,"Great Management, Great co-workers and even greater customers!"
good,"Management- I did not enjoy receiving write ups for asking questions about safety concerns"
good,"It was definitely fast paced. My co-workers and i had to work as a team to get through the day. If one person was not doing well, it would affect the whole team. I have had three managers while i have worked for Starbucks. Overall I think my management has been well. Starbucks' regulations kept them checking up with us, baristas, which really helped us figure out how well we are doing. I definitely learned how to handle people of any personality and mood. I loved closing. that was my favorite shift to work."
good,"Customers are the highlight of your day "
good,"Depending on your personality and how you respond to your coworkers and management, you will either love or hate this job. Starbucks is a great company to work for, but each store is an island of culture, who knows what you'll get until you work there."
good,I really enjoyed my job. I only worked as a temp. at the time. I would love to be a fulltime worker here. The people that worked there were great.
good,"The management is very good, they work with your schedule and rotate positions throughout the day. A typical day begins with the morning peak rush, which can bring in as many as 75 people per 30 minutes. Baristas must accommodate all customers' needs while performing their daily duties."
good,A Typical day at work is jumping right into action when on the floor. While working you look around to see what has been done and what needs to be done. Also see where your co-workers need you the most. Management oversee to make sure the staff is working and continues their job. The hardest part of my job the lack of satisfaction I feel after a long day of work. I feel as if I should be doing more then working for Starbucks. The most enjoyable part of my day is the people I work with and the customer who I have connected with on a daily basis.
good,"There is constant interaction with a variety of customers nearly every moment of the day where I've had to learn how to balance tasks with serving while keeping an upbeat attitude. "
good,"very fast paced"
good,"While working at Starbucks, I worked as a team leader. My job was to guide and coach other partners through a successful shift."
good,"Usually fun, good people, the company does a lot to show it cares about its employees. Of course this all depends on the store manager you end up with"
good,"Working at Starbucks gives you the benefit of working in a responsible, friendly environment with the bonus of having the knowledge of how to make those wild drinks people drink every day. My favorite part of my job was being able to make a difference in someone's day, either by serving them their favorite drink or just by offering a smile. Working here taught me how to work under pressure and how to connect with others. The hardest part about Starbucks is the pace you have to work at to be able to succeed. Long lines and complicated drink orders, along with difficult customers can be very stressful but learning to trust your team makes it easier. And the accomplishment of getting through a rush helps you learn each time."
good,It was hard work but I loved the stressful work environment. Free pound of coffee every week and Tips made the job even better.
good,Starbucks was a fast pace environment with an enthusiastic team. The best part of my job was definitely my customers. The hardest part was trying to run breaks while we had a line of customers out the door. The general manger was caring but a little to much to deal with at times. I learned to be patient with partners learning ability and how to efficiently run a floor daily.
good,"Don't get me wrong, I love working at Starbucks, but the 8 hours on your feet kind of thing is the only thing that I don't like."
good,"Good environment, amazing benefits, love the partners there. I had no regrets. The management were fun but very proactive throughout the work day."
good,Working at Starbucks was GREAT for my college life schedule. I worked there my entire time in undergrad. I loved how flexible my schedule could be. I also received full benefits even though I was part time. The job can be pretty stressful. Customers and coffee is always a tense experience. Working in a small space with your coworkers in an environment that is highly demanding physically and mentally can sometimes cause some job culture strife.
good,"Very busy. Always keeping you busy whether it's making drinks, customer service, or cleaning. Fun workplace. Very relaxed during downtime,"
good,The morning-shift atmosphere is fast-paced and exhilarating.  The night shift is relaxing. Closing is the most fun you will ever have! Starbucks does a great job of choosing manager and shift leaders.
good,"I am very thankful for my job at Starbucks. I have received medical benefits as a part time employee, as each partner only has to work 20 hours per week to get medical coverage! Starbucks is also now providing a free college education to employees who have not received their bachelor's degree."
good,"My four years at Starbucks were a great experience for me, I worked under several different managers and was able to develop my own experience by working at three different stores here in California. I learned from my mangers and was able to work with them to help develop fellow baristas. Sometimes the hardest part of the job was the obstacles, challenges really, when a machine would break down or someone would call out or maybe you ran out of something, but that was also one of the fun parts because the team works together to overcome a tough situation."
good,"Start work at 5:30am prepping the coffee and setting up the store to welcome the customers at 6:00am, everyday is a learning experience, from ringing up coffee to making it. Management has room for improvement. My co-workers are always bringing excitement to the floor and teamwork. Hardest part of the day, I would say would be from 8:00am to 10:00 when minimal to moderate rush occur meaning (flow of customers per transaction). Most enjoyable part of the day would be interacting with the customers."
good,"A typical day at work would be fast paced, serve customers, conversations with customers, count money, train employees, count inventory and clean the store. I learned how to have patience with other employees, and customers. Working at Starbucks has showed me many new things in life."
good,Everyday there was an amazing customer connection.  The benefits are also great.  The company has an amazing mission statement and is very involved in every community in which the company does business.
good,"I genuinely enjoyed working for Tom Thumb, my only reason for leaving was not being able to leave my department."
good,i am so friendly with staff.and focusing on the need.and always ready to help. and fully engaged with customer in friendly.
good,"Honestly I will say Starbucks is a wonderful place and company to work for. It is a very fast paced on your toes job. I've been with the company for a little over two in a half years and I can honestly say that I have created a lot of memorable moments here, not only with my team but with a lot of the customers. although trying to live on Starbucks is not recommended due to hours being so inconsistent to honestly I feel low pay. But if you are committed then you will be okay. heck ive made it work. benefits are awesome and the choice to start a 401K couldn't have been happier."
good,An employee must by quick on their toes. Be able to take constructive criticism on the fly.  Be great at multi-tasking.  Have a calm demeanor to grouchy customers
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great way to refine your people skills. It teaches you patience and hospitality, as well as making killer drinks. We work as a team and as a single unit, we make everything work like clockwork, each playing to our strengths and making customers happy. I love seeing our regulars and making people happy when I am able to personalize an experience by knowing their drink and their name, it makes for a very pleasant place to work. The hardest thing is probably keeping all the drinks straight and finding time to do things outside of work, especially as someone who closes as often as I do, but the people who I work with make up for it."
good,"Starbucks was never meant to be a life-long career for me, but it certainly can be and has been for several people I know. There are several ongoing opportunities for growth and advancement. With Starbucks, there are limitless opportunities for development. With that said, the pay for the first few stepping stones isn't enough to live on, or at least it wasn't in my day. On the other side of that, there's an excellent benefits package that they offer to both full-time and part-time workers, which is practically unheard of. They also offer tuition reimbursement and stock options, which is why the employees are referred to as partners. Every employee, or partner, actually owns a little part of the company. They're a wonderful company to work for, and I learned many valuable life skills while I was a part of the team. They have a wonderful business model and they really care about the partners, the customers, the community, and the environment. Great company."
good,Great coworkers and environment. A great place to pick up customer service skills. A very fast paced job. Sometimes the sheer number of customers could get overwhelming. Making customers leave happy made it worth while.
good,A very understanding business when it comes to school schedules. They believe in having a good quality work experience and the pay is decent for a retail/cafe job.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paste and busy."
good,"The store location is always busy yet reasonably staffed with productive partners and good shift supervisors."
good,"I learned patience and productivity."
good,"Having worked in high-volume business stores, I feel I have learned a great deal on multitasking, task management, supervisory skills, and organization throughout my six years with Starbucks. Each day is different, presenting different challenges and experiences to help one continually learn and grown."
good,"It is a good job to earn some cash while going to school, however moving up as a supervisor is not worth the pay that come with much greater responsibility."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Starbucks as a Shift Supervisor and as a Barista.  The best part of my day was seeing the customers smiling as I handed them their daily drinks.  I met a lot of amazing people, customers and employees."
good,"Now of course it get pretty crazy every once an a while but that's because customers love Starbucks. "
good,"It looks like a caring place & very friendly people"
good,"Learned how to make great drinks"
good,"Although it was the 2nd busiest Starbucks in the city, it was an awesome work experience. The Customers, Co-workers, and Managers were great to work with and around, even in difficult situations. There were many great employee benefits, and job enhancements."
good,"Working at a Starbucks Coffee location in the financial district in San Francisco, CA, each day was quite busy. I had a great relationship with my co-workers and we served many thousands of customers per day. Due to the nature of our customers being in a hurry, one was required to produce a quality product that they love in a short amount of time. The hardest part of the job was sometimes being understaffed and having to compensate with a workload that should have been divided between two or three people. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was connecting with a large variety of different people and making a good product that one takes pride in."
good,"I worked with an amazingly fun team, and that had a direct effect on my attitude. Especially clocking in a 4 am."
good,"great place to work. mostly worked opening shift which was the busiest time of the day ""morning rush"" and some what the hardest because customers haven't had their morning coffee. i really enjoyed meeting new people everyday and also reconnecting with daily customers."
good,"A very busy and customer orientated atmosphere. A place where be personable is a much needed trait. The workers come from all different walks of life, which make the interactions between each other interesting. The hardest part of the job is the multitasking. Between seeing customers and doing other daily task it can get very hectic. However, during downtime, you tend to have great conversations with the workers and the customers. You may even end up making life long friendship and making great connections."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. Seeing  our awesome regular costumers on a daily basis makes work so much fun. Getting the store ready for the day can be stressful if the co workers who worked the night before didn't do their job properly, but in the morning we can and do fix it and none of our customers know. All my co workers are awesome, everyone pretty much gets along but like with any job some people are not as sweet or can be a pain to work with. The hardest part about the job is the rudeness of customers, but I do strive to make sure they still leave my store satisfied at their time at Starbucks. I do enjoy my job but after 9 yrs, it is getting tiring and I am looking and ready for a new change. Some of my favorite customers make my job so much easier, they can tell and so can some of my co workers, who have become close friends, can tell if something is bothering me. My store I work at is like a big crazy family and its awesome. I will miss them  all but a new and better change is more important for me."
good,"Work days are fly by quickly by making beverages, cleaning the facility, and honing coffee knowledge."
good,"O dia a dia era na maioria das vezes bem corrido, principalmente aos finais de semana e feirados."
good,"have learn t how to deal with all kinds of customers,good team work with co-workers,dealing with hard customers,making friends with customers."
good,"Quickly became a  Certified Barista Trainer by exhibiting my passion and commitment to my customers "
good,"It's a good place to start working or to work part time while you are studying. Depends on the store, the job it is more or less demanding,  however you are tough the same skills everywhere. Also it is a good company to grow if you do not have higher studies due to you will receive all the formation needed from them"
good,"-usually on register"
good,"They trained me properly, though sadly training is rather shortened at this point. The management at my store was ever changing and at times getting a hold of the higher ups was an issue. A typical day for me was the night shift, coming in helping customers while cleaning the store, stocking inventory, receiving new inventory, and assuring team speed/task completion with quality at the top of the priority list. Quality over product being served, customer to employee relation and of store cleanliness. Management of money was a vast portion of the work involved, working to improve sales and watching the cash drawers making sure everyone was in task and all money was accounted for. Setting up for the following day to assure the flow of the store in the morning is fast and successful. Hardest part of the job was stress management, and having to stand on your feet all day, even then it was a fairly easy job. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers meeting new and interesting people every day and making a beverage that I enjoyed making."
good,"The 7 years with Starbucks was very challenging and taught me note about management than any other company. Very involved training, and manager peer support."
good,"Really loved my hours, work hours and days were flexible, mgt was awesome when I worked there. Very fun!"
good,"- Supports store manager in implementing company programs by working directly with shift team to execute action plans that meet operational and Organisation objectives."
good,I have yet to see a company that cares about their workers more than Starbucks. Great team of managers at almost every store I walked into as well as a excellently trained team. The shift are usually pretty typical in length ranging from 4-8 hours. You get free drinks all day and a discount off all the food which at a 4 am shift coffee is a must. Its very very busy and can be rather challenging if you aren't a skilled multi tasker. The company gives every store all the resources you need to be successful so if you just follow the standards and show up it can be very easy to move through the comapany
good,Had a great experience in meeting new people and an even better time making great friends.
good,"As a barista working in the afternoon, other than dealing with customers, your primary job is to clean everything. Either (almost) everything behind the counter, or the rest of the store (sweeping, moping, bathrooms, restocking)."
good,Extremely busy location requiring a skilled multi-tasker.  Great customers and management is talented.
good,"I keep myself busy during lean hours and I make every customer's day at the store worthwhile and uplifting. I have learned in this line of work that I should always maintain my composure especially when dealing with the customers as well as my partners. Though the culture in Starbucks is kind of laid back (no seniority), I still make sure that I give respect to my management team and my co-workers so that I also earn their respect. For me, the hardest part of my job is to make sure that every partner in our store stays as passionate as I am when it comes to work and maintain their proper work ethics. "
good,"A Typical day at work is pretty upbeat and fast paced. I learned how to mix cold beverages, mix whipped creams, grind coffee, ect. The management and the co- workers are not as professional as they should be. The hardest part of my job is having to do store support and make sure everything is kept stocked and easily accessible. I love to help people and bring joy to their days."
good,"During my stay at Starbucks Philippines Inc., I was mostly assigned in an office building. I was one of the pioneers of that newly opened store late August of last year. I enjoyed how my typical everyday went. I would be assigned mostly as an opener, therefore, I get to serve morning customers, and throughout the afternoon till 4pm. The working environment was very fun and light, even with the pressure of the Christmas season kicking in, because of the very calm approach of my manager and barista trainer. My manager was firm and straight with his comments and constructive feedbacks, which helped me develop more my responsibilities, duties and passion and motivated me to be better. Also, my manager would always give us opportunities for position promotions, titles and awards."
good,"Vey nice location for work, the teamwork is amazing and the customer very variable"
good,I was able to cross train into different areas of the store as well as have a flexible schedule. If I ever had an issue there was always someone to talk to who could help.
good,"This is a great experience, and not only a very fun job, close to school, also very lovable co-workers. I learned a lot, from how to make/serve coffee, to how to interact with different kind of customers."
good,Great place to learn how to be a manager and fun to work.  Not as much room for advancement after store manager
good,Its an awesome job if you're still going to school. They're super flexible with hours but hours are not always guaranteed.
good,"Great benefits, great company. Unfortunately moving from Atlanta to "
good,"Its a very good first job, learn variety of lessons. Meet many great people, good company to work for. Learn new skills that apply to real world."
good,"Great company with many benefits, and the coffee is amazing."
good,Great company to work for. Being able to work part-time and sill receive full benefits has been great. It allows employees like me to go to school or have another job.
good,"Although many tasks become routinely, second nature intuition go hand in hand with the baristas working in order to provide the best of possible service to our customers. Taking action ahead and predicting what the customer needs before they ask would define the type of mentality Starbucks individuals need to have. I believe this plays a very important role among many other careers such as an assistant and knowing what needs to be done and what should be done before anyone asks. More importantly, I have dealt with extremely stressful situations where I had to be precise and accurate with many drink orders and make sure that we have our customers in and out in under three minutes of their order which would be the most difficult part of the job."
good,This job is a wonderful way to interact with new people daily as well as develop friendships with co-workers easily. The work is manageable and fun with little stress. The learning curve is very steep at first as there are lots of barista basics to cover but everyone is easy to approach and ask questions. The ability to be promoted is based on work ethic and people skills and is approached very seriously. I was happy my manager saw the potential in me to no only be a Shift Supervisor but also a Assistant Manager. It is a great side job but I would like to pursue something more in line with my educational degree
good,"I truly loved working here. My manager was so awesome and helped fit my work schedule with my school schedule. My coworkers were really laid back and always willing to help if you had a question or were curious about anything. My typical day at work was in the morning, and we would get swamped with customers. I learned the importance of time management, being fast and efficient, and how to be the best in customer service. The hardest part of the job was the customers and trying to make as many quality drinks as possible. I was always on bar(making the drinks) and that is the most stressful position. The most enjoyable part was my team of coworkers. They always had my back, knew when something was wrong and tried to fix it, and so much more. They were like a family to me. I definitely don't think this job is suitable for teens (younger than 18) because you have to really be mature at this job, especially when customers are in a bad mood. It also doesn't work well for the business and most state laws to have a teenager in high school to work here because of the scheduling (trust me). The teenagers I did work with took longer to catch on to the flow of things and how to treat customers (rolled their eyes a lot, get very distracted, slow, etc.). It was just frustrating sometimes when we were super busy and they were slow and not understanding that this is a fast paced environment. Overall, I loved this job and I wish I still worked at a Starbucks before I moved for college."
good,"Starbucks Target is a great place to work! The Team members are fun, hardworking and great team players. Our Team leaders are very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly."
good,"Long training period, and it takes a while to feel confident "
good,"Fast paced and energetic, high expectation for rapid production. "
good,"Great team, very busy, a lot of pressure and responsibility"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers, be they regulars or first timers and providing them with beverages on request or recommending beverages to those whom had not been to Starbucks before. I learned how to make coffee and how to work the machines on site. My manager was very friendly and understanding and my co-workers were always a delight to be around. The hardest part of the job was learning to multi-task and keep an eye on many different things occurring simultaneously, such as the timer on the coffee machines/for the milk dispensers. The most enjoyable part of the job was ensuring that people left the cash register with a smile on their faces."
good,"I worked for the company for almost 12 years.  From a barista (making drinks) to manager, I got to see a lot of what the company had to offer.  I've worked from Virginia beach to Williamsburg, the great thing is that if you don't get the hours at your home store, you can always pick up shifts at other stores.  Corporate stores that is, not the one's inside target etc. The pay is competitive and the fun coworkers made the day fly by.  Customers, although some can be rude, overall are wonderful.  The regular customers are like family and it's always fun making a once-a-month coffee drinker to an everyday regular.  Benefits are wonderful, from stock options to free coffee, it really is a nice place to work.  The owner has done so many things to make the company what it is today."
good,If you come into work with a right mind frame then you will be fine.
good,LOVE the company; HATE the wages.  LOVE the benefits; HATE the wages.  LOVE the free coffee; HATE the wages.  Did I mention how awful the wages are?
good,I always met new people and had fun with my coworkers. I learned how to work well with others and how to be more socailab le with customers
good,Typically very busy. Customers are usually very nice and friendly. Managers are extremely understanding and helpful
good,"You would think thank this is a very good place to work but... THe management is bad, turnover is bad, coworkers talk about eachother(DRAMA, DRAMA, DRAMA). but somehow i like working there. My manager clopens me alot. i hate it. i told her about it but she just keeps doing it."
good,Typically very busy. Customers are usually very nice and friendly. Managers are extremely understanding and helpful.
good,Fun environment and very interactive with customers.  There is never a dull moment.
good,"CDR Connect Discover Respond "
good,"Starbucks is a friendly environment to work in. The long term benefits of working there are definitely a plus. I have learned a few things about myself, including that I tend to inspire confidence in others that I may work with and that I can also ease a situation with difficult customers. I have developed a greater appreciation for those in the food industry. I would have to say the biggest adjustment is dealing with difficult customers. The way I and most of my other coworkers adjust to that is to look forward to dealing with the nicer ones. In that I mean understanding that not all customers are going to react the same and to adjust accordingly to whatever the situation demands."
good,"On my  first day at Starbucks I was waiting outside and when manager being informed she requested me to wait for 20 minutes  and ask me what kind of coffee I liked. She handed the tall  pike place coffee as I like it. I really enjoyed it on that winter morning."
good,"served up 2000 customers per day "
good,Working there I was treated nicely and I had the chance to advance in the company when I wanted to.
good,working at starbucks is very enjoyable . you get to meet new people
good,"i enjoying working there as you all ways do different tasks, i like coffee."
good,"Established Company, Great Benefits"
good,Ik heb bij starbucks mijn communicatieve vaardigheden verbeterd. Het was niet altijd makkelijk omdat het op amsterdam centraal lag dus erg druk kon zijn. Gelukkig ging het wel altijd goed en aan het eind van de dag had ik een voldaan gevoel wanneer ik naar huis ging.
good,"Working at Starbucks has taught me so much more than I had ever expected to learn from a job. From multitasking to working with people and how to be part of a team. The company itself focused on human connection and really pushed for a certain level of consistency whether its towards the beverages or with the workers. What I really did like was that the company did care a lot for the workers. They offered full healthcare coverage, flexible schedules, tuition reimbursement, internships, tips, etc. The hardest part about the job is that the hours and schedule weren't as conventional as other jobs i.e. 4:30am-1pm Shifts."
good,I work with awesome people every single day.  I come in I get my work done and I have fun while I'm doing it.  The only part that really gets hard is being such a high volume store we will have a line of impatient people that goes out of the door.  But overall this place is a great place to work.
good,"Starbucks will forever be a jewel in my professional and personal life. I love the coffee. I love the culture, the staff, the management. I loved the benefits, and the healthcare. I only thing I would change would be the compensation. Most employees I worked with made about $8/hr. This is not competitive in the market considering the amount of knowledge and skill required to do this job."
good,"I learned great customer service skills, along with ability to juggle multiple tasks. Hardest part of the job are the hours. Very early and sometimes late depending the store. "
good,"A typical day at work consist of welcoming customers when they step through the door, giving them a genuine greeting and smile. We brew coffee and make espresso drinks with accuracy and speed. It's a team environment and everyone has a task to perform, but never forgetting about providing great customer service. Everyone learns about the coffee culture, where our beans are produced and how it is processed using different methods. Store managers and shift supervisors works closely together to plan ahead and organize how to achieve our stores targets and goals, then communicating with the rest of the team on how to accomplish them. Our barista's always have great time working with each other and always help each other out. The hardest part of the job is opening the store at 4:30am when most people are still sleeping. The most enjoyable part of the job is recognizing and celebrating each partners individuality. It's what makes Starbucks the most unique companies to be a part of."
good,"•	Giving excellent customer service and sales, greeting customer and take orders, prepare coffee orders, cleaning lobby, clean the establishment according to states and company regulations."
good,"A typical day would include cash handling, beverage prep and a lot of cleaning. I learned how to get along with a variety of people and to work as a team. I learned to train new employs and to uphold company standards. I gained customer service experience and how to preform under stressful situations. The management has been great in working with my school schedule, and I have loved getting to know my co-workers. The hardest part of this job is that it is a very fast pace work environment (which I like), and that it is customer service based.The most enjoyable part of this job is working as a team, and  touching peoples lives. I love the work environment of Starbucks"
good,"Place a very busy but very friendly both for the people working there and customers.Place where communing with clients and work with amaizing team.I like to solving problems , but also helping others..Workin in nice environment gives me alot of joy. The nicest time is then when a client appreciates your work and praises you for it.Team is always ready for any sytuaction. Very frendly, helpful.Customers are coming there not just for coffee but to talk sometimes with anyone. Is a good feeling to make someone day happy."
good,A typical day at starbucks is very energetic and fun interacting with the customers and employees.
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced enviroment. I love the fact that I am able to meet and speak with all types of people. There's always something to learn and never a dull moment. I love the fact that I play a huge part in a persons day; whether its getting there day started and ready for work or just a stop off on a family or friends day out. Working at Starbucks really helps you grow as a person believe it or not. I love making all the different bevarages and learning the holiday drinks and having a coffee tasting with another employee so I can be able to describe it to an inquiring customer. It's also easy to develop really close friendships within this workplace because you're not working with that many people, we're just a small team here to make our customers day a little smoother."
good,"Yes there was a lot if physical work, but could have all the coffee I wanted while working  ;)"
good,If you like to work in a very fast moving workplace then this is a great place to start.
good,"A typical day and work involves a lot of multitasking. I learned how to manage a store, from customer service to leading a team to success. I was able to grow in people skills and working under pressure. The hardest part of the job is meeting sale goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing satisfied customers enjoy a hand-crafted beverage that you prepared."
good,Getting to know the customers that you will see every morning was nice. Getting to know them more personal making them feel more welcome when coming by.
good,"-Keeping busy with lots of stuff to do, helps get through the day"
good,Awesome training and growth opportunities. No compensation for increase of sales. Great Marketing that keeps your store busy.
good,"You get benefits, good pay, and a sense of responsibility."
good,"You really get to know your product and even learn to take pride in what you do. There's a healthcare plan and you get a pound of coffee free each month, which is amazing. The morning shift is usually made up of very bitter workers who find something to hate about everything and will ruin your day if you let them, but if you manage to get a night shift, or even just to remain unjaded, this is a great place!"
good,"Working at Starbucks was always fun, challenging, and demanding. My coworkers were the best part, and the company always wanted their employees to feel fulfilled, satisfied, and happy at work."
good,"check prior days sales and labor adjust as needed . respond to any emails and complaints. check online applications set up interviews. check inventory(milk count, paper products, pastry mark outs and perishable goods) check prior days labor adjust as needed. Do the bank deposit  for prior days sales. check to make sure all cash handling policies have been followed. inspect the store for cleaniness issues (pasty case, condiment bar, trash cans, bathroom, front of house, esspreso bar, back of house, and lobby floor.) turn over safe from shift supervisor. check retail set up is set to company standards and face fronting. role play and coach all partners on the floor to ensure proper customer service expectations are being exceeded. "
good,At Starbucks we always have the most enjoyable customers. There is always something new to learn about someone and a drink that will go along with their personality. My co-workers and I always did the necessary for one another and everyone always had a blast. The hardest part of the job was creating an on the spot drink for a customer who had never visited a Starbucks and was also the most enjoyable.
good,Great training and team support. Managers will work with schedules and with you on the floor.
good,"Starbucks has flexible hours and great benefits. The job is what you make of it, if you go in with a bad attitude then you will have a bad day but if you have a great attitude then it is a wonderful place to work. My boss is a wonderful man and care about the people that work with him and does not treat anyone like they work for him. The hardest part of the job is ALWAYS maintaining a positive outlook. The customers are great if you treat them nice."
good,"Starbucks has a great family oriented culture amongst it's workers. I worked for this company for five years and they went above and beyond to provide for their partners. As with any company you can sometimes feel like you don't matter (but honestly it depends on location) but overall they really do care about their employees and the great stores are the ones that enjoy what they do. I was taught to harness my love of people and genuine interest in them to solve customer service disputes as well as tailor my offerings to each individual customer."
good,"I would come in at 4am, start prepping and filling the pastry case, brewing coffee getting drink bases mixed waiting on our first round of regular customers. I learned how to multi-task, and connect with customers ans my co-workers were easy to let along with. As long as we worked together we rocked with great teamship!. however, there were days where we were short-staffed and had to try and still rock it with only two people. what i loved most about  working at Sbux was it was my longest job, I am very proud of that. and that it was the most enjoyable work experience I had..up until 2013."
good,"Working for Starbucks as a Barista is a wonderful experience. Starbucks is a wonderful company because of its high customer service rate. As customers walk in we as Braista's make them feel welcomed and special, we keep little conversation to make them feel comfortable. when we ask for their names it helps us remember them for the next time they come in we can address them. Having good customer service requires to make customers want to come back making sure their experience was pleasant. We often have "" Regulars"" that come in to our store that loves us because of our friendliness, & thats the most beautiful part of working there."
good,"Starbucks was a great fit for me at the time, but I never felt secure in my position there and I was very interested in advancement. However, the management made the idea unsavory. The benefits were phenomenal."
good,"I've managed to work with young people, train many of them as well. I've developed my customer services skills and I gained an experience in sales and in catering-retail management."
good,"This was my favorite job I've ever had.  I loved making the coffee and getting to know each of the regular customers.  It wasn't easy and down right stressful at times, but it was worth it.  I learned self-control while working here.  People can be very particular about their coffee and when customers were being unreasonable it wasn't always easy to hold my tongue.  That is hands-down the hardest part, I think, of any job involving customer service.  However, the conversations I had with the other customers not only vastly out numbered the negative encounters, but also out shine them in my memories of working there.  My only real complaint was about the management.  One of the shift managers seemed to just have it out for me and was constantly on my case about insignificant things.  I was one of the better baristas there so it seemed her constant nagging was unwarranted.  The store manager played favorites and I was passed over for a promotion twice because of it.  After the first time it happened, I went to her and told her I wanted to do what ever it took to get the promotion I wanted.  She told me what I needed to do and told me I'd get the next one.  Needless to say, I didn't.  Everyone else was nice enough while we were at work, but didn't really interact with me outside of work."
good,"A typical day at work as a shift supervisor would be to help customers, maintain the store, manage the team at hand, and to handle the finances.  I have learned a lot about coffee, but more importantly, learning that a simple conversation could lift someone else's spirits no matter the situation.  I very much enjoy working for my current manager.  There is not much mobility in positions after becoming a shift supervisor, but this is only a temp job.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the job itself.  It is not a difficult job as long as you have good social skills, and then the job becomes very enjoyable as you meet new people both regulars and newcomers."
good,Starbucks made sure that partners knew that the work/life balance was important and provided tools to help partners ensure that.
good,"load/unload trucks, stock production lines and jockeyed trailers"
good,"I learned so much about coffee, finding value in coffee and people, and how to have fun while working. I would love to work for Starbucks again in the future."
good,This job taught me how to multitask at a very fast pace.  Loved making the drinks and decorating them to look like the pictures.
good,"A typical day at work tends to be very fast pasted. You spend 98% of your time on your feet. I learned more about customer relations and how to provide swift but effective service to anyone. Management is very concerned about your growth and moving forward as a team. Your co-workers will make sure that you are covered and assist you with anything you may not know, thus, teaching you every step of the way. The hardest part of the job would usually be being caught in a rush. It requires a lot of patience. The most enjoying part of this job are the people that you meet and the connections that are made. "
good,"As a store Manager your responsible for a staff of 15+ people.  Day to day activities include working on the floor managing staff and interacting with customers."
good,"I would usual manage the opening shift where a cor-wroker and myself would open the store. This included doing opening cash logs and register settings, printing out the daily schedule, and starting the ordering process. During the shift I would assign the daily cleaning tasks as well as assigning each partner scheduled for that day with their floor placement assignments (bar, cash, pastries..). I would then check up and make sure all tasks are being completed. I would also be in charge of the daily deposit. It was a very fun place to work. The hardest part of the job was making sure the other employees had their daily tasks done before leaving for the day. However, I came up with a sign off sheet to help myself, the other shift suprvisors, and my manager to keep track of the projects done and what needed to be done."
good,"I have valued my time at Starbucks and continue to do so. I have close relationships with my coworkers and customers. I run the shifts typically by deploying the baristas and giving them breaks, attending to any customer conflicts, ensuring that drinks are properly made, following all cash handling procedures, ensuring that the customers are feeling welcome, making sure that the store is maintained. "
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, great benefits and it's a pretty easy paycheck. It's lovely not having to go home thinking about your job. I loved most of my coworkers over the six years I worked for the company; every now and then you get someone that is unpleasant but for the most part I was friends with my coworkers. I miss the benefits: health insurance for part time employees, free coffee/tea markout every week, 30% off, free drinks while working, health incentive programs. If you have a good store manager you will be SET, otherwise you can usually transfer to a new store. I felt like it was fairly easy to move up in management too. You can work allover the United States with this company. I worked in over 13 stores allover the US and it was so nice to be able to have job security wherever I went. "
good,"We'd start by filling up the cake and pastry cases, revving up the coffee machines and making sure the café was clean before we opened up. It'd start off quite quiet, we'd have one person on the till and one making the drinks, and as we got busier through the day, we'd have more staff to cover breaks and keep the café clean and food replenished."
good,"great place to start building your resume and gain work experience. the environment is great  and the benefits are great also"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty busy, a lot of regulars coming in and chatting with the partners enjoying the atmosphere. I learned everything as to how to be a manager and how to be professional and conduct your self that way at work or even in my daily life. the people i work with was, it was a diverse group of people so we learned a lot from each other, i think one of the hardest parts of the job was having to let someone go due to low job performance, you work with a person give the opportunities to get themselves together but sometimes i just doesn't work and you as a manager have to make those decision. one of the most enjoyable is training and coaching a partner to take more of a supervisor role in the company you see the potential in some of the team members and when your able to get them to the next level its very rewarding for them and you."
good,This is a great first job!
good,This is a fast-paced and high volume store. A typical day includes running and maintaining a clean and healthy work space while promoting Starbucks community values. Each customer should feel warm and special when greeted and the employees excel in this.
good,A typical day of work begins being thrown into a busy busy morning serving customers. As the morning continues on and slows down there is time to connect with your other partners and team. Throughout the day we engage customers in new store promotions and make sure they will come back.
good,I feel that working in Starbucks has given me knowledge and skills that will last me a lifetime.
good,"My store on 32nd St, and Bell in Phoenix, Arizona was best described as family. My manager worked with my school schedules and was very flexible. The atmosphere was welcoming and always inviting. The most enjoyable part of my job was making connections and becoming friends with my regulars I had the pleasure of serving."
good,"Fantastic customers and regulars, and very satisfying to work the bar with accuracy and aplomb. A good manager saves the day and makes the store hum like a well-oiled machine. I learned more about dealing with people and staying on top of multiple tasks than I even thought I could. Wonderful co-workers you can depend on and learn from. However, there's always the bad customer to mess with your groove, and the work never really ends. One of the most demanding jobs I've ever held."
good,"A typical day at work would be setting up the store for business, helping customers and running breaks. In addition I would do the banking and money management. I would also set up promotional materials, approve and organize donations, track inventory and sales and complete merchandise orders. One difficult part of the job is the long hours that comes with working in retail management. The most enjoyable part is getting to meet new people and have every day be a little bit different."
good,"This Starbucks location is the highest grossing store in the company, which offered us a high volume environment. Developing effective listening and communication skills were critical, identifying customer needs, and how to capitalize those needs in conjunction with store goals was a must. Management is spread a little thin to handle a store supporting forty-some-odd people, but we still pulled through. My coworkers are fun and high energy, eager to do a great job. The hardest part of the job is the location, some thirty-five miles away. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the people I got to meet."
good,I learned how to deal with many types of people and situation. Teaching others to be patient and always keep a smile on no matter what was the best feeling to have. Making someone’s day can start with just a cup of Joe and a hello is an everyday motto for me.
good,"I was really happy working here. They have great values and teach you great personal skills like customer satisfaction and multitasking.They have even greater benefits, while being a part timer I was still able to have their company insurance and stocks!"
good,its a great place to work and i love meeting new people everyday and also seeing the regulars
good,"contato direto com cliente, disponibilidade da gerência com relação aos funcionários, ambiente bem estruturado."
good,I love seeing regulars every morning or afternoon and developing personal relationships with them. A typical day at works goes very fast because we are in a fast paced environment.
good,A typical day at work would be greeting customers and getting to know them. Making coffee and lattes.
good,"Daily tasks include, but are not limited to; Checking labor, analyzing and adjusting labor, placing daily orders, sku tracking, inventory and email, working directly on sales floor with partners and engaging with customers, building schedules, processing payroll, conference calls, ensuring the store meets health department guidelines."
good,"I originally started at Starbuck to faciliate my acting career, and go to auditions and such."
good,"I really enjoyed making the best quality drinks to give to the customers. You really get to know your regular customers and at the same time make new friends. The team at Starbucks is more than great to work with. The hardest part of the job is staying on your feet the whole day, but making drinks is always fun."
good,some of the best people i have ever worked with was with my time iat Starbucks. Its a fun and fast paced job and its very rewarding.
good,With good management it's not a bad place to work.
good,It a fast pace job or slow depending on what time you work at. I learn to remember several drinks and to make them in good enough time to not let the customer wait to long for there drinks.
good,"The minute you clock-in for work you start getting orders on what to do. The place is packed and there are a million things to do. I never knew that people took coffee so serious. The good thing about the job is that you always keep yourself busy. Time goes fast, you meet new people, you experience times of chaos and stress, and times of fun and laughter. This job has it all. None the less they take care of their employees and everyone that takes their job serious has a chance to move up in the company quickly."
good,"Working at Starbucks can get a little hectic at times but that's part of the fun. I've learned how to create and personalize all of my drinks just like most baristas tend to do after working here. I love this job because customers make us feel special, and if one is part of such a great team like myself it makes our job ten times better and more enjoyable!"
good,"I loved working here, i regret transferring locations when i moved; it ruined everything"
good,"Great work life balance. Must be willing to perform daily duties, cleaning, making drinks etc. Great company with advancement opportunities"
good,Usually extremely busy so speed and sense of urgency are paramount and it is perpetuated through the wonderful leadership of management
good,"I worked at a college campus so the group was close of age to me and everyone was pretty laid back. We took our job serious, but we also just took time to make sure we all got along like best friends. Very enjoyable experience, and the company itself was fun to work for."
good,"My coworkers are what made my job at Starbucks bearable. Our store is extremely high volume, and the work is surprisingly physically demanding. This job is not for the faint of heart, and if you're in it for the benefits, just know that every year they cut them just a little more. At this point, actually going to the emergency room would cost my my house, even with Starbucks benefits."
good,"Being a shift manager, my typical day at work included tracking store progress on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. Inspiring partners to reach their full potential ensuring that the goals of the store are met. A major part of my position is to ensure a safe and clean work environment. The Starbucks in Russellville is among the cleanest in the state!"
good,"Great place to work. Fast advancement opportunities. Enjoyed a huge growth spurt in the district. Worked with great people and in the most positive work place I have ever worked in. I learned that customers don't care how much you know until they know how much you care, a philosophy that I use to this day in what ever job I have."
good,"Working a typical day at Starbucks is very fun and busy. I know most customers by name and have friendships with them. I have to remember all drink recipes and modify the drinks to the costumers desires. I have to be fast and very clean as I make drinks. I have to restock things as they get low and date everything as I put something new out of the floor. As customers walk in the door I greet them and see if they need any help ordering. I make suggestions to help customers figure out what they are looking for or have any questions. If the customer wants a drink or just wants to buy coffee beans, I am more than happy to help customers find what they are looking for and make sure they are happy and satisfied."
good,"My day's at Pasque were some of my greats days. I've learned alot in regards to how a business is to be operated, in the sense of catering to customers needs, going about setting up displays to promote new and old products."
good,"The typical day would be supervising employees, and supporting your team on what they needed. Making drinking and assisting the customers is always a must. It is fast paced and you need to think on your feet quickly. The best part of this job are the relationships your build with people."
good,"The main duties of the job are to create beverages and provide quality customer service. But, beyond customer service we make personal connections with customers, becoming a positive part to their days, and having them return again and again. From working as a barista at Starbucks I have learned to work under pressure, work fast paced, multitask, work well alongside others, supporting co-workers needs, and anticipating customer needs. The hardest part of the job is being able to provide the right response to upset customers to ensure they leave the store in a pleasant mood. The most enjoyable part is fast pace and the opportunity to create friendships with those around you."
good,This was my first job ever and I wouldnt mind working for a long time. It is a great company that takes care of you and has great benefits such as a free pound of coffee every week. We got to keep food that was going to be thrown out due to being expired and we donated to homeless shelters everyday. We got great tips due to being a great store. My highest tip share I made in a week was ninety eight dollars in cash on the spot. My average was 50-65 dollars. We got free drinks and had a 30 percent discount card. I had awesome employees and made the work worth while.
good,"Starbucks gave me the opportunity to learn proper time management (eg. work and school) and the value of work. The harder I worked the more respect and authority I received. I enjoyed my co-workers as we were all around the same age and typically were all students so our lives were pretty similar. However, at times I found customers to be a bit difficult. I understood that they were what kept us open so I was always pleasant with customers, yet rudeness was something I found a bit draining."
good,My days at work are pleasurable. I enjoyed working at Starbucks. I learned that changes are good.
good,I get to work with a great energetic team. We interact with customers on a daily basis. Have fun and work at the same time
good,"Starbucks is a fast growing, high paced, community involved company that I feel good working for. The team is usually very easy to work with and most of them enjoy their job. They pride themselves in appreciating and providing for their employees and most of the time do a good job of it. Being a barista is not very challenging, and does not pay very well, but working for a company that contributes to the communities they are in makes your feel good about who you are working for. Its a nice part time job with little responsibility."
good,Starbucks was a great experience. It taught me excellent customer service skills and how to never let a customer leave unhappy. I learned how to multitask and how to keep things running smoothly throught my shifts.
good,- Lots of light physical work
good,This job was my life for almost 3 years and I built strong relationships with fellow employees as well as customers. I was promoted to a supervisor as well as learning coach after one year. I learned how to manage a team of people and gained excellent communication skills.
good,it was a fun learning experience and great people to work with
good,"Starbucks is a good place to learn new skills as far as management and resposibilities, great company to start out at."
good,"I was working at SAIT Starbucks Coffee as a part-time employee. my job duties was preparing beverages, providing responsive customer service, performing cashier function, processed cash and credit sales and balanced cash, and maintaining inventory and organizing stock. I had great co-workers and manager, they were willing to help each other in friendly and respect manner. While I was working at Starbucks, I found the most enjoyable part of the job was serving customers' needs and wants because I could learn more about understanding other people's thoughts."
good,"I've been with the company for about 8 years, and I will always tell people that you can never find a place that promotes team work, has a consistantly fun atmosphere, and a positive energy vibe within. This job also allowed me to travel within the company to further my experiences. This company also promotes growth within the company through constant learning and coaching, the company recognizes it's success via it's team of players, and I can say from my experience, not many similar jobs, or Companies today, can mirror the positve achievements this company has done for it's employees."
good,"A typical day at work consist of me coming in to open about 7am, approximately 20-30 customers an hour until about 10am. Around 10am the store becomes extremely busy. This is the time that communication and team work is the most essential. A person ability to get a job done quickly and correctly is put to the test, while still displaying an excellence in customer service. Overall it can become stressful at times, but my co-workers makes the whole experience much easier to bare. The most enjoyable part of the job is the many new people you meet everyday and some of the interesting conversations that happen with some of the customers. Many of the customers become regulars and recognize you outside the job which is also a good thing."
good,"I liked working there, but for me I couldn't seem much advancement for myself after college because of my degree choice (math)."
good,"With my particular store, the management needs some work. I wouldn't say this is the case with all Starbucks. If you are a barista or shift supervisor you do receive tips as well. This company is ever changing, do not get used to doing one thing one way. They are great at getting you involved in things like learning where the coffee comes from and how it gets to us."
good,"In my experience, for the amount of work a starbucks employee puts in, we as partners, are underpaid. I also feel that some stores need more work in the ""organization department."" that being said, Starbucks is a GREAT company to work for. They have an amazing value system, and give great benefits Ike healthcare and 401K, as well as perks Ike free whole bean coffee every week."
good,"Depends on the store but it can be a very busy job. One of the most stressful jobs I've had but one of the best places to work also. Starbucks is very strict about everything so if you don't like having to follow rules to a tee, this place is not for you. They stress quality and they mean it! Learned a lot there. Made many friends! Great benefits and family is first!"
good,"The company has simply taken a turn for profit above partners, lowering morale and support and adding responsibility. The burn out rate is getting high"
good,I got transferred to a different store after a year of being there to help with a new store opening but I enjoyed the environment at both stores. Great work with very flexible with hours
good,"Every day is different, that's why it was so important to understand what needed to be done each and every day. The crew are very kind people and the values of the company are very good."
good,I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The customers I dealt with were amazing and some even became friends after my time there. The store I was at had a bit of an issue with managers. We went through three managers in under a year.
good,"Flexible schedules. This is the perfect job for college students. Drinks are easy to make. Great benefits, option to opt into dental and vision insurance policies."
good,"A typical day for me would be a 5-8 hour shift. As soon as I come in I'm greeted by management, who offers me coffee to get the day started. My managers and coworkers all work together to create a friendly and positive work atmosphere. We value our customers and they value our attention to detail. The hardest part is when we get a really big rush of orders, but that is one of the most enjoyable parts as well. I love rising to the challenge every day."
good,Fantastic place to work depending on the management at your location. The pay is a bit low for the amount of stress-causing customers you have to deal with at times.
good,Loved the people and management that I worked under. Hated to leave but needed more hours and money. Hardest part of the job was the amount of customers at one time coming through.
good,"Empresa multinacional, com chances de crescer profissionalmente."
good,"Great company to work for, not perfect by any means but at least they try. Upper management sometimes gives questionable demands because they have no idea how stores actually run. Very flexible, relaxed environment, great benefits."
good,"Working at starbucks I made a lot of work friends that helped me a lot. The benefits are amazing! The pay is ok, definitely have to work more hours to be paid more but the tips during the week is nice."
good,"It was a great place to work, benefits are great. They were great with my schooling as I was going in for teaching and they accommodated very well. I also liked the fact that we received free coffee every week."
good,"Every employee i have worked with at Starbucks is always warm and welcoming. Even when days are tough and there are struggles with customers your coworkers and manger are always there for you to assist you with any questions, tough situations and overall work experience."
good,I felt like my manger could be a little bit more understanding. If you're a hard worker you should attempt to keep them in the company. I gotta do me.
good,"Starbucks can be fairly picky when screening initial candidates but once you have a chance to interview, try to be a bit more relaxed, for they're always very welcoming and joyful to meet and interview potential employees."
good,"I love working for Starbucks and really enjoy my job. I don’t really want a new job, but an having difficulty performing the duties of my job due to a lack of support from higher managers regarding facilities maintenance issues. My store is a new building and things have not worked properly from day 1."
good,Starbucks was a wonderful place to work at as your team worked closely together and not one person was left to do all the work. Management was flexible with requests for days off and if you were a part time student. The attitude of the workers is what made working days the best even if obstacles were thrown at you.
good,"Great for younger people, who are going to college, or looking to go to college, which they have for free.  Great health benefits and ease of hours.  Not great to build a long term job after college"
good,There were many learning opportunities in working in this community because they are a very supportive of community opportunities for the community and the community for Starbucks
good,"If you have a lot of patience for dealing with irritable people with caffeine addiction, then I'd say this is a pretty good job. The pay is decent, the benefits are very good, and it's easy to get hours. The 'borrowing' system makes this job nice, because if you don't get as many hours as you want, you can go help out at other stores who need to cover a shift. It's done on the website with your manager's approval (I never had a manager deny me borrowing at another location). I knew many Baristas who were only scheduled for 25 hours or so, but got themselves up to around 40 hours easily enough with this system. Overall it's a very fast paced job with a LOT of multi tasking. The day goes by very fast if you get a morning shift. The downside to this job, which is the reason I eventually left, is the same as any other service job - horrible customers. Maybe I got unlucky and worked at particularly bad locations, I don't know, but these were especially awful customers compared to other service jobs I've had."
good,Working at Starbucks was a great job to have while being a full time student. They had flexible hours and believed in having work-life balance.  I would recommend working at this company to anyone that needs a job part-time.
good,"Working as a barista at Starbucks was an overall very enjoyable experience for me, especially as a first real job ever. I felt included, supported, and I felt that I performed exceedingly well at my work tasks everyday."
good,"Hands down the best organization I have ever worked for. The people are excellent, the leadership is stellar, and the mission is alive and well. Starbucks is a great organization to learn from great leaders"
good,te enseñan a ser empatico con los clientes y te ayuda a trabajar en equipo
good,"There’s lots of diversity. Great benefits. You get to work with great people. Flexible hours. Managers can make or break it though. It’s a high stress environment depending on your location. The pay is not the greatest, we do wish we got payed a bit more for the work we do. Other than that it’s a great job for experience with customers and coworkers."
good,They give you good insurance and great benefits. They help you pay for online college course. You choose your own hours. You get a 41k and stock and pains vacation and sick time.
good,Coworkers are very nice and I enjoy working with the people I do. I love the environment there. You’ll have a blast!! You won’t regret working with the people you work with
good,"Fast paced and fun environment, free coffee and great local managers (at least in my experience). Starbucks is a great job while in school or if you are looking for long-term retail career options."
good,"Starbucks is a great company, with lots of benefits, opportunity to grow and move up fast. Managers will work with you and for you, should you need the help."
good,Starbucks is a really good company to work for. Time goes by fast due to the fact that Starbucks is usually always busy. You can definitely build your work ethic at Starbucks especially as a first job.
good,"The company was a great experience and they truly take care of their employees, but it was hard to maintain the swing shift I had to work on and daytime openings did not happen often."
good,This is a great place to learn how to be a team player and has a lot of diversity that allows you to express yourself while learning how to take care of customers and the business.
good,"Schedules are put out 3 weeks in advance, management is easy to talk to and it’s a fast pace learning experience. Tips are a great compensation as well"
good,"I always open, so I get there at about 5am, brew coffee, then set up the bar and rtd station. Days go a decent pace, but could be faster. Overall, a good job to have, they just keep you busy."
good,"I really enjoyed this job and the many benefits included, but the stereotypes of the stressful work atmosphere created by people who can't ""function"" without their coffee made for a not so pleasant environment all the time, sadly."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work with wether you’re looking for something as simple as 2 shifts per week, or looking to move up to a corporate position. There is a place for EVERYONE at Starbucks and they are ALWAYS HIRING!!!"
good,"This company felt like home as soon as I received the call that I was hired. Throughout my beginnings at the company I progressed very quickly  the best part about Starbucks at the time was the support of my fellow partners  we all worked to encourage each other and help each other in all aspects of life. We became a family, Throughout my first year we lost many reliable partners to college and moving. I became a barista trainer and had the ability to train many new incredible baristas  Being a barista trainer because hard as we received a new manager from an outside company  Becauze this occurred, the proper way to train went awry with the learning curve that came to working at Starbucks. Many of the things that originally brought me to apply to the company have changed. Originally, I was the sole worker of chalkboard signage for the store  Now, Starbucks is phasing our chalkboard signage in order for a clean and consistent look throughout its stores  Part of the reason I had applied to Starbucks was for the representation of individuality. With my two year anniversary at the store fast approaching, hours have been cut throughout my district, I am no longer making enough money. Overall, I love the company that hired me and became a second home for me."
good,I worked at 3 different locations and I liked the store managers at all of them but the atmosphere was a lot different for each. There are some store managers who you can come to and they will genuinely try to help and others that don't listen to their partners.
good,"at first the job was difficult because of all the memorization, however once getting the hang of things and building muscle memory it became easy."
good,"I only worked here for a short time. Overall, the place was super friendly. All employees were super nice and drama-free. The manager is very interpersonal and genuinely cares about how you are doing. Most of my issues were with hotel policies, which Starbucks had no control over. The work environment was always uplifting and encouraging. Most coworkers would go to the end of the earth to help you out. "
good,"Starbucks is a very friendly, happy welcoming place. They always have a smile on their face and they always engage in good conversation with the customers as they fix their drinks."
good,"Starbuck was a very fast-pace work environment. Management was awesome and my co-workers all worked as a team which I very much value. It was a great experience, with plenty of new lessons."
good,It's not an essay job for the body and your feet but it's fun and a great environment. Great for a first job. ........................................................
good,"I had a wonderful experience working for my specific Starbucks location due to an incredible manager and supportive team. The store was close to perfect even during the peak-hours of the day. I learned that management is too important when considering the overall morale of the store, cleanliness, and efficiency."
good,Stores that are overly staffed tend to give you much less hours than previously intended. For the amount of work given it is ironically understaffed due to bad scheduling from newer management  The turnover rate for employees is very high.
good,"A typical day of work consist of serving the customer with the utmost satisfactory beverage, or food, ordered by the client; at the same time make them feel welcomed as if it was their second home."
good,"Starbucks has excellent benefits, but I will admit it's not a job for everyone. Mostly understaffed from new partners quitting spur of the moment. Starbucks offers medical and dental, a program to earn a BA through ASU and sick time. There are always opportunities for those willing to move up."
good,"Starbucks is honestly quite underrated as an employer, flexible hours even as a supervisor and more often than not coworkers that keep you energized and ready to make it through the day. The company doesn’t offer management the best capabilities to support employees but they usually do what they can to support you. I worked at a busy drive thru and as a supervisor that put a lot of strain and stress on me. But cafe stores are a breeze!"
good,This is an overall wonderful company to be employed for. The managers have always given me what I need to be successful and to be my best self while working.
good,"Everyday was fun, even though we were always laughing and enjoying ourselves, we always got our job done and we always made sure our customers were taken care of first no matter what. I became a coffee master and learned about the origin of coffee and how the company started and stuff. We would have gatherings testing each other about the things we had learned and we had coffee tastings paired with foods the brought out the coffee notes. The customers were always so nice and friendly, I knew all the regulars and had their orders memorized, they always had a smile on their face. Over all my experience with the company was amazing!"
good,It was good overall  everyone is nice and respects you  they take good care of partners and value they’re thoughts and feelings  I just didn’t like that I don’t see much area to grow they don’t offer much experience
good,"Starbucks is a place where you come to enjoy peace and enjoy coffee with the people you love. What i learned from this is that people tend to not be polite and entitled about what they want and deserve. I miss working here because i enjoyed the people i worked with, it sucks not coming to the store everyday but its time to move on."
good,"Great place to work and great entry level work. I personally found it difficult because of the fast paced environment especially at busier times but I thoroughly enjoyed the staff, management, and environment. It has great potential for personal growth within the company."
good,"I was able to gain meaningful relationships on the job, with my team members but also members of the surrounding community. This helped me to gain necessary skills for the workplace. I was able to utilize my creative side by honing my craft, which was a very important part of the job to me."
good,You deal with customers and people nonstop throughout each shift. So it is imperative that your interpersonal skills and customer service skills are on point. The most enjoyable part of the job is probably just bonding and connecting with my employees and some of the regular customers that come in. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a high volume of orders with not enough employees working with you.
good,"Perfect job to have when balancing life and school. Amazing benefits, and company stock shares. Easy company to advance in, with a very welcoming atmosphere"
good,"Starbucks was a fun place to work, I had great co--workers and was able to build good relationships with customers! It was a fast pace environment so I was never bored and getting free coffee is a HUGE bonus (:"
good,learned to interact with customers more and its a lot more calm because the customers want to talk to you. The Drive thru aspect is very productive because they aim to get the drink within a certain amount of time to meet set goals.
good,THIS WAS 13 YEARS AGO.....in California.  I have worked there consistently and am now in Georgia.  I love Starbucks.  It is a very demanding job with constant customer interaction.  Starbucks is very different as a fast food environment because we customize everything.  You have to deal with dissatisfied customers and bring them around to be happy and feeling good about their experience.  This is the part of the job I love.
good,"Consistent and new customers"
good,Helped me through college by being flexible with school schedule. Great environment and awesome way to learn customer service skills. Great training process.
good,To work with Starbucks is really a very good experience. It helped me to boost my confidence and enhanced my capacity. I am satisfied working with Starbucks.
good,"Working at Starbucks can be difficult but is extremely satisfying. It can be intimidating thinking about learning all of the drink recipes and day-dotting procedures, but supportive partners, which are encouraged by Starbucks's workplace culture, make all the difference. Connecting with customers (both important and expected) may be difficult for someone more introverted, however I have found it great for working on coming out of my shell. Making someone's day/day better through a positive interaction (a genuine compliment, a free drink to help mitigate a bad day, a free cakepop given for a child's birthday) is the best, most rewarding part of working at Starbucks."
good,"It can be and easy and stressful job at times but the goal is to make people feel welcomed and make their drinks right. At times it can be Super positive and very helpful. Very flexible hours Manager respects partners  availability. There is just a lack of positive, motivation  and encouraging words on a daily bases."
good,"Most days you know what to expect when you come into work , the routine doesn't change too often, what changes are the customers attitudes and the atmosphere as the days go on. I learned a lot about how you should be treated as an employee compared to how I was being treated at my last job, which was poorly, for about 7 years. The hardest part about this job for me was learning to be confident in the plays the company has in place for me to make placement decisions for my team (and forcing myself to partake in small talk while making or waiting to serve coffee- I am terrible at it). I am a general manager at heart, I enjoy the managers here they're awesome and do an amazing job."
good,"Even though the workload is not very equal to what we're getting paid I enjoyed every shift because of the other partners, so overall i think working at starbucks is a good place to start tour career"
good,I really had a great manager and team here in my location. The store can be very busy at some hours but the job itself is not as difficult and stressful compare to other cafes and restaurants.
good,Would recommend it a friend. It taught me a a lot about customer service and dealing with stressful problems at the job while remaining humble and proactive
good,"Its nice working the, there are a lot of people who are rude, but over all of my partners are super awesome. I can't speak for all store, but this one rocks!!"
good,"Treat their employees very well"
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. They give a lot of support and provide multiple growth opportunities.  You build a strong relationship wit your partners and customers!
good,"Its a great learning experience working at Starbucks, its very team work focused while encouraging self-progress and personal value. Does encourage leadership skill and coffee culture knowledge. Includes barista skills, food serving skills and cashier skills, and mobile/uber eats. You learn how to work in a fast paced environment in high volume situations depending on the store location. In the locations i have previous worked at had a lot of management problems and disorganization that it put a damper on the stores customer connections, and is a main reason  why i have resigned."
good,My experience there was fun and the co workers I had were very understanding and helping with teaching all of the drinks you have to make. It got a little intense at lunch rush but when you got into the habit of things its fun. Great place of work.
good,"I worked here part time and it was great! Training was rough, but the work culture and overall caring nature of the company is fantastic. I made great friends working here and had some good times."
good,Overall great company to work for. Willing to work around schedules. Staff was overall friendly and fun to work with. Also the environment of the store was a positive one.
good,I loved working at starbucks everyone was so nice to me. the enviroment was warm and cozy. I met my 2 best friends who i still talk to today while working there. my favorite part about working at starbusk was being able to brighten peoples day by just one cup of coffee.
good,"Honestly Starbucks is a fantastic company to work for, They pay 11+ an hour for just making coffee, You get health insurance, stock, free coffee every week, paid vacation, 401K, Matched vacation pay, Free spotify premium, Free food every shift, free drinks every shift as well as a 30% discount off everything, 4 free years of college online through ASU and the list goes on and on!! There is also an annual raise which is only typically 20-30 cents but that's still much more than any other food and bev job. It is a HIGHLY stressful environment, Like way more stressful than you would ever think possible. The biggest downfall off Starbucks is you can either end up at a really good or a REALLY bad store, some teams are awesome,some are horrible. Some managers are awesome and some are horrible. Some stores are high volume and some are low volume. So, You don't really know what you're getting yourself into. The hours are also usually not so great unless you are a shift leader 9 out of 10 you're going to get less than 30 hours easily."
good,Working at Starbucks was an amazing experience. I learned to make drinks. I got to meet different types of people through customer service and my co workers. Anywhere we work in life is a life skill we gain.
good,It's a pretty easy job with the right team. There are times where rush hour can completely crowd the store inside and drive through but with focus it is manageable. You will get to bond with your crew and the other ppl there that slowly turns it's staff into a family
good,"I am a shift supervisor and I work at a flagship store.  This means we are very busy and are in the market for test items within the company.  The culture at Starbucks is very positive and it fosters not only company growth, but personal growth as well.  I have learned a lot working here and Starbucks has made it easy to stick around with the many benefits they offer.  Starbucks is a great place to work."
good,My store specifically is very fast pace but not every store is like that depending on its location. I’ve had good experience with my coworkers due to being a big team player. You have to be able to communicate with your coworkers here. And the benefits are great for my first time getting it on my own
good,"It was probably the best place I've worked at so far. I worked in a mall, so it was very fast paced. However, the vibe and friendliness of all my coworkers really made it better. Management also try to match with your requirements. It was overly a very good and standardized learning experience in terms of working in fast paced environment while learning good customer service."
good,"Great job for anyone who needs a part time job while in between places in life. Started when I graduated college and it's a godsend. A bit challenging to memorize the drinks and working on bar while you're still fresh on the job is kind of a nightmare. Once you finish training and get used to it (took me about a month), the atmosphere and benefits outweigh the negatives. You get unlimited free food and drinks 30 minutes before and after your shift, and during your shift."
good,Overall a great company. If you don't want to be a store manager the highest up in the company you can go is shift supervisor (unless you do cooperate) I've had a lot of issues with management in my stores I've found most of them are lazy and don't work on the floor often to help out. Some of them don't even really know how to make all the drinks. And they get weird rewards like trips for big conferences with all the other managers. That's money Starbucks could be putting into their employees but oh well. They just have their priorities a little off.
good,"Although Having routines and company policies to follow, every day working at Starbucks is different with new challenges and opportunities coming to light on every shift. The fast-paced nature of the job means that teamwork and communication skills are easily developed and mastered ready to be transferred into any future roles or progressions out-with or within the company."
good,It's not a bad place to work and opportunities for advancement exist but are eventually smaller and smaller. Starbucks is a company that many people love and in my time alone I have met more people than I can count on both hands whose absolute goal is to work their way up in the company.  Competition is stiff. Be able to deal with customers as you will do this day-in and day-out. Learning to make drinks and remembering everything seems to be the hard part at first but consistently making the experience a good one for customers is the hard part.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks when all the employees showed up to work, I still managed but it would be hard only working with three people in the store with a line out of the building"
good,Great team work and we always celebrate the little and big victories. Always focusing our work on served the best qualify hand craft beverages while keeping a high customer connection.
good,"I worked three years at starbucks. I worked at a fast past cafe and drive. Starbucks was both constant and ever changing I learned alot about craft and coffee and how to work well with co workers, management, and customers."
good,"You will have to deal with the usual issues that come with working a food service job, but all the employees I've worked with made the job fun and there are great benefits available such as free food and drinks, discounts on merchandise, a free pound of coffee each week, 401k, as well as medical and dental. The hours are flexible and the job is varied so the day goes by fast. You will work hard, there is always something to do, but for the compensation it is a pleasant place to work."
good,"Working here was more than just going to a job. It was a place to socialize with the customers, to make friendships, and develop life long skills."
good,"I love working at Starbucks, more so than my first job. I really enjoy the fast-pace because it keeps me on my feet and I specifically find making all of the different beverages exciting. I get to perfect my craft. If everyone (emphasis on everyone) works together to keep the store clean, flowing, and successful then you will enjoy it! When there are slackers, I promise you it shows! "
good,If you enjoy a fast paced environment that involves food and beverage this is the place for you. Multitasking and time management play huge roles in a place like this as well
good,"Hay una buena cultura organizacional. El sueldo también es bueno, como part time es tranquilo pero cuando eres full time es más fácil sentirse cansado."
good,A typical day at Starbucks was productive and fun. I learned good organization skills and multi-tasking. Management was fantastic and personal. The work place culture was personal and positive. The hardest part about working at Starbucks was the intensive cleaning. I enjoyed working with customers/employees. Overall I had a good experience at Starbucks
good,"During my time at Starbucks, I fell in love with the company as well as the job. I loved hand crafting beverages to each customers liking. I spent a lot of time making drinks, time on the cash register, as well as time spent cleaning. Starbucks has a standard that needs to be met every day in order to provide quality service to its customers. Starbucks is a great company to work for. The reason I left was because of poor management above me. There is plenty of room for development within the company, but it seems that store managers hold you back for their own personal gain, and take the credit for all of the hard work that you put in."
good,"I  worked at Starbucks for 11 years in multiple states. At Starbucks I would manage the floor and people working it, scheduling, money and inventory management. Being organized is crucial in a fast paced environment and being able to adapt to what each day brings."
good,"Really great work environment and management. A bit stressful at first to learn all the drinks they make, however once you got that all figured out, really easy to prepare. I started off as a barista and was able to move up within the company as a Shift Lead (shift supervisor). Really great benefits; dental, vision, medical."
good,"- stressful environment during peak"
good,"Working at Starbucks was great, and I loved seeing and getting to know the regulars daily. Would give it a 5 but the adults there, especially the shift leads and the manager were some of the most childish and petty people I have ever worked with."
good,High volume cafe only sitting with huge focus on customer connections and relationships. Management was efficient and in control. Workplace culture was upbeat and fun. Hardest part of the job was leaving the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was having amazing customer relations and being the 2nd most profitable Starbucks in town.
good,Starbucks is a good job for someone who is in school. They are very flexible and understanding. Good benefits and fast paced as well as work with good people.
good,the most successful barista is willing to work hard and should have a general sense that people are good in the world. They should be able to leave work at the door otherwise they will be severely stressed out.
good,"A typical day at starbucks includes seeing the same customers daily. As well as those occasional ""rude customer"". However, the benefits and co-workers made everything manageable."
good,Working for Starbucks has allowed me to gain great customer service skills as well as being a productive member of a team. I am responsible to count and distribute cash tips. Crafting beverages as well as food handling. Customer service is essential to this position.
good,"Working here is great, however, customers are ruthless and you are expected to remain calm no mater how rude or disrespectful they are towards you or your coworkers."
good,"Good job, friendly staff. Good opportunity to grow up and get new skills."
good,Working at starbucks is one of those fun jobs that can be super overwhelming if you have even one call off. There are so many people put on the schedule for each position on the floor; it just makes everything run smoother. We had a lot of regular customers so getting their order done in a timely manner was super easy. Drive thru was the most fun because of the extra interaction and it was the most work so it always kept you busy
good,"At Starbucks you can reach your highest career aspirations with continued support, coaching and development from leaders at all levels. Starbucks creates a culture of excellence and develops the very best leaders in retail."
good,I worked at my location for 2 years and my crew ended up being a family. I love visiting because they make me feel really awesome that I know them. Awesome place to build relationships with your customers.
good,"Es una gran empresa preocupada por su personal, tienes muy buenas prestaciones."
good,"I was a barista for 2 years. Friendly customers, coworkers and great benefits make it an excellent place to work. Working here will enhance social skills, multitasking abilities and time management. The hardest part of the job was the fast paced environment and difficult customers."
good,"Overall I really did enjoy my time working at Starbucks. The work environment was fun and enjoyable but also very inclusive and caring about all the workers. I loved all the people I worked with and am glad I did. The only complaint I could give was once I went back to school and requested for a lighter work schedule i was promised by my employer that they would do just that and lower my hours to whatever I could handle. Unfortunately this promise was not upheld and after reminding them multiple times and being informed it would happen eventually, I had to quit as I could not maintain my school and work lives at the same time. I was sad to leave but was upset that promises were being made and not upheld so it's what I had to do."
good,"Starbucks is a welcoming environment and happy to work there. The job is mostly fast pace and demanding, especially on weekends and mornings. Starbucks has many great benefits for employees."
good,"Barista                                                                                                September 2018 – June 2019"
good,"I worked for starbucks for many years because its the type of company that takes care of you and makes it so hard to leave. They were so accommodating and flexible to work around my schedule. It was nice to have a work place that I could go to as an outlet to help manage the stress from school. My only negative experience was the physicality of the job. I worked at a drive through store where the demand was high and the lines never stopped. I was fast on bar and my boss would push me constantly to ""pump out the coffee"". For me it started to feel like making coffee was a sport instead of the old coffee shop feel and culture i so love."
good,If you are in college or planning on going to college while working. Starbucks is a great company to be apart of...They assist you with school and work around your school schedule
good,"All and all, Starbucks was a great company but the management could’ve done more to help it be a better company. Not only for the customers but also the employees."
good,Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. The company stands for something and it really cares about its employees and customers. Everyday is about making the experience great for everyone.
good,Overall a decent experience where I met a lot of awesome people and had ample opportunity for advancement. Just looking for something different at this point in my life.
good,"Starbucks is a well organized company, very social and Cultural, It is Very quick-paced and On track and Strict with certain rules, But overall the difficulty it’s worth The experiences and friends you make 💕"
good,"I had a great and consistent team for about one year from the manager to the newest person. They were some amazing people, and I met my mentor, who is now like an older brother to me. Even after joining the military I am still friends with a handful of my coworkers, and have seen some have families, go off to college, graduate, and go onto bigger and better jobs. "
good,Loved working at my location. Friendly coworkers and regulars at the store kept the days good fun and enjoyable. Only problem I had was that there are never performance raises.
good,Deberían siempre verificar a quien se asciende ya que puede jala en cadena a toda una tienda
good,"Overall, I still use plenty of skills Starbucks instilled in me as a partner. I would be happy to return to as a partner, however, the pay in Orlando is still too low. Benefits and advancement and training are impeccable. Sadly though, in order to survive the cost of living in Orlando, I'd have to have two jobs in order to support myself. Which I what I'm trying to get out of. I always recommend someone to work at Starbucks at some point. It's opened many doors for me."
good,Great place to work if you are in school. They are willing to work around your schedule if you are upfront about what you can work. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"training baristas and supervisors"
good,"Starbucks was one of the toughest jobs I had because I was always working a busy morning shift, and everything was fast paced. It was the same routine every morning, but I quickly learned how to work under a stressful environment in a timely, efficient manner. I was lucky enough to have a heart warming manager who always looked out for her staff. She was the reason why I loved working at Starbucks because she made it feel like home. When I first started, I relocated to a brand new Starbucks that was opening up, so working there at first took a while to adjust, but I felt as if that was the reason why the work culture there was such an amazing experience. We al worked together as a team to build the new place up. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the friends I was able to make with my coworkers and the customers. The hardest part about working at Starbucks was trying keep the place clean."
good,The company does a great job fulfilling its mission statements and demonstrating its business/workplace values. They have a lot of great benefits but their wages could be a little better.
good,In my personal opinion Starbucks life just isn't for me. It didn't fit how I lived. I know some people make a life long career out of it but I wasn't trying to go that route. It's still a good job overall.
good,"Being a barista on a typical day is all about customer connection and providing the best service. The environment is fast paced, skill oriented, and very fun."
good,"productive and fun, interacting with customers, friendly environment. knowledge and enjoyable workplace.                                                        ."
good,"My manager/store overall was very positive and inclusive. I had a good time working there and made long lasting relationships. Overall the job itself is easy, the only bad thing is the customers are rude (like at any customer service based job) and my store was extremely busy and stressful. You must be able to multitask and work under pressure. I feel like if I had a different manager that was not as good as the one I had at the time I probably would have left sooner because the pay is very low for the amount of work and running around you do."
good,"Great benefits and work culture for a part time or temporary role. Unfortunately the pay is not high enough in comparison to living expenses in this are, and not all stores can offer full time."
good,I loved working for Starbucks. Work was fun and the people were great as well as some customers. The overall experience was great and I appreciate the how much management cared for the employees.
good,"Working at Starbucks can be challenging. There are a lot of beverages to learn but once you understand the process, it is a fairly simple job. Great Benefits. They have a program to pay for your college education (100% tuition reimbursement). This job can be physically strenuous, there is constant motion involved. This is an environment where positive and hard working people really thrive. I simply wish they offered better pay."
good,"Starbucks has to be one of the best companies i have ever worked for, the staff, benefits, customers, training is all very well done, the relationships you build with your employees and customers is the best feeling. I would recommended anyone to work for Starbucks no matter which location."
good,"Number one aspect that made working at Starbucks enjoyable was the managers were always willing to work with everyone's individual scheduling needs, even if they changed throughout the year."
good,Had a good work culture overall. Great coworkers and customers. It could get stressful at times depending on how busy the store got. I enjoyed making drinks and meeting people throughout the day and to have meaningful conversations.
good,"Working in a crowded Starbucks was stressful at times but I got to meet some amazing people. From the baristas who trained me to regulars, they all made the cafe a special place."
good,Working at Starbucks is a great job for any new graduate or student. I’ve met some of my lifetime friends here and also made advancements in the company! Definitely recommend being a partner!
good,I was able to work in a very efficient team and make lots of friends! The management was mediocre due to the fact that various managers came and left!
good,Starbucks is a great place to work like customer service and partner oriented company. Starbucks provide all types of benifit to the partner and customer comes first for it. It says customer is always right makes them happy. Thanks
good,"Everyone is fun. We try to make our customers feel the same. Everyone is trained with the option to fill any role, however, some are more suited for specific roles."
good,The people I got to work with made the job so much better. Typical day is be on the register then go on bar and make drinks. Learned to communicate efficiently and multi-task.
good,"it’s hard to receive the consistent hours you want. some weeks you get a lot ; or enough really. and others you get hardly any and may have to drive around to work at other stores to pick up enough to live off of, it can be frustrating."
good,Great! I loved working here because starbucks provided a really good pay from where I used to live and gave a lot of opportunities to grow with the company and create a bond with others.
good,A great first job for anyone.This was my first job and I left due to becoming pregnant and choosing to become a full time mom. You learn about quality and how to utalize yourself in more ways then you knew.
good,Starbucks can vary depending on location and whether or not that location has a drive-thru or is just a cafe. My manager was very involved and communicated well to all partners (employees). Everyone was generally amicable and willing to help you learn.
good,"Starbucks is great in terms of compensation, benefits, and the fact that the environment welcomes everyone of all backgrounds. The only problem I had while working there was very often people who are undeserving are placed in management positions that they are unprepared for. Leaving them to basically have their hourly store supervisors run their store until they are replaced with someone better."
good,"Great place to work, keeps you busy."
good,"A typical day at work consists of communicating and interacting with each other and costumers, while preparing drinks and food that were ordered, all the while also making sure breaks and cleaning/organization tasks are completed in between. It has it's stressful moments when it gets busy, it can get pretty hectic, but that is also one of the best parts because it forces us to work together as a team and that inadvertently creates a positive camaraderie within the workplace, and another one of the great parts is the connection you make with the customers. More than 80% of the time, they are so appreciative of you."
good,"J'ai adoré mon expérience Starbucks, je me suis fait limite une petite famille, c'était super enrichissant."
good,Working at such a busy store highly challenges your skills in multi tasking and customer service. You learn the ins and outs of the store in many ways. Learning to make all the drinks can be challenging but the comerodery with your coworkers makes learning more fun.
good,"Starbucks is a lovely environment to work at with many benefits and very understanding management. "
good,"Starbucks is a very chill environment when it's not super busy, which means you can pretty easily foster good connections with your co-workers. Have had a great time working there."
good,"This was an easy, food job.  You showed up to work, did the same thing as the day before, and left at the end of your shift.  It was an easy routine which worked well around me having another job."
good,"Loved working here the team really is a family and managers really do put you first, great place to work "
good,"lots of room for professional growth, warm and welcoming environment, excellent and responsive management. Excellent and adequate training. always felt safe and included. cumulative vacation time is nice. major con is inadequate hours"
good,"I love that they embrace those of different backgrounds, they are not strict about hair styles just no visible piercings like nose or lip. The attire is very casual you can dress comfortable which you should since it gets pretty busy. I love the fast paced environment, it really helps when people know their job and what tasks they need to execute! It did get rough at times running out of items like cups, straws, coffee filters etc but other stores were willing to share. The people there are very hard working they strive to do their best to make sure customers leave satisfied!"
good,I worked as a temp during the holiday period so it was quite busy and I was always on the go. In my three months however I never got shown how to work the till which was a shame since I could have used that skill for future jobs. The staff were friendly and professional and my manager was also very sweet. The hardest part is probably keeping up with the pace but as I said I worked in the busy holiday period.
good,There are some things about the job that were tough but if you enjoy a fast paced environment you will never be bored. They do treat their employees well and it's clear in the benefits you receive after 6 months of working. Easy to advance if you are committed and good at your job
good,Starbucks always seems to hire great people who come to work to have fun while getting their work done. It's great for both students looking for flexibility around school or another job but it's also great for people with a passion for coffee who want to grow with the company.
good,"Loved working with Starbucks.   Had a  little too much coffee during my time there, but the atmosphere and perks from the company are much better than most companies.   would love to return to starbucks at some point in my career."
good,"Really enjoy working with a diverse group of people, from different states and backgrounds. No day is the same, but everyone is a team player! We are always willing to help each other out."
good,"Overall, my experience working as a Barista at Starbucks was very good and fast- paced. Working there helped me build a great sense of confidence when it comes to my communication skills. Management was very great and organized for the most part. Working there was very diverse and accepting of any race, sexual orientation and gender. The hardest part of working at Starbucks were the rush during the morning sometimes. We had a drive- thru so it was a little overwhelming due to the fact that I was always put there. The most enjoyable part was meeting a lot of new faces and making friends. Also the daily mark outs that we had."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working at Starbucks for the five years I was there. I worked at 3 stores during that period and I enjoyed my coworkers in every single one. All stores kept a tight knit relationship and made work fun. Out of 6 managers that I had, only one gave me any real issues, which mostly came from bad communication styles and favoritism. Another issue I had was I noticed there was incentive to over-hire so that there would be less Baristas getting sufficient hours/benefits.  Other than that, it's a good work environment, and a good place to build foundational skills and traits you'd use in other jobs."
good,"Great for first jobs and for long term career too."
good,"While my time as an employee at Starbucks was short. I enjoyed having the experience of being employed there. I love the Starbucks brand and coffee, so I was definite at a place that I wanted to be."
good,"J'ai eue une très bonne expérience en vente au sein de l'équipe starbucks, l’environnement de travail est agréable, l'échange avec les clients est plaisant."
good,"Starbucks treated me very well as a employee and partner, I only left to move on to another career.  They provide amazing benefits and atmosphere as well as promotion and opportunities for raises."
good,Customer service oriented job was excellent in this kind of work. Management staff was very considerate and reliable especially on your shifting schedules. Very recommended !
good,"Personally, Starbuck is fun socially and physically. It is a fast pace environment surrounded by special people that are hired. They emphasize teamwork and are always putting the customers first."
good,"Very early shifts starting at 4:30AM, fun and close team to work with. Lots of friendly customers. Downtown Vancouver is hard to work in, got approached with a needle twice."
good,"Starbucks is a big company, so if you want to grown and learn from it may take too much time. Thats I did not stay too much time at this job, at least for me I need something else."
good,"The work place was always very busy and there was never a dull moment, but the store was always full of energy and the people were great. The employees created a great support base for each other to make the store well running and enjoyable to work."
good,"If you love people, making coffee and are passionate about what you do its amazing.  The focus needs to be on your customers and partners not political stances. I really enjoyed being able to train and mentor my crew and watch them grow into string, reliable hardworking employees."
good,"Very quickly paced, I really enjoyed my time with Starbucks, and I learned a lot through working there. I became Starbucks certified which has helped me get further barista jobs in the future."
good,I love working at Starbucks and my store manager does an amazing job. My only reason for seeking a second job is to keep up with the cost of living in California.
good,"At Starbucks, you learn valuable information relating to customer interaction, multi-tasking, and complaints. It’s a safe, welcoming environment with opportunities to move up if you care for the store and your team."
good,"A typical day for me working at Starbucks is a constant fast pace work environment which I love. Connecting with customers, making the moment right, plus a great relationship you build with the ""regulars"". Making sure you have the baristas in the correct position to help make the shift run smoother. Defiantly knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your teammates help a lot. One of the may perks of Starbucks is getting free drinks during your shift and a food item. A huge bonus would be getting a pound of coffee beans each week  and weekly tips."
good,"Typically I work open shift during peak hours. It's always steady at least, or extremely busy. I learned so many things about coffee and tea, and constructing various Starbucks drinks. The workplace culture is a healthy one where teammates look out for one another. I love each and every one of my coworkers and appreciate the support they provide. The hardest part of this job is memorizing all the drink builds, but that come easily enough with time. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with customers and having an opportunity to better their day."
good,"Starbucks culture is absolutely amazing. Company cares about it’s impact on the world and employees. Plenty of perks, discounts and stock options. Unless you’re part of the small group that is able to make this job a career (shift manager, store manger etc) then the hours available make it nearly impossible to live off of without help from others. I would definitely recommend this job as a first job, or for those going to school. It was so much fun&I would go back if I were able to support a family with the wages."
good,"very friendly team mates, relaxed and fun environment, open-minded and understanding management, good work-life balance, flexible hours, frequent training and feedback on performance."
good,"I had a lot of fun working as a barista. It was just a side job but I met a lot of cool people and learned a lot about coffee and business. The hours were flexible and the manager was possible the best, most caring manager I've ever had."
good,"Clients can be sometimes aggressive, but other then that, i would recommend it to anyone, either in school, university, a parent (the hours are so flexible for you to spend time with your kids)"
good,"I really liked working here but the pay simply was too low. I believe I made $8/hr + tips, which wasn't enough for how stressful and exhausting the job could be."
good,"cool people, groovy job and excellent benefits.i love coffee and tea and scones and muffins and cake pops and cheese danishes and croissants and egg bites"
good,"It’s a really good student job. Flexible hours lots of free coffee. It’s fast paced and standards are often changing, so it keeps things interesting. I’ve gotten multiple friends jobs since it’s a fun time."
good,"It is a great place to work, with even better people to work with. The job is challenging but everyone comes together to help each other out. I enjoyed my time there."
good,Géniale pour une première expérience professionnelle !
good,"Everyone is awesome "
good,I knew that store was going to be my home store the moment I stepped foot in the door. The same baristas who watched me get hired were not the same ones who watched me leave. Working at Starbucks in general is a stressful job in itself. All you have is your co-workers and the free drinks.
good,"This is a great job to acquire benefits from. However, it cannot pay any major bills. It works amazing if you have a partner who brings home the larger paycheck and you utilize the benefits from Starbucks for you and your partner. They provide 401k and stocks even for part-timers which is unheard of."
good,"Great part-time job to have while completing my degree. My managers were always willing to work around my availability with my classes and almost always gave my requested time-off as long as it was given with enough notice. Could be stressful at times due to my store being very high-volume, but overall very fun with a great team."
good,"The job itself is great and does come with a great team of people and opportunities to advance from barista to upper management but the actual managers are a joke. The lack of coverage when someone is sick or needs time off for family emergencies is also a joke. They do not care if it's against the law for you to work when you're throwing up, they will force you to come in anyway and no one will cover for you. There were several incidents where we felt threatened by customers and other employees and when brought to management we were told to get over it while the managers hid in back avoiding whatever the issue was. Overall, the team building part is awesome and you will build relationships with customers and staff but the ethics are just not there."
good,"You will meet the best co-workers ever. I have worked at 3 different starbucks locations and have loved all my co-workers. The environment can be chill and laid back, then instantly change to fast paced and stressful. There are ups and down to the barista position, its has been stressful for me, but has had way more good days than bad. I love being a barista, it is one of the best skills you can ever have. A lot of multi tasking, and you are able to adapt to such a fast paced environment."
good,"Me gustaba mucho. Cuando trabajé allí, estaba estudiando. No había ninguna problema."
good,"I have been working with Starbucks for approximately 3 years - going on 4 this fall. It has been nothing but amazing! They are such a fun company to work for. The management is great, fellow partners are always kind and friendly. I think it's amazing that you can work part-time and still get benefits. Such good training as well! I have nothing but good things to say about working for Starbucks."
good,"Enjoyed working there and learning to make different drinks."
good,It’s aw awesome jobs good place to work. It was a really environmentally.Make new friends. Good pay.Good benefits.                                                             Meet new people
good,"A typical day at work consists of 8 hours of customer service and multi-tasking. I have learned a lot of patience and have worked extremely hard on my customer communication skills as well as developed stronger team bonds. I am currently in a managerial position as a shift supervisor. The hardest part of my job is juggling my daily tasks while trying to run the store and keep customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of my job is my partners/team, if it weren't for them we would not succeed."
good,"Really enjoyed my time at Starbucks meet great friends and never hated going into work, very often i looked forward to it. Towards the end the management began to slack but still enjoyed work very much."
good,"the wages are good and I work the same shifts every week, but not every Starbucks is like this. Can be hard to remember all the drinks but once you have it down you wont forget them. Overall good workplace and nice employees."
good,I have to many companys but this is the best one. They have the best management. And they are capable of improving your talent from Barista to management.
good,"A great company to start your workplace experience, and gain customer service experience as well. A lot of time on your feet, and sometimes dealing with tough customers."
good,Starbucks was a really fun place to work but it's luck of the draw on a good manager and they don't pay that great. Hours are usually pretty good and benefits are amazing!
good,Starbucks has great benefits. It’s a fun environment. It can get pretty busy at times. Not a job for a person who just wants to stand around. You make your schedule how you want it.
good,"I've had a lot of ups and downs with this job I've been a Barista, Supervisor and a Store Manager. I worked at licensed stores answering corporate stores.  Ive worked at over a dozen stores. This company varies a lot and each store is like it's own little world. The atmosphere, energy and interactions with employees and customers are all very different from place to place. Stay in the company, find a little world that you like and then make it work for you. My fianace and i  met here and we both have discovered that working 20 hour shift or less a week will allow you to love the job and feel valued and still get benefits if you need them. You want a raise? Ask. It's not always for sure but who knows. You want a promotion? Ask. This ain't a bad place. But unless you have it made in life and are just passing the time make sure your desicated dedicated to finding a new career."
good,One of the most rewarding companies that I have worked for. Starbucks is a company that truly values their employees and listens to our wants and needs.
good,Good company to work for. Employee discount and insurance are great to have. Lots of room to grow with the company and they like to promote from within.
good,"I really liked working at Starbucks, but it didn't take too long before I got the hang of the job. That said, each day pretty much bled into the next. I did really like my coworkers though, but always wanted to pursue something more challenging in coffee during my time there."
good,A great job to have if you are looking for a collaborative and exciting work experience. Must be able to adapt and move quickly. It can be a very demanding job but they are flexible and willing to customize your experience as a partner.
good,"Loved my team and my manager. Customers were hard to deal with, people can be mean! If you have a strong personality and mean comments don't get to you, then this place would be a perfect fit!"
good,Starbucks was a great place to work at never just stand around and do nothing always looking for something to do. The only bad thing about it was managers.
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, I would love to go back if I could! Unfortunately, it just doesn't pay enough to make a good living.  I wish the hourly rate for baristas was higher, because living off tips all depends on which store you're working at. But besides that, I would go back in a heart beat."
good,i learned a lot while working here.gave me the skills to become a really good manager.and learned how to work as a team very very well and how to communicate better with others and guest overall.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. It is fast paced and the time goes by super quick which I personally love. The job requires lots to learn but once you get it down its pretty simple and straight forward. I loved all my coworkers and management. The only thing to complain is it doesn't pay well. However, they offer insurance and paid college to part time and full time employees which you don't really see anywhere else. Overall I would recommend as a part time job but most people could not survive on the salary only here."
good,"To start, I worked as a shift supervisor in a store. My manager was absolutely fantastic, but regional managers didn't really ever know what they were doing. I had a passion about making drinks and always enjoyed getting to be on bar, even if people sometimes aren't the best. I've often thought about taking it up as a side job again, just working a few hours a week."
good,"una  empresa donde tienes contacto directo con los clientes , un lugar adecuado para aprender y tener una linea de carrera"
good,"It would get pretty stressful, morning and during rush hour. I learned how to manage my time and get many tasks done in a small amount if time.  The hardest part was how stressful drive through would get but it was always a fun environment to be apart of. I loved the people I worked with and making the coffee was very fun, I loved interacting with our regulars and meetings tons of new people."
good,"Busy environment with supportive team."
good,"Der Job als Barista hat mir an sich sehr gut bei Starbucks gefallen. Das Einzig Negative sind die vorgegebenen Arbeitsschichten und die Bezahlung. Ich finde besonders im Gastronomiegewerbe sollte man die Möglichkeit auf kleine Zwischenpausen haben. Auch finde ich nicht gut, dass kein 50% Sonntags-/Feiertagszuschlag vergütet wird, wie bei manch anderen grossen Gastroketten."
good,Starbucks is a great place with lots to offer and lots to learn but truth be told it is very emotionally draining and demanding because of the type of customer connection they promise as part of the experience of going there for your coffee. It teaches you great people skills and team work skills but there will be days where you don't have the energy or mindset to make a connection with everyone. Overall this job is a great experience and the employees are well taken care of.
good,"Starbucks is fast-paced, requires teamwork and customer service skills. Fluctuates between absolutely loving the job to being frustrated throughout the shift. But the benefits more than make up for it. Health, Vision, Dental insurance available for full and part time employees, plus 401k, stocks, and free Spotify Premium. Also, Sbux offers tuition reimbursment through Arizona State University online."
good,"My time at Starbucks was the easiest experience I've ever had. The pay was very good, and actually up a little since the kiosk I worked at didn't accept tips. My hours weren't too bad for the most part, and the security of repetition was fine with me and made my work easier."
good,Loved my job but working in such a busy location had its downfall ant many points in the day. You have to love the coffee culture. Management is very cool. Highly recommend to anyone that thinks they can handle it.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work with. They are very flexible with working with those who attend school. The benefits that they provide their employees with is very benefical to those in need.
good,"Starbucks assisted me in growing tremendously as an individual and as a leader. The district management team really knew how to coach their employees for optimal growth, development, and leadership. "
good,I love working at Starbucks. my store and my team i work with everyday is great. we all work as a team to help out each other in any way possible which is really helpful. helping our everyday customers come in and getting to know them and know there drinks is always a good feeling and gives them a smile on there face when greeting them and have there drinking ready before there done ordering or having ready the way they want it.
good,Job is fun overall if you enjoy making and serving coffee. Staff is very friendly. Work space can be a little hectic but not a big problem. Overall good job.
good,One of the many things that I really loved about working with starbucks was how supportive my co workers are. As well as how I got to meet different people daily.
good,"i worked an hour a day and it was the the best times ever. everyone was friendly and customers was willing to conversate with you,and always asked how your day was. managers was nice and was thoughtful about everyone. hardest part was leaving the job it was fun working there and you can be yourself. best part was meeting new people and making a drink record of 82 drinks in an hour. i learned people will help you if asked, learned how to make drinks."
good,"on a typical day of working at Starbucks we work really fast paced, since there is a high demand for drinks but the management and coworkers are the most kind and helping, making the work hours seem like nothing. You get to meet diffrent type of people, get familiarized with daily customers making it pleasant whenever they come in."
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with, and about 80% of the customers where amazing as well. Some bad apples, but everywhere has that!"
good,It was a great place to make friend but can't make a living working here. perfect for high schoolers. also very flexible schedule for college students
good,"I would definitely say for people to work at this company/ organization. The place is truly amazing, I have worked in 3 of their stores now. I have to say I have seen almost everything. The good and the bad, but I can truly say the customers is why I stay at this job. Learning how to make meaningful conversation that is brought together through coffee is absolutely amazing."
good,Starbucks in a good place to work if you're in retail.  Very flexible hours (even as a store manager) and the best work life balance of any job I've ever had.
good,Very easy going and lovable workplace. Fast paste between the hours of 8 a.m.-5 p.m. Loving customers. A cultural and beautiful experience for anyone looking for a place to study or just hangout  while enjoying coffee and tea beverages. Also very kid friendly with frappuccino deserts and delicious pastries.
good,"The day begins with the lead and assistant manager speaking with you about the goals for the day and expectations.You were constantly being educated about food and coffee, especially coffee, like where it was grown soil, water, temperature etc. Everyday was a learning experience because management was always helping to increase your knowledge base.  I feel the hardest part of the job was just being on hard concrete all day.  If a had to convey what I enjoyed most was the partners I had the opportunity to work with. These are young men and women who perform even the most menial task with a sense of professionalism"
good,"While the actual pay may not be the best available, the benefits are unbeatable. I received free Spotify, insurance, and 100% tuition reimbursement. I was able to graduate debt-free because of Starbucks!"
good,There are days I feel exhausted by the work because it can get hectic at times but I laugh a lot while I'm at work. I enjoy my partners very much as well as the costumers. Starbucks is a good place to work while you are going through college and growing your career. I would recommend it to any student seeking to advance thier career becasue it can be flexible for you.
good,Very fun and easy environment to work at. I love how everyone works as a team to get daily job functions done efficiently and right.   I loved how great we connect with customers.
good,Will i can say that you just have to do your job the best way you can and shoe in improvement you no i no what else to say. .i learnd from the best of the best co workers and manages I learned the best from them and supervisors coworkers i I gained a lot of experience with the people i had worked with and wood do it all over aging if i can .
good,"Starbucks has been a great experience for me overall. It helped me pay for minor expenses throughout my college days with some added benefits of free Spotify premium, weekly coffee mark outs and tips, discounted food and beverage, and even the options of stock investments or healthcare. Starbucks has changed a lot over the 2.5 years I've been there but the most recent benefit is the quickly accruing sick time which I personally haven't taken advantage of but is nice to know I have the option. My location specifically is a bit of a troublesome spot since we're located in a mall kiosk, it's a little cramped and hectic which directly impacts our low retention rate of all levels of partners. Therefore, the scheduling isn't great and it will take a good manager with lots of experience, preferably within Starbucks already, a lot of work to help our store and meet all partner needs. Our store lacks the organization and valuable customer connection of a normal cafe/driveway store. However, I've come across a multitude of different people working in a mall, customers, and partners alike, and some have really been awesome and a pleasure to work with and some are even forever friends. There's something special about Starbucks partners where the workplace environment and the people are very like-minded and seem to connect well which makes the days easier. The hardest part of the job, in my location at least, was getting through the busy mall holiday season and other special events that caused the mall and our store to be chaotic. But again, at the end of the day, it's mostly the awesome"
good,Really enjoyed working at Starbucks. meeting new people and friendly staff and mutual respect from management. lots of locations so many options to relocate
good,"I like the culture at Starbucks.  If you are a reliable worker, willing to do some menial tasks (cleaning bathrooms/floors/dishes, etc) and are willing to take orders from others, this is a perfect place to be.  The work is fast paced, fun, light hearted, and flexible.  Management can be poor depending on the store, and the ""rules"" of how tasks are performed can vary from store to store, even though technically they should be the same.  The pay is terrible, certainly not a ""living wage"", but the work is extremely flexible making working 2 jobs feasible.  The other benefits(medical/dental, 401K, stock) are fantastic."
good,Was an amazing opportunity met a lot of people. Great company benefits. If needed extra hours could pick up shift at other stores. and your Schedule is ready three weeks in advance.
good,Team work is highly encouraged and customer connection is a huge deal. It makes for a good work environment. Can be very very busy especially during the holidays.
good,"It's like being a bartender, but you don't have to deal with drunk people. Also, Starbucks is really big about baristas supporting each other on an emotional level; you go into work expecting a team, but instead you find a family."
good,"Being a Retail Store Manager for the company was exciting. You get to develop relationships with customers, partners, and more. You do not need a college degree to attain the position and you still have room to grow. Online college is paid for, great health benefits, great discount, free beverages while working, free food each day, and many more. "
good,"Has amazing benefits! Starbucks paid for my undergraduate degree in full. However, there is little work-life balance. It is incredibly competitive and fast paced. Luckily I enjoy this type of environment."
good,"This was a wonderful job experience. I grew quickly and there was an interest in me doing well. "
good,Starbucks was a good company to work for short term. The company offered great benefits and chances for advancement. They also offered good benefits and perks.
good,Always had a lot of fun. Can be really stressful but good. Had a really hard time balancing life personal life and work. The pay is not very good and the hours can be hard to work with.
good,"Working at Starbucks has not only given me ample experience with customer facing, cash handling, inventory management and gaining abilities to work in a fast paced environment."
good,"Cuando entras a trabajar a Starbucks aprendes muchas cosas, aprendes a controlar tus emociones, la atención al cliente, la manera de trabajar en un lugar totalmente limpio, calidad de alimentos, entre otras cosas. La cultura laboral que inculca Starbucks en sus colaboradores es una de las mejores, ya que desde un inicio te hace entender que el cliente es la parte más importante de la empresa y día a día lo vas entendiendo, aunque siempre van existir clientes que te harán creer que hay excepciones por su manera de tratar a las personas. Lo que más me gusto de Starbucks era que se acomodaba a mis horarios y me ayudaban con los mismos cuando ocurría una emergencia. Lo que menos me gusto fue a veces a pesar de tener la razón en en ciertas situaciones por la experiencia, salias perdiendo contra supervisor de turno."
good,"For only 20 hours a week you get to enjoy benefits, a pound of a coffee a week, enough Starbucks for anyone and a discount!"
good,"The time of work is various from 4 am to 11 pm, therefore I can manage time or I can have my free time day or night depends on what shift I have. Always guaranteed 2 days off on the full-time contract and annual leave.  after became a shift supervisor, I learned much responsibilities apart from the duty of barista. one of the best part if this job is you can meet people from around the world, learn various cultures."
good,"Starbucks is a company that cares about their employees.  Although the work can be stressful at times depending on how busy your store is, the company takes care of its own through the multiple benefits provided and the huge opportunity to go back to school and have it paid for.  I would highly recommend Starbucks to anyone looking to work for a great company, with great benefits, and a great culture."
good,"I enjoyed working here for the time that I did, I just found it stressful towards the end. I worked at a reserve store so the standards were much higher."
good,"I enjoyed the amount of hours and flexibility I was given while at Starbucks. But I was not very pleased with the management. Over the span of one year, there were three different managers, causing an unbalance in scheduling and employees."
good,"Starbucks is a good first job. They are flexible with their hours, which is ideal for college students and people with second jobs. Although the pay is not excellent, it's usually much higher than minimum wage. It's possible to move up in the company, but it can take many years depending on the local management."
good,"My coworkers and regular customers are the best part about working here. The hours are very flexible with school, the workplace is well managed, and everyone helps each other out."
good,"Gained valuable experience as a leader in high pressure situations and was able to engage in everyday interactions with customers and fellow partners.  However, training was sometimes lacking for various employees due to the training model changing from a hands on approach to a computer training session."
good,It was a fun place to work and learn how to make crafted coffee. The biggest challenge is working in the extremely fast paced environment and the alloated production time for each order.
good,Great environment to work in. They have super flexible scheduling and will work to make sure you are comfortable with the time you will be working in.
good,"-A typical day at work for me was: Clocking in, check where I will work that day and get to it. "
good,I loved every minute working for this company and would go back in a supervisory or corporate position if the opportunity presented itself. This company takes care of their employees.
good,"Much like any other retail job, Starbucks requires a fast-paced worker to either be serving the masses or cleaning supplies. "
good,It’s a good place to work. It can be overwhelming but overall good place to grow and achieve better in life. They put you through school and have good benefits.
good,"I love Starbucks, been working here for almost 5 years. Flexible and reliable job. I enjoy and appreciate the company . Great environment and culture of coffee"
good,Wonderful team of baristas that worked well together as a team that anticipated our regular's needs. Regulars continues to come to our store because they enjoyed the beverage we crafted. It was fantastic to be able to start their day with a smile and brings joy to us to see them come just to see us everyday as well.
good,"My main gripes with the job is that its somewhat difficult to move up in positions, and its hard to get over 30 hours if you're a barista. Other than that I was able to meet new people and make some good connections and friends. Benefits are great and there's a website that gives you discounts through many brands and businesses. Schedules are very flexible and hours can very, again, its hard to get over 30 hours as a barista."
good,"It was a nice job but I had one manger who consistently called me stupid on a regular basis and I quit because of it. My Store manager was really nice, and wonderful to work for however."
good,"Starbucks is a great way to get your foot in the door for coffee and more local barista positions. However, the pay is pretty low and from working at several stores the managers neglect their employees and store. Also, plan to be a cashier for awhile because barista roles are normally taken by stronger employees and it's hard to move up, very competitive. Overall, great benefits and not a bad first job, you receive coffee discounts and low healthcare packages!"
good,"More demanding than one would initially think but it is a good place to learn patience and communication skills. Always opportunities for partners to grow within the company as well as bamazing benefits such as tuition reimbursement, free drinks and meals, Stock, yearly raises, job security, and health, vision, and dental."
good,working at Starbucks is a lot of work but its also a lot of fun! Hardest part of the job is getting acclimated to the high speed pace and dealing with angry customers
good,Working for Starbucks is a bit challenging. The customers can be a little difficult but I believe that's everywhere. It's extremely fun and learning all the drinks to me is actually really fun. The benefits are great and the pay is very decent
good,Ioved to work here training provided for as long as you need it. Customers love to make up drinks for fun loved seeing my regulars daily. Meeting were made fun for everyone never boring.
good,Starbucks as a whole is an amazing company to work for!! I absolutely loved working there. I only left due to the fact that I wanted to progress and they kept me in my position due to the fact that our region was low on Shift Managers. I don't think you should halt someone's progress due to the fact that the regions managers aren't hiring properly. Overall I really really loved Starbucks!!!
good,Good job to work at when balancing school and also needed a job. The tips are nice. VERY fast faced and can be stressful. Customers are usually friendly and coworkers are nice.
good,Management could've been handled better but generally the staff team was very good to work with. The pay was very good as it was located in central london. Overall I liked the experience and the skills I gained from it.
good,"Not all supervisors will agree with their subordinates when it comes to pleasing the customer and I had first hand knowledge in this experience with a regular. Customer first, no matter what is I was taught. After all, it is a customer service role, the most enjoyable aspect of the corporate culture of the company."
good,"This is a company that used to be incredible and now is becoming a money hungry machine. Focus on your employees and not solely your sales. Every week as a team we hear how we have no labor to distribute. It hurts morale, it hurts our integrity, it honestly can cause some damage emotionally/psychologically. This is a good company that seems to have lost its way a bit. While I support my team, I cannot support the schedule cuts the higher ups are imposing."
good,"I work at one of the busiest Starbucks in northern New Jersey, definitely busy for most of the day but nothing unbearable. Many different things to learn at first but not too hard to get used to. Manager was very helpful and cared for her employees, most of the coworkers were bearable but some could slow down the day and make you do more work than necessary."
good,"The Starbucks experience can be a great one when you've got a great team. With their support, it can make the job fun and easy, which you need in such a fast-paced environment. If you enjoy constantly having things to do, this is a good pick as you're always busy. "
good,"Its a pretty typical coffee/tea customer service job.  Hours can be long, but there are benefits.  Full medical, dental, vision for only 20 hrs a week."
good,"In a typical day at work we had rush time in the mornings and during lunch, which required the top of our employees to cover those shifts while in afternoons we mostly trained the new ones. I learned a lot in leadership skills, whenever there was something that needed to be done, even as a simple barista, I did what had to be done even if it was a supervisor's job. Management was alright, we barely had any problems with it. We always carried our Starbucks spirit with joy and our customers loved it. I can say that the hardest part of the job was applying any and all rules to the letter and not make a tiny mistake that could be fixed, that is why the oldest crew stayed vigilant with the new ones. The most enjoyable part was making new friends and having your customers trust you with their desires."
good,"Great atmosphere, people are amaizng, very organised and made sure it's up to standards. Menagment uunderstandable and great to work with, always help you. Work it's self challenging however not hard."
good,"multitasking is key. you will be running around like crazy and keeping that smile strong. most customers are very kind but others can be a bit snippy, all depends on the store location you are at. if you want an active hands on job it is worth the stress and you can move from barista to manager in 2 years easy. there are endless opportunities"
good,"it was awesome at times when we had a rush and so fast-paced and fun!! but I learned the hard way that some people are mean and awful when it comes to their cup of coffee, and, at 16, people's harsh words got to me, unfortunately. I'm now 20 years old and haven't worked there in 2 years but I wouldn't be the same person I am today, had I not worked there; that job taught me to grow thick skin and made me a better worker and I regret nothing."
good,"It was a great place to work for people that have more than one job, or are going to school. Management was great, and worked very well with conflicting schedules. It was a lot of fun, you have a chance to be creative with tons of combinations of drinks. I'd say the hardest part of the job was peak, they are very competitive when it comes to drive-thru times and how many drinks are made per hour etc. they have great benefits, 401k, stock options."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work because they really care about their employees. The system on the floor is perfected down to a tee to maximize efficiency. It is fast-paced, so you must be able to keep up. If you've worked in a restaurant, you'll get the hang of it. The management is very hands-on; they have periodic meetings with each partner (employee) just to ensure we're all on the same page, and there is always a shift supervisor on the floor. All in all, it is a fun place to work with great benefits and pay."
good,"Starbucks is not an easy job, but if you show up to work with the right attitude, and work well with your team then it is honestly one of the best places to work in the world. There are many small benefits that make working there nice, but overall I do not feel i was compensated enough for the work that I did. My coworkers and regular customers are the reasons I would show up to work every day, and the free coffee was a great motivator to keep me coming back."
good,"great place to work , Starbucks was a stepping stone for me . i loved the people i worked with. Starbucks is a great company to come back to if needed in the future"
good,"Eğlenceli çalışma ortamı"
good,Management team was very understanding to each other. I had learned a lot about how to manage team on archieve targetting sales market and handling the baristas to keep our branch always make customer highly satisfaction during walk away from our store.
good,"This company has earned its popularity by maintaining a great quality business. Starbucks holds a welcoming environment, is widely available, and serves a variety of menu options. Starbucks has a unique, modern style. Starbucks creates a place fitting to the environment, giving them a truly natural and positive vibe. Locals are most likely to feel at home at their surrounding locations. The employees at every location always fit in perfectly as well. The alternative styles and quirky personalities of Starbucks employees make for authentic coffeehouse vibes."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you are trying to level up in a company that will benefit your life in every way possible. Great partners and great management.
good,"SB is a high performance customer-centric company. For my personality, I didn't quite fit in and was let go as a result. I hold no grudge over the manager or the company, but others should know the price of their Emotional Labour."
good,I really liked my location. The staff was great and my manager was understanding and helped me out whenever i needed. They have a cup fund where associates can donate to and take out money when needed for emergencies.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great experience for me. Great co-workers, understanding management, great products. Difficult customers, fast paced environment. Not enough workers to handle the amount of orders, especially during happy hour promotions (which last for a whole shift, not for an hour)."
good,Working at Starbucks is like having a second family. Everyone is always there for you even if it’s not about work. People at Starbucks get along so perfectly and easily.
good,"Good to work at starbucks. You get good discounts and benefits are good."
good,Location was in the mall. Steady pace of a work day. Peak hours were extremely busy due to breaks and lunches and other shoppers in the mall. Somewhat slow during early mornings and mid-day due to school.
good,"It was a fast paced environment and very demanding work. However, the atmosphere was amazing and you often left feeling better than you did at the start of your shift due to the great coworkers and management. The emphasis on customer service made customer connections genuine and not forced. Overall, a great place to work where you will learn a lot about human connection."
good,"Free pound of coffee weekly"
good,The benefits were the best benefits any company has given me and I love what Starbucks does to be environmentally friendly. I would definitely suggest this company to anyone. Awesome company!
good,Starbucks enabled my and family and I to have full benefits while working part time.  I never really received a paycheck as all my money I earned weekly went to benefits for my family.
good,"Overall its not a bad place to work, its a lot of work, and can be rather exhausting, but ultimately it comes down to whether your store can funciton well as a team or if everyone is out for themselves."
good,"Starbucks is a good job for people of all walks of life. Don't expect it to be a chill walk-in-the-park kind of job though. It is still a job. Sometimes you get to sit and sip coffee (if you are working towards mastering or learning, or if you are sharing or doing a coffee tasting) but most of it is hustle. It is still customer service."
good,"Worked there for about a year while I was going to school, they worked with my schedule well so I could have time to myself outside of work and school"
good,"I have worked for Starbucks for almost one year. It's very fast paced, but we all enjoy working there. Management is very fair and provides feedback to each employee on a regular basis. The hardest part of the job is during peak hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great group of people."
good,"It was the first job I ever had. I had my good moments and bad moments on the job, but overall, it was a nice experience and I don't regret a thing. It prepared me for a lot of experiences I may have received from other jobs."
good,"It was a relaxed work place that you could be yourself, do your job, and learn so many new things. I loved getting to meet new people everyday and forming professional relationships with the regular customers."
good,I've worked 5 days a week. I learned to communicate well with otehr people. The most enjoyable part of my work is having a good relationship with my co-workers.
good,"Met some of the best friends working this job! I loved the environment and culture of the job, just wish they paid better. Beware, if you don't like a fast paced environment, this may not be for you, personally I got energy from it!"
good,"It's a great part time job. Don't expect anything near full-time unless you want to train to be a manager."
good,Great job for growth grey employees  friendly customers flexible schedule schooling benefits great coffe communication between all was spectacular and long lasting friendships
good,"The only complaint would be the hours. They hire a lot of people so hours are small, managers favorites get the most hours. The only thing for your uniform they give you in the hat and apron. Otherwise the environment is super chill and fun when working with cool people."
good,"While my Starbucks was not corporate and we did not recieve the same benefits, it was a fun environment to work in!  Everyone was friendly and since everyone was a college student, my managers and co-workers were collaborative on making sure everyone's schedules worked out during finals and making sure an individual's shift was filled if they could not make it.  "
good,"· Architect responsible for supervision and reopening of the Starbucks Store. Simultaneously managing the fulfillment of the schedule and the financial forecast, managing all professionals compromising the quality and the time."
good,"The hardest part of the job was staying calm when the job got stressful. "
good,"As a coffee shop, there are lulls and busy moments. The lulls are filled with cleaning, maintenance, and coffee prepping. The peaks can be very busy, but not overwhelming as your co-workers act as a sort of conveyor belt for efficiently and quickly fulfilling orders."
good,"Hardest part of the job was the customers. With very high expectations, quality assurance, and little patience for new baristas, it is hard to jump into this position. Once you get the hang of the menu and the store layouts though it can become a great and fun job! Push through those first few months!!"
good,"Great company, hard to promote above store manager. With leadership experience it is a great job, promotes might struggle, but it is a reasonable job."
good,"A day at work in Starbucks is so enjoyable because from the minute you walk into work you get greeted by all your coworkers. You put on that green apron and you don't even feel like you're going to work you are just going to be able to try and make someone's day that much better. You get to know your customers and hopefully remember their names, you get to learn about what is going on in their lives and you even see friendships begin from those connections you are making at work. For sure the most trying time at work is when we have our promotions and it gets crazy busy, or when a manager comes onto the floor and starts to stress out, and takes that stress out on our partners and it begins to stress us out when we could definitely work more efficiently and pleasantly if we weren't being nagged during busy hours.  But overall, working has Starbucks has been so enjoyable and memorable."
good,a typical day at work was busy with customers constantly walking through the door. Management set up allowed for breaks to be taken during shift allowing for employees not to stress over how busy it was.
good,"I was super addicted to caffeine by the time I left, but overall this was a good job to work at. All my coworkers were friendly and management was highly supportive."
good,"It was a lot of fun working with my partners while maintaining a professional appearance and a great experience for each guest. It can be fast paced sometimes, but that's when the friendly competitions would kick in, and the overall moral of the work place would increase."
good,"A typical day at Harris Teeter, you take customers complicated and not so complicated orders and make their drinks and one person goes to the back to “pull” pastries and sandwiches from the freezer in a opening shift and just pastries in a closing shift. I️ learned how to properly clean dishes, counter tops, floors, even in small places. Management has always been a good experience. They're very kind, but at the same time they are strict and know how to get the job done proficiently. They’re trained in every department and check up on you to see if you’re in dress code, if you’ve taken a lunch or break and see how things are going within your shift. Coworker are very nice, you make many friends and they are very welcoming to new hires. The hardest part about the job is keeping everything tidy in a rush and remembering to keep the pastry case filled and date the refreshers and milks considering we go through over 5 of each milk every day. We typically use 10-12 2% milk gallons, 5-10 skim milk gallons, 7-10 whole milk gallons, 5-7 soy milk cartons, 5-7 coconut milk cartons, 7-10 almond milk cartons, 7 heavy cream half gallons, and 2-3 half and half gallons. The most enjoyable part of working there is the friendships with your coworkers and connections you make with the customers. Seeing their smiles when you memorize they’re orders so it’s ready once they finish paying."
good,"Overall, I loved working at Starbucks. For the most part it was a great fast-paced environment with a great team. I loved management at first, but slowly it all started to go downhill. Management is never stable, we've gone through three store managers within the year. With such a fast-paced and at times stressful environment, it makes it hard to work with such unreliable management. That's the worst part of it, though. Starbucks is an awesome company to work for. It's fun, fast-paced and I feel that corporate does care for the partners. I will miss it for sure. I've been at this store for 2 years and I've worked really hard for this company, missing weddings and graduations. I'm coming to the time that I realize I can't work at Starbucks (essentially a fast-food company) for the rest of my life. I want to get a start on my professional career."
good,Though theres quite a learning curve I believe starbucks to be one of the best entry level jobs available to young adults. The pay is decent and the benefits are above average.
good,"In an era of fleeting job benefits and endless contract positions, Starbucks offers great benefits, competitive pay and an accepting job culture that is hard to find elsewhere."
good,"great training, opportunity to move up, good benefits, good transfer program, good quality food, paid time off, maternity leave, bonuses, employee discount"
good,If you work mornings you usually get what we call 'peak' which is our busiest part of the day its when we see the most customers and have the most interactions. You're preparing food and drinks at a face pace. Once it begins to slow down we are cleaning but also attend to the customers who are still coming in. Working nights its a bit slower more cleaning gets done but also while the customers are taken care of. The hardest part about the job is sometimes there is not enough staffing so you are stuck doing more than one job. the easiest part is working with your coworkers and getting to know your customers. It's a great place to work friendly fast and efficient but also great benefits.
good,"Constant change, company added more work and limited raises. The management team was supportive, but it was difficult to maintain a fully staffed floor due to labor restrictions."
good,"You will over time get to know the regular customers for a particular store location, and what they like to order. Learning the drinks is fun to make."
good,"I was at Starbucks for about 2 months and was never fully trained, which was stressful when we were busy, but the managers were kind, and you get a free meal with every shift you have a lunch, and you get unlimited free drinks during any shift."
good,"My experience at Starbucks is a great one. I enjoyed working alongside a group of fun, outgoing, people. Starbucks goes above and beyond in ensuring career growth."
good,"Despite the usual craziness of a busy afternoon, the experience working for Starbucks was great. The staff of people you get to associate with as well as being a part of the environment was an unmatched experience."
good,I love working for Starbuck. I feel like I'm at home when I'm at work and the environment is very welcoming and homey. I really appreciate how much the company has done for me and how much theyve been here for me.
good,"Working cashier/ barista at Starbucks was a fun position, managers and coworkers had great attitudes towards one an other and the job was very understandable because the training course was successful."
good,"Working at Starbucks there was a large focus on making every customer experience right. They had plenty of opportunities for advancement. Great training services to develop customer service skills and career direction. On top of these there are great benefits for school, health, retirement, and investing. Though the hours can be difficult for close to open shifts."
good,Muy buena empresa para aprender sobre el servicio al cliente.
good,The company is really good to its workers. Full benefits and and a lot of perks. The environment is like having a second family. Definitely a great experience for a first job!
good,There’s never a boring day at Starbucks. There is always something to do. Yo will always have work that needs to be done which I like because it keeps me busy and the days go by much faster.
good,"Working at starbucks was a great experience for me aside from my management, who promised me more hours than I ever ended up getting. It was a great workplace environment aside from that."
good,"It's a stressful and fast-paced environment but you get to work with great people that make the job fun, you develop new friendships. "
good,"Great job for students they are flexible in hours and maintain professional standards. Great place to work good wages, good management. The staff at all locations  are great to work alongside. would recommend this job to anyone looking for a good place to work.Love that they offer benefits to all employees including part time workers."
good,"This job seems easy and fun. Honestly (depending on your team) it is... if, AND ONLY, if you have *amazing* work ethic. If you walk into a Starbucks and think “this looks easy and like fun” it’s 100% because the team working works hard and gets along. It’s an easy job at its base but you need to be willing to do your share. It doesn’t take a degree but you need to know what common sense is and what it means to work. You always have something to do, cleaning, recovering from a rush, or defusing and angry customer situation. Everyone from barista to manager is expected to be able to stand their own, answer questions, and be confident in their knowledge."
good,"Starbucks is definitely a fun and new way to learn, meet new people and create a Starbucks experience. Management will always recognize the people supporting the store in the most positive way!"
good,Great place to start a retail career. A lot of benefits and resources available as well. Flexible hours and a great pay rate. And they also pay for you to go to school if you’d like.
good,Your experience working here really depends on who you're working with With great partners it's much less stressful. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the many drink orders while also dealing with customers that are throwing questions and complaints at you.
good,"Make friends with you co-workers, it makes the company much more fun. Try to work in the mornings, that way you can work a full day and still have the entire afternoon off as well."
good,Un posto dove apprendere tecniche e meccaniche molto buone e adatte anche per altre tipologie di lavoro.
good,"Highly motivated "
good,It is a fast-paced work environment during the mornings and weekends. It tends to be less so during the evenings. It is a place where teamwork reigns.
good,Great place to work for students and for families with a two parent income. Very fast paced during the morning and lunch rush. Great atmosphere for team building.
good,"Starbucks offers amazing benefits to its partners and other than minimum pay it is a great place for advancement and gaining experience.  Most baristas and supervisors are laid back, friendly and very personable."
good,"The day was always busy and I had good co workers to help lessen the stress of work but overall it was great, always Lit and fun At work and I love the smell of expresso"
good,Very good company. every three moths there was a change so that was good. I enjoyed working with my team as a family unit where we always helped one another out.
good,"Starbucks was a great job to work while I was saving money for school. My schedule was always flexible, I loved the crew that I worked with, and my manager was incredible! At this job, I learned how well I excelled at Customer Service, and how much of leader I was, even in a position that called for no leadership at all."
good,"On a typical day you run your floor during peak hours and when the business slows you complete administrative work. If you are great at your job and have reliable employees, making the schedule, developing partners, and reviewing key metrics to grow your business is a brief. You must be great a time management for this job because if you schedule time to do the work, it must be done or you can end up working over."
good,it was a great place to work but in my 6 years there I did go through periods of hating it. Its fast paced and way more stressful then I ever thought coffee making would be. Having a bad manager makes it a super difficult job too so make sure you have a good one. I miss working there but I'm also glad to have moved on.
good,"Always changed management, lack of organization and balance between employees and there worked shifts. Overall I think it would be a great complaint to work for in a different location."
good,"Starbucks is a fantastic place to work! They offer benefits starting at only twenty hours/week, and you can create a flexible schedule to work around school, family, travel, etc. They are also a socially responsible company. They give back to the communities where they buy their coffee, and hold all their employees to a high level of customer service and sensitivity. It is also possible to move up from a barista to higher levels, even all the way up to a regional manager, which is an excellent opportunity for anyone looking for a career."
good,"It was very high volume kiosk in Ingles Makets,it mad it a little tough to run interference between the two corporations,but nothing that I couldnt handle. Im a morning person so the hours were great for me. I quickly made the Department Manager,so advancent is always in reach,very encouraging."
good,"Very fast-paced environment but there were down times. "
good,"Understand : this is a Starbucks kiosk located with in a Kroger grocery store. That being said, management and the people who end up lasting through the training period are amazing."
good,With Starbucks I had the opportunity to learn customer service through connecting with customers and providing the Starbucks experience for each and every one. I learned how the business was run at an optimal level that keeps Starbucks as a top competitor. I learned the ability to accept responsibility for mistakes whether I made them or the customer did so that I protected each customers experience. I also developed and strengthened my social skills through communicating effectively with customers and partners.
good,I thought it was a fun work environment and I learned to have a god relationship with the customer and the management was great. I also learned to be aware of other people and learned how to make coffee in many different was and non coffee drinks as well.
good,"fast paced environment, need to memorize, and work as a team. Weekly pay and benefits are a plus when working at Starbucks. Management can be strict about dress code"
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company with great benefits. If you just want a part-time job, then this would be a good job for you. If you are looking for a job with a livable salary, then you may want to look better, however, co-worker relationships are amazing and it is a safe and fun environment and family"
good,"Starbucks is a positive atmosphere, but also a fast paced job that requires time management and multitasking skills. Easy to learn and amazing benefits!"
good,"Working at Starbucks for five years was the most enjoyable experience of my life. My coworkers and managers became more like friends. Meeting new customers every day, some never having set foot in a Starbucks. Learning new and creative ways to make all kinds of different drinks."
good,"Working at Starbucks is very fun and exciting. You meet a lot of different people from all across the globe. It is fast paced, and can get frustrating all of the time with all of the drink recipes. However, it is a great job to have a student, single person, or someone with a family."
good,"Really research what store you wish to apply at! Take time to sit in the cafe and order a drink, observe the staff and if you can the manager. Relocated to a different area, with a new manager and have completely different experiences. My original store was filled with a great staff and supportive management, on top of the many benefits that Starbucks provides. Now in a new location, under poor management that drives me insane. Be sure to ask around about various Starbucks locations before applying or accepting a position at certain cafes."
good,Working for Starbucks was one of the best jobs that I've had in the past few years. Most of the time the other people that are hired are ready to show you the ropes and help you get to where you need to be in the routine.
good,The environment was great and iv'e met so many different friendly people. they are so kind .Its fast casual  and a quick paced area so i'm used to the extreme business we get especially in the morning.I try to build as many ongoing relationships with coworkers and visitors traveling leaving and returning home. My job is to leave an impression that they will remember. I have many people return with great stories and smiles that it makes me excited to go to work and see the guests.
good,Genuinely enjoyed my time there and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an early morning gig. Great job if you're able to work at a quick pace with a friendly attitude
good,Steep learning curve and holiday rushes can be brutal but overall a great experiences. I learned valuable interpersonal skills working with customers and coworkers.
good,"es un buen lugar para trabajar, pero hay que saber manejar los tiempos para cada uno, y repartir roles por igual, no que uno llegue y se ponga a limpiar todos los dias los baños por ejemplo y casi nunca estar en linea o en caja para practicar mas"
good,It was an amazing first job. The work/school life balance was amazing and the hours I received were amazing. There we're busy times where the job required much of me but i overall met up to its standards.
good,"Good for learning to work fast paced. Good for students, not good for students supporting themselves and school payments.  The brand is progressive and supportive."
good,"Working there is both very fun and serious job. I enjoy making new drinks and having conversations with new customers and our regulars, but always have in mind that drinks should be made in a fast paced environment to guarantee customers satisfaction. Strongly team oriented, friendly and helpful co-workers."
good,"It is nice to daily interact with the guests. Nice environment overall, we respect one another no matter what background we have. If the pay rate was higher it would have been a great place to stay and develop your management skills."
good,"You get to meet a lot of people and make a lot of friends. Other baristas supervisers and managers may even start to feel like extended family. Starbucks is very generous in that, if you see a customer having a bad day, you are encouraged to give them a free coffee and turn their day around."
good,Nice fast paced environment with lovely people to work with. Management for the most part is willing to work with their employees and around their day to day schedule.
good,"Great company to work for, really help to develope me and watch me grow. i was vey pleased with the management and all the opportunities the company offered me. I also made some very good friends"
good,"The best part of the job is the people, customers and fellow baristas. As a supervisor the job can get a little stressful with constant high expectations from management."
good,"Get to meet a lot of great people."
good,lots of customer service and fun way to engage in problem solving. the job can be challenging at times but for the most part its super easy. We try to provide the best customer service
good,"It is a fast-paced environment, which could be stressful at times. But, it is a fun and safe work environment. You are able to learn how interact with customers, and work in a group setting."
good,"I love working at starbucks , friendly people and nice to wake up to the smell of coffee:) I really want people to like coming to starbucks so we always put a smile on our faces while we are on the floor:)"
good,A typical day included getting there to open the store around 5am and working until 1:30. Morning rush brought challenges but I learned how to stay calm and work well under pressure.  Management was good when they were hired from within the company.  I had one manager that had been with the company for years and one who came from Target.  The one who had been with the company longer connected with staff and had a real passion for the coffee culture.  The culture was my favorite part of the job.  Shared passion for coffee was a given with the staff and the laid back atmosphere was enjoyable.  The hardest part had to be the customers.  You have to deal with people being very picky and sometimes rude.  It helps to remember that these people have not had their coffee yet  and that you are there to give them that cup if morning happiness to get through the day.
good,"Although Starbucks pays above average, it still is an average job. Bad store = bad work life, good store = good one. Customers can be challenging but it is a service job non the less. A typical day includes working through the morning rush, cleaning, prepping for evening, evening cleaning and closing tasks. My store has amazing coworkers and generally a good customer base. We're considered a high volume store and because of that the job initially overwhelming. Once you have the basics down it becomes fun. Moving up is fairly easy at my store because we see a lot of turn over due to being in a military heavy town. The job itself isn't hard, its your attitude that makes it."
good,This a very fast paced and customer oriented company. You meet a lot of awesome people but not enough income to make a living off of. I love working here due to the lively coffee environment and the techniques.
good,"If you are looking for a great environment mixed with fast paced and productive work, Starbucks is great for you. It was pleasant to be there but I had to leave due to my conflicting work schedule with my other job."
good,"If you can multi task, keep a clean place and smile this will work for you. I loved the variety of drinks and the specific way particular customers always wanted their drink. I like being able to have a relationship with my customers. People smile when you give them something that looks presentable, smells nice and they know it’s delicious s also gives you opportunities to learn so much about their products, you’ll be suggesting what customers should try."
good,"A typical day at the location I worked at would be busy you have to multitask, communicate and stay on your feet. I personally learned a lot and would improve everyday, I mean for me it did. The time I was hired I did not get proper training, so for me learning drinks, I would get them down however for working almost a year, I should have the ability to work behind the bar. But it makes me uncomfortable. Which I wouldn't get the ability to get full training behind the bar. The culture is amazing! Management has improved, there is a new manager, and the work place before was laid back and now its still is to be able to have fun and poke fun with people but a bit more stricter. I love Starbucks and I recommend it for any student because it is part-time. It's not for someone trying to have a steady income."
good,"if you’re a student in school, they are really flexible with hours. it’s also very easy to pick up hours if you need more. overall it’s a friendly environment, and you will get along with mainly everyone. there are a lot of cleaning tasks, but with a strong team it’s not that bad. you’re able to have fun with coworkers, and customers. there’s such a wide variety of benefits that range from 401k plans, insurance plans , stocks, commuter benefits, and so much more. great job to start with"
good,"Starbucks es muy buena empresa con excelente trato al personal, y lo que mas me gusto de ahi, es el trato con los clientes"
good,It's a great job if you don't mind high paced environments and cleaning. It's not difficult once you learn it and the benefits are really nice. The flexible schedule is nice too.
good,"Starbucks as a barista is flexible and great for a college job. They offer many benefits such as health, dental, vision, 401k, stocks, and discounts throughout the US. Learning register, drinks, and cleaning procedures take time to get used to. Coworkers are great and helpful. Once you have everything down the job becomes a lot more enjoyable."
good,"Starbucks isn't just a job, it's a community. A place where you become more than just co workers, you become friends and family. I've had many jobs, but I believe Starbucks showed me the most life experience and a sense of partnership over any other place of employment that I've had."
good,"A typical day a work was fast passed and a little demanding, but it was good work. Just like any work environment the day had its ups and downs. Great group of people to work with and it was a great first job."
good,"En general un buen ambiente laboral con retroalimentaciones, buenas prestaciones, capacitación constante. Referente a la gerencia que me tocó, la persona tenia un temperamento muy fuerte y al momento de algún error levantaba de mas la voz."
good,"The best part about working at Starbucks is the people you work with and the people you meet on a daily basis. It's something about the Starbucks culture that always make you feel like you're right where you belong. In just a few short weeks your coworkers and your customers all blend together and become your family. The hardest part is, at times, the job can be too fast paced and overwhelming. Too many times I remember being short on staff. Nothing about the store operates right when it's not enough employees there to keep up with the demand in the store."
good,"Starbucks was my first job out of high school, meant to be a quick part time thing- ended up being a full time job for over 4 years. I enjoyed getting to know the customers all while having fun and making a decent wage plus tips. The company has good values and treat their employees well but it is hard to move up past a shift/ assistant manager position. Starbucks likes to say the promote within but I've seen way to many hard working baristas get over shadowed by some kid with a bachelors right out of college. If you find a good store with people you like, the job will be great."
good,"Best workplace culture I have ever encountered. Must be a team player, though individual strengths are celebrated and personal growth is a huge element of the job."
good,"Starbucks itself is a great company to work for. I quit because they switch managers up to every 6 months to a year and I didn't get along with the last manager placed at my store.  I learned so much about being a team and a family, I made the most friends at Starbucks than any other place I have worked at.  It's great for someone who can't sit still or have a desk job.  It's fast paced and a lot of fun when working with the right team. The partners there are very supportive and won't make you feel stupid if you don't understand something.  Loved it here until the new manager showed up."
good,"everybody works together, have a positive energy every time you go to work and pay raises yearly but wish there was more opportunities for advancement."
good,"great first job, but it's very fast paced and can be very stressful. it's a good place to grow and develop people skills. It helped me overcome some anxieties I had as a kid."
good,"El trabajo que se realiza en tienda es bastante ya que se debe trabajar en todos los puestos: atención directa con cliente en caja, entrega de comida y/o cafés y además, en mi caso, temas administrativos. "
good,"Realmente es una gran empresa, que forma muy bien a sus empleados. "
good,Work is usually very fast paced and fun but most times hectic. I learned alot from my long journey there how to smile more and become a better person. I enjoyed my co workers a great deal they definitely made my days there a bit easier.
good,"Starbucks is just a really fun environment to work in. I really wish I could go back. I love the customers and I love the workers. Of course, it was not all perfect but it was overall pretty good. I highly recommend. Although if you dislike a fast pace job, look for a different one because it is very quick."
good,"although morning and evening rushes can be stressful, with the right team, the work environment can be fun but challenging. The right manager and supervisors support and encourage you to not give up when you feel down"
good,"A typical work day in the morning at Starbuck's was almost always super busy. The staff and I were suited up and ready to go. I enjoyed working with my partners on the floor. It was hard when we were maybe short a person. I gained alot of friends and some were like family. The cons about this job is it's hard to advance. Overrall, it was a great place to work."
good,"i loved working at Starbucks, i didn't want to leave but i didn't have the proper transportation to be able to go back and forth due to lack of hours and low pay."
good,Typically Id come in and everyone would greet me with a smile but there was still trash talk and stuff going in the backroom. I think most of the issue was that we only had a little bit of space really. It was a really small store.
good,Starbucks has the best system in terms of operating and training. In fact every organization should study and learn something from this company. I have learned so much and it will benefit me for my entire life.
good,Starbucks bugüne kadar en keyif aldığım iş ortamına sahip. İşinizi zevk alarak yaparsanız mutlu olacağınız bir yer. Maaş gününde yatar. Genel olarak pozitif bir düşüncem var.
good,"Probably the hardest I have ever worked in my life. A lot of people people think its just about making coffee, but its so much more. You must have the ability to move quickly, and think even faster. Also, If you are not already great at multitasking, this is not the job for you. "
good,Good job with very flexible hours ! Good for people who arectymrying to finish school without  having to worry about working so much. You can work one day a week and still keep your job.
good,The hardest part of the job is the customers; they are also the best part.  You will learn a lot about yourself and grow as a person after working with this team.
good,Great company for those who love people! I traveled a lot and my manager always worked with my schedule and never said no. I was able to get the hours I wanted and I loved it!
good,"It just depends where the Starbucks is located. Some days were super slow. Weekends are always busy. We worked by ourselves most shifts but only for 5 hours if you’re alone. Good experience to have, you’ll never be out of a job if you know how to work at Starbucks. Easy job to learn. Not too demanding. Some people are crazy about their coffee and some just don’t know what they want."
good,Working at Starbucks really allowed me to enjoy getting up in the morning. Working with a large variety of personalities was challenging but also rewarding. What I took away from Starbucks was to treat everyone with the same respect because their morning trip to Starbucks could set the tone for the rest of their day.
good,"Te capacitan desde el principio, aprendes a trabajar bajo presión, el servicio al cliente de manera personalizada, nunca te aburres siempre hay algo que hacer o algo que aprender por lo que trabajar en la marca es muy divertido, cansado en ocasiones pero un cansancio bueno, definitivamente lo volvería a hacer."
good,"Starbucks is like a home, honestly everyone gets close and it feels like a secret world only you guys live in and understand. There is so much to learn, not just about coffee but about things thatll help you in the future. I learned a lot and I was able to gain knowledge and friends Ive had for years."
good,I worked at a Starbucks under HMHOST at the airport. Working at the airport was fun in that we met so many different people but at the same time customers we much more difficult in that they were in more of a rush then a Starbucks out on the street. I love being a barista because I would try to make the drinks the best. The only downside to this job was that the management was incredible short staffed so many tasks of the stores would be brought upon us normal baristas.
good,"The atmosphere is very fun and energetic. I really enjoy my customers and the personal interactions I get to have with them. The make the job that much more enjoyable. Although, I find that the workplace can be very exhausting and when I first started was very hard to navigate. The repetition of drink making and routine is nice although it is tedious. However, the demand for drive-thru times makes it very difficult to have that customer interaction. Ultimately, I think that if Starbucks didn't stress the drive-thru times as much I would enjoy working there as not only would I get the customer interaction in the cafe but also the drive-thru. I think we often forget that we are there for the customers, that's why people pick Starbucks instead of Tim Hortons."
good,I’ll definitely recommend a company to work for because it’s a fun environment and a learning experience. Sometimes it depend of the store where your work if you will like it or not
good,one day as I was walking into work I received a round of applause from everyone working because I had received employee of the month. It was a great experience.
good,A great place to learn how to make drinks and practice your interpersonal communication skills. Starbucks also provides awesome benefits towards college students and flexible hours.
good,Every day is different and you can meet many people!
good,"flexible hours, decent benefits, and good coworkers. (hope for hard-working coworkers.)"
good,"I enjoyed working here.  It was lots of fun.  Very relaxed environment, made great friends, and loved the atmosphere and vision of the company.  Great place for networking as well."
good,"My typical day of work included me clocking in and working the front registers or the drive through. Though it could be very fast paced at times, it was a great environment to work at. In return, the environment produced great customers who regularly came back for more coffee. Hardest part of the job were the rushes, which could come out of nowhere. I worked evening and closing weekday shifts, so typically, we didn't have a lot of staff on board.  Rushes could come out of nowhere and if you were short staffed, it could be chaos. However, if everyone knows their roles, it's still chaos, but it's a little easier."
good,"I felt this place was great, but not upper management. I felt there was to much stress and every manager I worked for was over worked. They over expect of their managers. Culture was okay, great benefits and work life balance"
good,"Working at Starbucks is both fast paced and relaxed. If you can get over the rude customers you'll be fine. The only thing I don't understand is the pay, for all of the things you have to learn the starting pay should be more than $9/hour."
good,Very stressful as it can get very busy during peaks but can be a fun environment. Establishes great teamwork. Offers great benefits. Partner development.
good,"I had fun accommodating to customers of all rank, gender, and race. I believe in good luck from working at th is job! and working here, I charmed my way into the coffee industry!"
good,"You can have a good day at work if you are able to dismiss awkward customers etc.."
good,"I personally enjoy working at Starbucks due to its quick pace and the craft going into each beverage. i wouldn't recommend this job to people who cant act quickly on their feet tho."
good,Developed from a barista to a manager and have loved the culture and customer experience even during stressful times. Training at Starbucks develops skills far beyond the workplace useful in personal life and other career endeavors.
good,"It's a great place to work! I miss it very much.There was A TON of stuff to learn in the beginning, but it was pretty easy to pick up. My Mgr. was AWESOME!!"
good,"At my Starbucks store location, crowds were a constant. You had to make beverages in a fast paced environment and provide quality and great service. What I learned is how to make customers happy and gain lasting relationships. Management was great. Always there and helpful. Culture was also great. The hardest part was the holidays when there was no breaks, just a constant flow of people in and out of the store. The most enjoyable part was making someones day."
good,"typical day working there well be busy but at the end of  the day its slow rude customer,but will be chill. i learned how to brew coffee the smell of coffee how to taste coffee, how to make drinks as well some what of latte art. Management is great but gives people who been in the company longer more hours which is bad. Workplace culture is great, good spot. The hardest part of the job is when its busy and only one espresso machine is working."
good,Overall was a great job with wonderful benefits. Fun work environment and a good place to work if you are in school or just need something part time. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
good,"I absolutely love working at Starbucks. As someone who has worked part-time with many different companies, I believe that Starbucks definitely tops all other. Aside from the amazing benefits (such as stock investments, 401k, raises) you are given many opportunities to move up in the company. Management is amazing, and understands the needs of everyone who is employed. Truly a unique experience at Starbucks."
good,You master the art of multi tasking working for Starbucks. You must be quick on your feet and learn how to keep your composure while tasking and providing superb customer service.
good,"fun environment with great perks such as free coffee. you are not paid great, and not always given the hours you need. It is defiantly a part time job."
good,Working at Starbucks was a very favorable experience. Majority of the people I worked with cared for me and even after I left I still maintain a relationship with them.
good,"Opportunity and a relaxed quick paced environment with great benefits, although there are only 20 hours for anyone who works there each week... the pay to start out is ok, the benefits make it worth it. However it is not enough to live on alone for most."
good,When you are starting off your work career and the benefits are great and anyone can get them but depending on your status determines when. It is a very easy job and it all starts with common sense.
good,"I really loved working at Starbucks. The particular location I was at, I had difficulty getting the hours I preferred, however otherwise I had very few complaints. Any role in the food industry can be stressful, but Starbucks does a really good job of helping you learn to keep up, and providing ample break time. Management did a good job of listening to, and working with concerns. Good people to work with, and there was a good atmosphere of camaraderie."
good,"Good to work in tata Starbucks awesome culture and  facilities like free beverage and food ,safe working environment, well managed Authorities and supportive"
good,"work culture, while explicitly laid out by corporate, is utilized differently per location. Personally I have had a wonderful time working for Starbucks and taking advantage of the college scholarship benefit."
good,"Fast paced and friendly environment depending on the store and management. Fair compensation and benefits offered are great. Starbucks really cares about their employees and listens to them. I will say though, they are a pretty greedy corporation and the customers are generally not very nice."
good,"Depending on the shift and who you worked with, it was fun. There were a lot of really cool people that I met. Both partners and customers. I have some really good memories."
good,"Being a partner was an extremely rewarding experience. My other partners at my store became my second family, and i wouldn't have had it any other way. The work could be stressful at times, especially at peak hours or during the holidays, but you can always count on your other partners to support you. "
good,"Everyday of work was something to look forward to, you never knew what to expect every work day. Such fun environment and being a barista was pretty easy going it always kept you busy. I think Starbucks baristas should at lease get paid 11.50 ."
good,it was fast paced but the clients we got everyday were awesome and kind. We grew to be the number one store in our district due to our unparalleled customer service.
good,"Management will work with you as far as training and schedule"
good,"Within 2 years of my carrer in starbucks i earned tons of experiemce regardimg customer service ,sales promotion ,smooth runnin of the businessss and lots of more."
good,Definitely a good job to kickoff your work life. The environment provides opportunities to become enthusiastic about parts of the business and the benefits are decent.
good,"It is a special experience for me to work starbucks."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is all about customer connection and giving them a world-class customer service. In order to do that,  we start off by giving them a warm welcome as soon as they walk in the store. Next is we own and personalise the moment with them by asking for their name and making sure that we get their drinks correctly and according to their liking. Lastly, we connect with them by making an eye contact and thanking them."
good,"Very high volume work environment where the main focus is excellent customer service and connections with the customers. Very fun environment to work in, where each partner is trained to work in any position on the floor."
good,Working at Starbucks is honestly a wonderful experience. all employees agree. Except when i moved to the ellensburg store i was constantly bullied and talked down on and everyone there is so negative and doesn't want to work there. which doesn't set new employees up for a good work environment. Normally its fun and you grow really close with the customers and coworkers and they have amazing benefits.
good,"Hardest part: memorization of codes"
good,"It was a very fun job, it was a very young aged work environment at my store, so it made the day go by much quicker. Of course you deal with a lot of hard to deal with customers, but it was expected."
good,Starbucks has helped me value working with a team. I have also crafted a better compassion for serving others and giving back to my community. The hardest part of this job is the long hours with a lot of physical labor.
good,"Depending on your location, very busy work place, lots to keep you on your feet, easy to learn coffees and teas. Benefits were great and they even have a college plan for employers."
good,"This company was nice to be apart with because of the culture and growth but with just an OK salary. Whether you like coffee or not, you will learn methods and history on what are the business is all about. If you are interested in a fast paced work load then go."
good,"The learning curve if you know nothing about coffee is pretty steep but not impossible. The partners and the company try their best to set you up for success and you have to meet them halfway. Starbucks has very high standards for hygiene and food/beverage safety. "
good,"Starbucks has great benefits and I really like the people I work with. I am not getting any hours currently which hurts my financial state. I would recommend this as a job, but only if you're in school, have another job, etc."
good,"You will build a relationship with customers, and craft a solid skill in dealing with people. The hardest part of the job is fulfilling inventory and getting everything organized, in the busy rush hours of business. Most enjoyable part is the atmosphere and working with friends."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for 3 years. It really is a great place to work, with excellent benefits. My only issue is recently, my extremely abrasive and crass District Manager pushed everyone in my store to their limit and no one wants to come to work anymore because of the amount of pressure she puts on the management team. Starbucks also expects its stores to run as smoothly and efficiently as a McDonalds with less than half the people on the floor at all times. Its an extremely large work load and we're very rarely given enough people to tackle it."
good,"In a fast pace environment such as behind the bar, it is imperative to be able to handle a decent amount of pressure and also comfortably multitask. I quickly learned how to handle these myself while multitasking throughout my shifts. I also used my communication skills frequently when working as a team with my fellow baristas and shift supervisors."
good,everyday is always fun and engaging. team feels like a family and very good benefits and perks especially if you're a student. if you're in need of extra hours they also let you work at other locations.
good,Work could go one of two ways either really smooth or a total mess. If the partners are not the best then the job will be a lot more stressful. They care about their partners and that’s always a good sign
good,"Definitely an easy job that gives you a great intro into bartending, benefits are great. Only downside is unless you've worked there for a very long time then you won't get paid enough to cover your bills."
good,"Starbucks is high energy, great benefits, and high reward if you love customer service, enjoy creating experiences, and like routine/processes. Not everyone has a great manager or great coworkers, you have to find the right store and team for you. But once you do.. you're set!"
good,"Excelente lugar de trabajo, con Buenas prestaciones y un buen ambiente."
good,I loved working at Starbucks. The rushes of people would always allow me to communicate and sell our various specials and favorites to our customers. Starbucks helped me improve my customer service skills because the job is all about communication.
good,"O espírito Starbucks, eles trabalham com pessoas para pessoas."
good,"i enjoy working as a starbucks barista because the environment is friendly, work hours are flexible, we have tons of great benefits but limited PTO. i learned how to connect with customers and be more sociable. Management was wonderful and knowledgeable, workplace culture is fast-paced, positive and outgoing. Hardest part of the job is connecting with rude customers and making every moment right. The most enjoyable part is the moments you actually connect and engage with the customers and having an awesome team!"
good,During my time working as a partner with starbucks there was truly never a dull moment. Being apart of their company has built in my many skills especially since before my start date I had issues with personal to personal interaction. Also I had little experience in family situations and through Starbucks all inclusive partnership roles I have a better sense of belonging and better attitude now that i make sure to bring into any working environment.
good,"Fast paced"
good,Good place to work as a first job but is very fast paced and always on your feet. Long hours can be rough because it is so quick paced but it overall is a fun job and good place for emplyment
good,"After spending almost two years working at Starbucks, I was ready to move onto the next chapter of life. It is in large part a very quick paced and stressful job and you are expected to keep up. There is always something to do and something to clean. "
good,"Starbucks was one of my favorite places to work. I always enjoyed working there until we got a new store manager. The new manager was unprofessional with a bad attitude. She drove so many employees to quit which created a high turnover rate which in turn becomes really stressful for the employees. Aside from poor management, Starbucks offers great benefits and a great work environment for its employees."
good,"I do really enjoyed to worked in Starbucks, I love to make coffee and greeting many different customers. While I worked in Starbucks, I needed to taking orders from customers, collecting money from them, and made sure doing right orders for customers. Besides, I needed to managed the store is cleaned, and everything is fulled to service to customers. Every employees have their own parts to do, we were inter-worked. That is my favorite part of the job too, I loved to work with my co-workers."
good,A wonderful work environment i absolutely loved opening and helping customers with there drinks and food items. Making them smile and get to know more customer's on more then surface level.
good,"pretty high-paced environment, but supportive. if you feel like you do not fit in with a team, i suggest trying a transfer before completely quitting. there are ample opportunities to move up in the team and to be a leader as well as a team player.  its a great place to learn about coffee and service as well as make personal connections"
good,"I've been a Shift Manager for Starbucks for many years now. I work mornings during our Peak Period, and it is intense. If you love the challenge, like my team does, then you're good to go! If working in a fast paced environment where you're going to be challenged physically and mentally for hours at a time, Starbucks is not the place for you."
good,Very fast paced environment but with the proper management the work environment is a breeze. Customers and workers are usually very great and the drinks are continually changing with provides interesting changes and it doesn't get boring.
good,"Depending on what time of day you work, this job can be very fast paced and chaotic. Other times, it's very relaxed and you can focus on tasks instead of customers. "
good,"The only reason I left was for a financial need, I was 8 months pregnant and working 2 full time jobs, the other job I had paid more and I was planning for thee future. I still miss it, I made a lot of great friends and had a lot of good times."
good,"Common day at work was fast paced with fun, but hard working coworkers and managers.  Advantage is meeting a lot of new and nice people.  I was also working on my Masters degree while working for Starbucks and they were very good about flexibility with my schedule which changed every approximate 4 months."
good,"I loved this job! You get to work with some talented amazing people and provide high quality coffee to customers. People appreciate what you do and for some, their cup of coffee is the highlight of their day. It's nice making a difference in people's lives on a daily basis."
good,Starbucks is at times fast paced but can also be very relaxed work environment.  Mornings are obviously gonna be more busy but with drinks being the primary product being served you rarely ever feel overwhelmed.
good,"Great place to work at. However, my trainer lacked professionalism. He wanted to see me fail & honestly he just wanted a higher position and sucked up to the manager. He was not supportive or teach me anything, I did most of it myself. I had a friend that worked there and he helped me most of the time and he wasn't like my trainer."
good,"A normal day is making coffee for customers and serving them any food on the menu.  Talking with customers about their day and getting to know them."
good,Our branch have always been one of the top selling in the Philippines which require us to work twice as the other branches with a smile and a quality service. It was fun and tiring at the same time but the growth is high and the surroundings are very competitive.
good,A great place of works for a coffee lovers. A good ambience for a team workers. A knowledge of time table management. A perfect shift within a good co workers.
good,"A typical work day would involve coming in an being assigned to a position usually either as a barista or in support, the job isn't very hard but can be boring on slow hours and some of the shift supervisors are kind of annoying, my manager was great and really cared about the employees, plus the people were fun and easy to work with but they can improve on training and hygiene."
good,fun and responsible working environment .. need to have good communication skills and knowledge to explain the difference of the coffees and their taste
good,"A typical day at work would be fast paced but enjoyable. You love the work you are doing and the team works together which makes it very efficient. I learned how making a small human connection, even as you're handing someone their coffee, truly makes a world of a difference. I learned a lot about management and there was always opportunity to learn more about the culture of coffee and moving up in the company. It was competitive but when you love what you're doing, it made it easy. I can't say I really know what the hardest part of the job would be. The most enjoyable, was the job itself. I genuinely loved working there with all different kinds of people and making new connections and existing ones every day. Making coffee is fun and a true work of art. Overall a great place to work and grow."
good,"Most of the people I've met during my time with Starbucks have been great. At the end of the day, it's a team effort performing job duties and reaching your goal."
good,"Good work life balance for a retail store, great for college and HS students. Good job security and advancement training and opportunities. Awesome benefits and stock options plan"
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is usually a fast-paced to medium ratio of work. I learned how to handle cash, manage a cash register and provide friendly costumer service. Management at Starbucks is usually supportive and direct with reaching daily goals. All partners are welcoming and intuitive. The hardest part of the position is adjusting to early work times. The most enjoyable part of the job is serving costumers."
good,my typical day at work starts off when i clock in i start right away Starbucks is a very fast pace job and its never a down time so your always moving.
good,Mostly all the baristas at Starbucks are amazing people that help the work week to be enjoyable. Even through hard days and working holidays your coworkers become your close friends and family so it's not all that bad.
good,"Starbucks really cares about their partners and customers, however when trying to move up in the company it is difficult because there is such limited space. They offer great benefits & even free college education. They also offer paid educational business classes & leadership development."
good,"Every day will be different. Customers vary from day to day as does the amount of people coming through the door. Good customer service is essential. Speed, accuracy, and good manners are also key. Co-workers are ever changing but it is overall energetic and fun."
good,"el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno , se fomenta el trabajo en equipo , el personal tanto como baristas , supervisores y gerentes es muy bueno así como su trato humano .la capacitación es excelente "
good,"The job from the management side was get the work done. On the customer side, it was getting to know the customers. Enjoyable atmosphere with crew and customers."
good,It is a rewarding place to work with great experience being in a Mall of America location. There are no dull moments. The benefits are fantastic and the people you work with are great. The management is also a perk. If you are competent and dedicated then there is plenty of room for advancement and learning.
good,"I worked mainly opening the Starbucks cafe first by myself until more employees came in and working through the morning to early afternoon shifts. Everyone I worked with was amazing  and the management was great too. Everyone seemed to actually care about you and your well being and tried their best to give you the most current knowledge for your tasks. The only downside to working was I often got overwhelmed due to lack of enough employees, although it was rarely managements fault and more due to individual workers. "
good,"While working at Starbucks you are required to work in a fast paced environment, but also to make sure that every customer has a great experience. Although Starbucks may be viewed as an ordinary food service corporation, there is also a lot of behind the scene tasks many people aren't aware of. As a barista aside from making beverages, I was required to keep track of all inventory behind and in front of the store. You are also required to keep the store sanitary including the bathrooms, appliances, and  the furniture around the store. Starbucks as a company enforces a strong workplace environment that focuses on partner moral, this includes generous resources such as the C.U.P. fund which is a policy that allows partners to donate extra change to a fund that allows partners to access if there is a catastrophic event that happens to them, which I can't recall any other company doing for their employees. "
good,Overall working for Starbucks has been a rewarding experience. They push you to grow and learn new things. Connecting with customers is a wonderful experience to have every day. I have seen myself grow in many ways. I am surprised by my drive to push my own boundaries since starting with Starbucks. I feel more outgoing and more driven to find a career I truly am passionate about.
good,This is a great company to work for if you want to advance through the ranks. Starbucks treats all of it's employee's fairly and with respect. Would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Quick pased and definitely will keep you on your toes. Never a dull moment, always full of laughter and jokes. Team oriented, and an overall good time!"
good,It's fun to work at Starbucks and its something that once you learn its hard to forget. One of the best part parts is work with many different people and interacting with all the customers.
good,"Starbucks is a good place to work, the people you meet and work with are typically great people. I have made many friend that I wouldn't have met on my own. The environment can be stressful and it is definitely fast paced place speed is key when working there! I believe it can be fun working there with the right people!  the customers can be difficult to handle the are the hardest part of the job they are also the best part of the job! The culture of the store totally depends of the manager and their style of management get a good manager have a happy team of baristas."
good,I worked at a Starbucks inside a Target. I had a lot of fun. I started as a seasonal over the holidays. The intensity of the job at that time was so much fun.
good,"I've grown to be very customer orientated making strong connections with everyone who walk in. It has definitely made me to be more of an outgoing person considering the fact that I was shy when I first started. My store is extremely fast paced and stressful, but its all worth it when customers compliment on how fast and great the service was."
good,"As someone who worked for a Starbucks located in the airport, some days are challenging because of the fast paced nature of the airport. It is a rewarding experience as well for someone who loves coffee because you get to taste different kinds of coffee."
good,"It started as a temporary job but quickly became more than that. I was able to work my way from barista, to shift supervisor, to assistant manager, to store manager in 2 years and could have been less if it was my initial goal. The benefits and college achievement program are better than I could have asked for. Great company."
good,"Pros: Good benefits especially part-time. Pay for college. Investment into the company through a stock plan. Flexibility with shifts and work life balance. Great for college student and as a stepping stone. Instill a good work ethic. "
good,"This job is a lot of fun. However, I am pretty aware that there is a possibility that the fun and excitement in my job came with the people that worked there. This job isn't for everyone. I worked there over the summer between semesters and people were dropping out like flies."
good,"Una empresa con muy buem ambiente laboral, con facilidad de crecimiento, apoyo personal y buenas prestaciones"
good,"Starbucks was by far my favorite job. Job training is exceptional and  so is hiring. Starbucks seems to attract interesting and engaging employees in all locations, making their stores a great place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks. I got along with every coworker there, and we all supported each other. The benefits were amazing. The only reason I left was my availability changing when I went back to school, and had a full-time job on top of that."
good,Loved working here! The staff was great and became family. Can be a long term job and great oppotunities to move up. Everyone should work here once in their lives to gain expierence and teach you good customer service!
good,"Typical day working at Starbucks, you make coffee and satisfy customers. There will be that occasional customer on the edge because they don't have coffee yet but it's fun working there. It was interesting to see the different combinations customers made with their beverages. Hardest part of it was keeping up with the multiple orders but we made it through."
good,"great place to work, amazing benefits. Management could be better. most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet along the way. Whether that be your coworkers or customers."
good,Working at Starbucks allows me to create a personal relationship with regular customers while providing quality product. This job has allowed me to enhance my customer service skills.
good,"My co-workers and customers make my store the best for me to work at, you connect with all different types of people and it feels to be somebody's part of a daily routine."
good,"As fast as we bring in and say bye to customers, we gain friends quick. Networking is big at starbucks. I was lucky enough to meet customers that gave me some good insight about my major career choice."
good,"Started working at Starbucks after being overseas for a few years, and this job is though at times stressful, it's flexible within the hours, you're working with great coworkers, and you get to put a smile on people's face by feeding them coffee!"
good,"management  is perfect and professional, different shift and challenging, fun at work .opportunity to work with different nationalities. job is secured as its reputed company."
good,"It was a great place to work while being in school. They provided flexible hours. At the location I worked at they closed at 6, so being out of work by 7 was always perfect for going home and studying."
good,"The working experience varies greatly depending on which location you work at. My manager at Washington Square was great, so I had a better time than others."
good,You must be able to multi-task in a fast paced environment. Always working and smiling. You can come across rude customers but you need to make the best out of the situation.
good,"Starbucks goes above and beyond for their customers and employees, work is fun and goes by quick. Team structured and training very good. Free food and drinks."
good,"Starbucks as a company has an incredible and progressive culture. While the experience an individual has is highly dependent on the partners and management in the store, the company itself does a great job to ensure everybody is consistent and friendly. The only thing holding the company back is it's current drive to be as competitive as possible with other similar chains, resulting in a recently reduced payroll, increasing the stress load on current employees."
good,"A full shift at Starbucks for a barista was exhausting- you are constantly moving and multitasking. The ability to interact with customers and create relationships is amazing, though."
good,"starbucks is a high volume chain, during the ams, rushes are constant. A lot of benefits for starbucks partners. You are given an option of 401k, raises, free drinks on the shift and 1 free food."
good,"At Starbucks, rarely are the employees given a moment to breathe. Continuously scanning for things to do, such as restocking, cleaning surfaces, preparing products to make drinks, supporting co-workers with customer lines by grabbing food items and brewing fresh pots of coffee, we are constantly on the go. This pace teaches and encourages multitasking as well as prioritizing tasks. Those are both valuable skills learned as a barista at Starbucks. "
good,"A workplace that everyone cares with each other. A workplace were employee gives each other feedback, appreciation and most importantly words of encouragement. The best part of working at Starbucks is you work as team."
good,"it's like seeing all your best friends at work all day and even though you work it doesn't feel like work. The people make the job the best, so you go home feeling great."
good,"The day consisted of working and taking orders all day on your feet. The boss was very flexible, schedules, depending on the store can be flexible or set in stone. You have to work a minimum of 15 hours to be an employee."
good,This company is the best company where you can change your life. I've been working here 2 years and i gain so much knowledge and experience in this field. What I've learn is how u serve customer and how do you push more sales on this company.
good,"Great partners, flexible schedules, sense of teamwork and customer service are a big thing. Best part is: work always stays at the store, there's no need to take work home, ever."
good,"The company strives to do better. That doesn't always get carried out through its leaders though. The company has great benefits, but the pay is not competitive enough. It is a face paced environment with lots of constant ongoing feedback and communication."
good,Starbucks is a supporting and great company to work for. They give you a great choice of benefits. The management team also is great and hands on with the baristas.
good,"Overall it is a great place to work because of the benefits, but the company requires you to do a lot more then what you are paid for and upper management in town is all over the place."
good,"This job was a good transition from Chuck-E-Cheese because it allowed closer relationships with coworkers and customers, while working for a well amount of money. Starbucks has definitely been a good choice. Even on the hard days, I don't leave or wake up hating my job."
good,Starbucks is a relaxed work place with sometimes stressful customers but a relatively good job. The benefits are excellent and the co-workers are excellent.
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. It provides a great deal of experience for anyone that comes to work for the Siren. It gives amazing perks for all of the partners who work here, from a free pound of coffee every week to stock and 401K investments. The hardest part of the job is within training. Sometimes it can be a lot to take in, but once muscle memory takes over, it's cake."
good,"Working at Starbucks was an awesome experience. I learned a lot about customer service, communication skills, as well as money and inventory management. Most people I worked with came to work with a smile on their faces and also made sure customers come in and leave with smiles on their faces. The hardest part of the job would have to be being able to provide the right amount of inventory to make sure we have enough food and drink products without having too much waste. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the people I got to interact with. Both customers and coworkers were awesome to be around and it made the time at work go by very fast."
good,"Being a barista is the middle man between serving and preparing food. Overwhelming scenarios will always be present, just relax and remember ""It's just coffee"". Opening and Closing shifts are routine specific so of course starting off as a new employee you'll be bad at those, but with practice speed will follow. Management is dependent per store, but generally it's rare to find a supervisor or manager that genuinely practice what they preach."
good,Working at Starbucks as a Barista/Cashier was an amazing experience. I was able to add on more experiences in customer services and food services while there.
good,Starbucks will become like a second family to anyone that works there. They play on team building and cooperation and they make it easy to transfer locations. Overall a great place with good benefits and fun atmosphere.
good,"They have really cool benefits. Face pace work enviroment."
good," Greet customers, take and process orders in coffee shop database"
good,"One of the best place you can learn customer service skills."
good,"Starbucks mission is to nurture and inspire the human spirit, one cup, one person, one neighborhood at a time. "
good,"If a little more than minimum wage pays your bills, you won't find a better job."
good,"So a typical day working at Starbucks really comes to when your shift is. During day/morning shifts are really busy and hectic. "
good,My favorite position as a barista was being on the espresso machines making lattes and cold drinks. Also a good way to meet people and develop relationships within the community.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Starbucks. The benefits and salary is without equal. I loved my partners and my customers and had a blast every day. However, my manager made life difficult to say the least. She never seemed to care about us partners aside from how fast we could make drinks and would never take our side if a customer was being unreasonable. Despite this I still enjoyed my time at Starbucks until I inevitably could not work with my manager any longer."
good,Worked with several departments to follow Strategic Plan for new locations.  Included management and hourly training.  Spearhead to new training program development.
good,All in all a great job with amazing benefits just have to get lucky enough to have a good store manager. A very of open and accepting work environment.
good,"It's incredibly satisfying to step away from the bar at the end of a long shift and know you were killing it throughout a rough peak transaction period. Between that and the relationships you cultivate with your regulars and partners at the store, Starbucks really breeds a strong sense of community. When a store is well-staffed, well-stocked, and well-managed, it can be one of the most fun jobs in the world. That doesn't mean there aren't hard days-- demanding, inconsiderate customers, harried shift supervisors at the end of their rope, managers that can't keep ahead of the latest announcement from corporate of a new drink or deal or promotion. Still, I am glad I put time in to gain customer service experience and proud to have done it at Starbucks."
good,It's a great place to work with great benefits. It also depends who is running the store and your managers on the success of the store. One of the great things is that all starbucks follow the same standards so you can work at different starbucks to pick up shifts
good,Fast-paced team-oriented environment with plenty of room for growth. Great opportunity for a part time job. Fair compensation through benefits and discounts. Great opportunity to improve customer service and multi-tasking skills.
good,Outstanding culture and great place to work. Lots of room for growth and advancement for those willing to work hard and great the companies signature Third Place
good,"It's a good company with a good wage, good advancement and interactions with amazing people. Fantastic job if you enjoy Customer Service, a fast pace work environment and making meaningful connections with customers"
good,"This is a great company to work for. It teaches skills like cash handling, customer service, and organization. It is very fast paced and customer service focused."
good,Starbucks is very fast paced and it was a joy to work with the people on my team. Management was very involved and any issues were dealt with immediately.
good,"I loved being constantly busy & being abl to greet people at the beginning of the day to start their day but, i realized i got a little stressed out due to how busy my town was"
good,I  can learn how to have a good teams work experience in there and some of barista's skill.
good,"People are great. They become your family away from home. Great ways to grow in the company and as a person. They offer many benefits. Overall, great company to work for."
good,"I work as a part time barista at a Starbucks in Manhattan. I'm currently a college student, and the manager of the store has always been very kind to me and flexible with my hours. The job is not difficult and its rewarding if you enjoy interacting with people."
good,"Starbucks works with you and your personal schedule (if you are a barista). I have barely ever been turned down for time off. Benefits are countless from free food/drink to stock options, college tuition, etc."
good,"Starbucks puts a lot of effort into creating humanistic working environment- even for those who were seeking for part-time work."
good,"Great environment, enjoyable music, wonderful and helpful team. Decent pay. Come to work be prepared clock in be ready to work... flexible with hours."
good,I've only been working at Starbucks for a few months however I really like it. I have yet to have a serious altercation with any co worker or manager. There is however a lot of drama and back handed issues that happen. Other than that every things pretty good and it's a fun work environment. The only negative have is that the breaks need to be longer.
good,"One needs to be versatile in order to keep up with the busy and ever-changing duties that color the life of a Starbucks Barista. I used the cash machine, handcrafted personalized beverages, cleaned the store, and aided the clientele in their Starbucks experience. As a barista, I also found it necessary to keep my knowledge of the new product up-to-date. The best thing about Starbucks is the ability to individually care for people, The quality of the job really depends on the quality of the manager. I have worked at amazing Starabucks, and really crummy Starbucks But this is true for all jobs. Starbucks is, on the whole, a great company to work for."
good,"Starbucks offers training of all their beverages through online and hands on training. Clear and instructive!"
good,"As a barista at Starbucks, a typical day included taking customer's drink and food orders, making beverages, and cleaning various areas such as seating and table areas, coffee machines, and bathrooms. I also did various random tasks like brew coffee and prep drink ingredients. I work part-time while also going to school and my manager has been very accommodating with my busy schedule. I've learned many skills while working at Starbucks like working high-stress situations, productivity, and time-management skills. The culture at Starbucks is very diverse. We have several regular customers while also getting new customers everyday. The staff is also diverse with staff member's ages ranging from 16-50. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to interact with the regular and new customers everyday, and getting to make their day a little better by simply making their favorite drink. The hardest part of my job is that it's very stressful when it's busy and it's hard to get the amount of hours that I would like."
good,"Most enjoyable part of this job is the people you work with and customer interactions, you begin to build deep relationships with your regular customers and it feels more like a family than a job. Management is usually amazing, but you have to be able to adapt to your area and what kind of work flow is needed. a fast ever changing environment but so much fun."
good,"Good company, fun place to work. Flexible with hours. Good benefits. Fast paced job with Lots of room for growth. Overall a very good company to work for."
good,"When I started Starbucks took pride in their baristas. When I ended my time, it was very much about the bottom line. Working late or being short staffed made you work harder for your fellow coworkers, not because you would be rewarded from the company."
good,I love Starbucks as a company and it's directions in the world for achieving a sustainable future. The people are always understanding if you know what it means to struggle and still keep a smile on your face.
good,The coffee is amazing.Once your used to Starbucks other companies so different. The partners are the best they are all like a family. You get a taste if home with each visit.
good,"Starbucks is devoted to ensure quality customer service. This is determined by the expertise level in your barista. Not all Starbucks will give you the same level of customer service, but you will be able to tell which locations are more well rounded than others."
good,"In the workplace I performed several duties and provide several duties. I take orders and make coffee, tea, and other drinks to customer specifications.  I also operate cash registers and credit card machines. Sometimes, I encounter customer complaints or questions, as well. "
good,Starbucks was a good introduction to the intense coffee culture around the world. I changed locations half way through my Starbucks career in hopes of getting more hours at work. Each location I had an amazing team to work with (which is really important) and a solid management team to back me up.
good,"I've worked for this company and followed my manager to a new location. She is excellent and has always been there for me. She's there to make sure all of her employee's succeed. It can be fast paced when we get a rush of customers. All of the baristas work together and stay in position and everything goes smooth. I enjoy meeting new people, as well as seeing all of the regulars that come in and spend time in our lobby."
good,"if you are young and in school/college. this place is for you. they have locations every where. you can advance to shift supervisor, assistant manager, and manager if you wanted to. they train you very well. you have fun on a daily basis."
good,Starbucks was such a fun work environment. The work was fast paced but making drinks and coffe was fun to me. My co workers were very invested in being a team and helping eachother. They put me in for the exact hours I wanted. They were also understanding when complications came up in my personal life.
good,great company. excellent management. admirable culture. hard work. awesome benefits. good salary for management. lots of opportunities for advancement.
good,"Starbucks is a very fun place to work, you meet unforgettable customers and build lifelong friendships with fellow partners. There is a sense of passion from almost everyone you work with about their job. You get to alternate role positions every shift and the hours are relatively flexible. The manager I worked under was very hands off and did not help me move up in my role when I expressed an interest and passion early on. There was a lot of employee turnover with transfers and no shows. The pay was under compensating for the amount of work baristas do rather than shift supervisors. I met some of my closest friends here and enjoyed learning more about the company and the culture of the product. The hardest part of the job were the job duties expected of baristas while being short staffed during a rush. The most enjoyable parts were the people, the customers, the art of making drinks, and taking pride in your store."
good,"I recently moved from a small town outside of Twin Falls, Idaho. The transition has been great due to the people I have met from working here. The management here is awesome and is very understanding and great to work with."
good,Getting used to the flow of things is hard at first but once you get used to how crafting drinks works it becomes pretty exciting and interacting with customers and helping them figure out what they like and seeing the enjoyment on their faces when they get the drink and they love it is priceless. You meet a lot of great people
good,"As a manager it is a bit stressful to work but the benefits and regular customers are worth the work. There were days where we were extremely busy and slightly understaffed, but being able to keep up morale and continue forward made it okay."
good,"Starbucks is a job often thought of as just a liaison between college job to career.  However, in my experience there, I can truly say that I have greatly solidified my communication, management, and customer service skills."
good,Otima empresa otima conduta maravilhoso ambiente de trabalho.
good,The culture of Starbucks is one of the best I have seen in retail. Lots of room for advancement and lots of resources for development. They really empower their managers to think outside of the box and run their business.
good,The most enjoyable part about my job is giving the customer their preferred drink of the day and seeing that smile when they take the first sip. It is a very enjoyable moment for me.
good,"Love working here, everything is great except the lack of hours and how difficult it is to advance. Weekly coffee markout and daily drink and food mark outs are huge plus."
good,"Working at Starbucks is much more than just pouring coffee for customers. Much of the management work was passed on to supervisors, such as myself. I was responsible for reducing or increasing labor staff in order to meet business needs, inventory management and reconciliation, and setting realistic goals for the team. Being a successful partner at Starbucks requires being able to successfully balance work productivity and building relationships with customers. Connecting with customers is part of the Starbucks culture; this guarantees a higher clientele return and greater return on profit for our store and the company."
good,"Working in a small area with at least 6 other coworkers can be a little stressful, however, the environment is fun and easy to work around. the flow of the store stays consistent. regular costumers are a joy to see and talk to. Great way to meet people."
good,"Atmosphere is very upbeat. Always super busy, fast pace, and uses slot of problem solving skills. Friendly baristas even at other stores worked. Difficult scheduling for flexibility is a limited. Customers are mostly friendly. Always learning to improve skills and giving tips to other employees."
good,Great opportunity and a fun experience To better your patients and working closely with customers and the community many different ethnicity's and over the Top personalities .Many opportunities to further your education and career later in the future rather its three to six months or even a year to three years it was a great stepping stone .
good,"typical work day is about 8 hours and I pull pastries, count items, and make sure people are taking their breaks. I've learned how to become a leader and how to manage my time, The culture at Starbucks is very high paced and social. I love talking to customers and getting to know the regulars, and I look forward to seeing them when I work. "
good,I think that Hms host is a great place to work because of advancement opportunities and flexibility. I appreciate being in a union and having the option to travel to a different state with job stability.
good,"A typical day for me would begin very early in the morning opening the store.  I would be in charge of counting tills and making sure coffee, tea's and espresso bars were set up and ready for the day.  I would also have to check in daily milk and food order, as well as making sure that I did the order for the day I opened.  The workplace culture was very welcoming and it felt like you were apart of a family."
good,Everyday is an opportunity to provide outstanding service and represent a world-class brand.  I strive to ensure our customers have an experience that leaves them feeling welcome and appreciated which in turn has allowed our business to grow and prosper even in tough times.
good,"Great job for young adults to learn about the workforce firsthand. There are great benefits, best of all free college through ASU. Demands from corporate to reach sales goal seem misguided at times and contrary to Starbucks' mission. To inspire and nurture the human spirit one person, cup, and neighborhood at time."
good,"Fast paced environment given the opportunity to learn how to multi-task and interact with new people and different cultures. Hardest part of the job would be keeping up with store peek period. Overall, great place to work with full benefits available to part- time workers."
good,"It was a good job, hours went by fast if we were busy. I learned how to: communicate to all different kinds of personalities, how to work with people, be a team player, developed great customer service, and i learned how to be efficient and effective when working to accomplish more in a small amount of time. My manager was amazing and very good at his job. He made it very easy to work there. Hardest part of the job was the long hours on your feet, but it wasn't unbearable. My co-workers and customer were by far the best part of that job. I love connecting with customers and putting a smile on their faces."
good,The best part of working at starbucks was interacting with each customer. It was not only about serving but engaging in a conversation as well. That not only changed the customers mood but the atmosphere as well.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. Benefits are great along with great perks. Wished the hours were more consistent, especially during the slow seasons. Met some amazing partners as well as customers during my 4 years."
good,"It was a warm inviting, friendly atmosphere, very active during most of the day but coworkers made it remarkably enjoyable so the day flies by.The job was productive and most importantly it was flexible."
good,"ambiente respetuoso, flexible y entretenido. Mi estadía en este trabajo fue grato puesto que el ambiente era propicio y también la relación entre jefe y trabajador era positiva"
good,"I love coffee and it was never a dull day with my coworkers!  The culture developed in a coffee house is one of warmth, welcoming, and friendly.  The only hard part of the job was learning where each of the bazillion buttons on the register was."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of making coffee, preparing food, cleaning up the store, and putting away any inventory. Throughout my time working for Starbucks, I developed my customer service skills, and learnt how to work under stressful situations. The management at Starbucks was great. They were very understanding, and were great teachers. The workplace was fun and full of excitement. The hardest part of the job was trying to make multiple drinks at once. The most enjoyable part was seeing a smile on every customer's face after receiving their delicious drinks."
good,I love the energy and individuality you find at Starbucks. The health benefits are great. I enjoy being able to follow my passion for coffee and bring quality beverages to the community. I love how my coworkers become friends to me. We are able to be ourselves while being productive.
good,"Starbucks is great first job for anyone, very flexible hours, management is good, and benefits are amazing. Including 401, perks, discounts daily, and mark-outs weekly, and much much more. Starbucks has taken care of me for the last 5 years, and I couldn't ask  for more."
good,Starbucks was a very reliable company to work for. Willing to promote form within. System is clear and easy to learn. Thoughtful employees and team environment.
good,Worked all positions in the store. Reviewed company supplied reports and with insights from store partners and customers created and executed business plans to drive sales. Hired and trained store partners. Great company to work for with a lot of benefits that go beyond pay.
good,You are expected to deliver world class service everyday. Your job is to satisfy. Starbucks has great benefits and they take care of their partners. It will become your extended family. The most challenging part of being in management is meeting your goals but overall it is possible. Thankful for my opportunity.
good,"its an awesome place full of energy!!!"
good,"I worked my way up to management starting as a barista. The job as a barista is physically demanding, having to be at work very early and being required to multi task production of food/beverage, interaction with customers, and keeping a clean environment. I, personally, am a morning person and enjoy working in a fast paced environment and making relationships with regular customers. "
good,"Always on the move preparing drinks, organizing, and helping customers at the cash register. Never a dull moment at Starbucks, and the people who I worked with were very cooperative and polite."
good,"It truly depends on the store you work at as far as what Starbucks is like. Some managers are amazing, some are not. However, the benefits are great and if you have the ability to see through the negative aspects and look at the positive you should do alright. The hardest part is the cutting of the hours when bills need to be paid and there is no money to pay them with"
good,"This job was a fun, fast paced and exciting environment to work in but unfortunately the wage was very low. Regardless of that, it was enjoyable with nice management. Very good for a first job experience."
good,Bon métier où l'on peut évoluer facilement mais j'avais besoin de changer de métier pour aller plus dans le conseil que la vente
good,"I loved my time with Starbucks. I always had caring managers who were committed to the quality and culture of the company. I received regular updates about my performance and developed many skills because of my manager's persistent support. "
good,"Great place to work, lots of fun. The hardest parts were difficult customers but the rest was good. I learned a lot about coffee and have grown to love it more than I thought I would. I also learned problem solving, working under pressure, and working in a team."
good,"Starbucks is a great resume building job. I've learned many essential skills including cash management, training and social skills that have served as my foundation for professional success. "
good,"It was a pretty good job. Management sucked. Scheduling was pretty flexible, and the part i loved most about the job was the employees. It was very versatile and you got to work with a variety of different people."
good,Convenient place to work for students (this location was third party under Aramark on the University of Mississippi campus)
good,"Management is great and understanding of what you need. "
good,"Busy working environment however it is a fun working environment as all the partners are very helpful and cheerful. I have learned a lot from this particular job placement including teamwork, time management, people skill and responsibility. The management has done a good job in making make sure the store is doing great and compelling to the company's target each day and month. The hardest part of the job is definitely dealing with difficult customers but it is quite a privilege having to deal with different types of customers as it helps me to grow as a service worker and as a person. The most enjoyable part of the job is able to meet a lot of people from different part of the world."
good,Good place to work! Lots of opportunities to grow and great job culture. Fast paced environment caused lots of laughs and fun challenges
good,"This job is good and starbucks one of the famous cafe in the world.but for my problem ,my manager is irritating and always favor her close partner .me and another one partner who youngest there always have to do everything.and we always have to do closing shift .seniority and favorism too much."
good,"The typical day at work was very busy. Being I did not work in a stand alone Starbucks, Target shoppers were in and out. Management there wasn't the best. My co-workers were amazing individuals. The hardest part of the job was in the beginning, I was closing the store by myself. Management did not correctly teach me how to close the store. I left because of College, family, and the management."
good,"Starbucks was a fun place to work for, if not a bit high stress. Many customers can be very picky and needy but if you balance their needs and wants and focus on the job, you'll do just fine."
good,"A typical day at work after working there for awhile would be greeting not only your co-workers but the customers. Most customers are your regulars and you get to learn about them and who they are. You learn not only what your job is about or what you have to do, but that it's more than just a coffee shop, it's your family. Management was very understanding, but sometimes forgetful... Like when you ask a question about your benefits and they say, ""I call you in five minutes"", but they leave to go home. Co-workers at Starbucks were pretty much friendly, but some can be in their late twenties and act like they're fifteen. Sometimes the coworkers buddy up, but that's almost like all jobs. The hardest part of the job was to simply be noticed. What I mean is, pursuing to be a shift supervisor when you're not really anyone to management. Most of the supervisors were obviously close to management that made everybody else, a nobody or fit for the lead. However, the best part of the job; was just working there and being a barista. I didn't work there because I had to, but because I wanted to make customers happy. I personally had a connection with customers and loved what I did."
good,Very fast paced job with up beat employees looking to have a great day. Starbucks gives so many benefits that add to the value of being an employee. As for advancement there is so much competition to move up that it takes some time which can be discouraging. The hardest part of the job is usually being short staffed during a rush. Everyone runs around angry because the customers don't understand that it takes time to make hand crafted beverages even when its busy. Pro: customers who understand and can see how hard we work every day and still manage to smile.
good,"Downtown Petaluma is a fairly slow spot for a Starbucks, but that doesnt keep it from getting busy. Starbucks is a great starter job, and makes it very easy to move up in the business if you retain what you learn. I personally have taken some interesting life lessons about myself on the job. The management I feel could use some work at times, but really they have things down. You always feel supported by your leaders in the job. As for my partners, I have had some of the COOLEST and most spunky beautiful characters for my co-workers anywhere. I love connecting with the customers and really just creating a safe and homey environment. I'd have to say the hardest part of the job is really just when it gets fast paced, trying to keep up with tasks during a daily rush is a challenge. But it keeps it fun too."
good,"In my experience, managenent is great but I do wish there were more hours granted to workers under 18, because I'm going to be in college at age 17 and I dont think its fair that I have to survive off of 12 hours a week."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed working at this company. There were many benefits such as a 401k plan, health insurance and discounts for the employees."
good,"Need to multi task "
good,this job is honestly my best job so far. the benefits and the air of community in the store is admirable.  i would reccomend it to anyone looking for something that would benefit int he long run
good,Starbucks have a lot of great employees. I enjoyed working with the customers a lot the regulars that came in made always made my day! I learned a lot about team work and working hard under pressure but being able to maintain a great work enviroment
good,"Working at Starbucks was very peaceful and exciting. Getting to know my customers on a friend-to-friend type of level, being able to make people smile everyday, working hard but happy while doing so, and to get to learn more about the different types and taste of the coffee's they sale so that i have the knowledge to give to an unsure customer."
good,"Depending on the store you choose, you typically have a wonderful experience working here. It is very fast paced and you must pay attention to detail. The co-workers are the best, and since you can work at any Starbucks once you've been with the company for 6 months, you make plenty of friends. Management is for the most part wonderful, although I will say the management in Blue Springs is disappointing. I loved the customers, they were always so kind and  became family after a while. The hardest part of the job is probably when you are short staffed because there is a specific operation that requires a team and if you are missing the people you need for a rush, you are in for a rough day."
good,"A typical day at work consists of ringing up customer's orders, preparing drinks, and maintaining the cleanliness of the store. I learned how to efficiently multitask."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. The culture is like no other. Working alongside some of the best managers is truly rewarding. The Total Pay package is very competitive.
good,"Easy to manage with school or other jobs, easy to get time off and benefits with only 20 hours a week minimum. Friendly environment. At times can be stressful and co workers no call no show frequently."
good,"Wonderful company to work for. If you work hard, they'll work hard to take care of you. Incredible benefit packages for full-time and part-time employees."
good,"Starbucks is a company that is evidently successful in aligning their vision and goals with their strategies. As a barista at starbucks, I was always encouraged to develop strong customer connections and do our best to provide them with the best service possible."
good,Working at Starbucks can be an extremely rewarding experience. It teaches patience and also teaches teamwork in the workplace. The most enjoyable aspect is working with your coworkers. You're constantly around one another and it leads to comradery. The only negative is the scheduling the higher ups pushed towards the managers lead to poor work conditions at times. The benefits are A+!
good,Great activities and learning experiences. I was lucky to work with a great team of co-workers. Making specialty drinks and latte art had to be the best part of the job. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the 8 min cleaning and replenishing cycle through out the day at a face pace location. Great place to learn about the history of where and how their coffee products come about.
good,"A typical day consisted with me starting my shift at the oven, then when more orders came on the cold bar I would take over the cold bar and manage the oven at the same time."
good,"It is a demanding job that depend on a person capability to remain focus for long period of time, and to be able of multitasking. It demands retails skills.  A barista must be able of making delicious customize beverage for customers."
good,"Usualy i would start off  b chaging out all expired products. Ensuring that all our products are fresh and ready for use. Then after, Is what  we call  a prep cleanning of the entire store. Open up a cash reagister, Brewing of coffee /making drinks, and taking out packaged sanwitches made  eatable to the customer. We have a very fast paced  working enviroment,where your constantly on your toes and moving around alot."
good,Providing excellent service to the customers and train to the new employees . Making the schedules and follow the starbucks procedure and new promotion.
good,"Working at starbucks has forced me to open up and improve my people skills. We meet people everyday and also build relationships with our regulars. I'm very insecure and sometimes find myself very antisocial, but after working at starbucks, I've learned to communicate with others easily. I'm very glad to have found this job because it has help me greatly. Now a days I can talk to anyone and not feel uncomfortable."
good,Great place to work if you are in school or have trouble with babysitters for the kids. They have an excellent work schedule very suitable for you. Great place to meet a variety of people and excellent way to build customer service skill and work on your memory skills.
good,A typical day at Starbucks is making sure everything is restocked and clean before the afternoon rush. I learned how to make certain beverages during the rush hour and perfected each one. The management at Starbucks is good. They maintain high standards. The manager is very friendly and approachable. My co workers are helpful and polite as well as being attentive. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with rush once i started but as time went by i got more proficient at it. The most enjoyable part of the job is making new beverages and the obvious...getting free coffee.
good,"Enjoyable, and fun! Co-workers allowed for an easy and fulfilling workday, solidifying that teamwork in a workplace, gives a smooth ride."
good,Some days at work it could be very stressful and for some it affected on their outside life. You learn a lot and have to memorize it all . The hardest part of the job is dealing with the rude customers you get that just ask for extra stuff just do make you mad. You get along with your co-workers very well you usually make a bond with eachother.Great enviornment
good,"Los partners de todo starbucks eran bien sociables por eso el ambiente laboral que se respiraba era bueno, un dia comun era atender a los clientes en caja y preparales sus bebidas"
good,My supervisor was great and taught me a lot especially in dealing with customer orders. Making coffee was fun.
good,Love my job as a barista. Worked there to put myself through school. My co workers and supervisors are supportive of me and very flexible with my schedule. Great atmosphere to be in.
good,"Starbucks is an awesome company to work for! They offer LOTS of benefits from health for part-time workers to free tuition at ASU online. Pay is currently minimum wage, but with all the discounts received it works out pretty nicely!"
good,"Llegar con un buen humor por las mañanas y otorgarles una sonrisa a los clientes que requieran de un cafesito caliente, tener cada día fijas las metas tanto de la empresa como  personal. Tener mut buena aptitud y actitud."
good,I worked at starbucks for 6 months and then found a new job 8 months later I am working at starbucks once again! Working at starbucks there's always something to do and it's always busy. It's very fast-paced and fun to work in. The only thing that sucks is working holidays but you usually get to choose which holiday you want to work and if you want to work it during the day or night
good,Must be a quick learner and very attentive to detail when working with Starbucks. I loved this job and it was a very great opportunity.
good,"Spent late high school and all of college working at starbucks and its essentially the perfect place for a student to work. Flexible hours, tips, access to coffee, etc. After being employed for long enough they offer tuition reimbursement, stock options, and full medical benefits."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consists of several things that begin immediately once you clock in. The shift manager would assign where you will be working at and eventually rotate employees as your shift progresses. I usually was on bar and made drinks for both bar and drive thru. If I wasn't working on bar, I usually was working on DTO for drive thru and taking orders and communicating with customers. Some things I learned while working with Starbucks are that people are capable of being extremely picky with what they order and your coworkers can snap at you a few times, especially working the early morning shifts. However, I also learned that the job is very routinely and fast-paced and something that you either grasp onto quickly or learn very slowly, which is OK because everyone learns differently. Management was good, my manager was very friendly and was known as a friend as well as a manager. The only thing about management, is that they do not necessarily follow your availability that you request for, which can cause a lot of issues. I had that issue quite often, but it is also expected sometimes when you are short staffed. My manager did great though, as our previous manager was on leave and we were left scrambling for a short amount of time. My co-workers were amazing, some young, some older, but I loved a lot of them and built great relationships with some of them quickly. The hardest part of the job for myself in particular was the hours, mainly because they would always schedule me super early morning shifts (against what my availability stated) and that was something"
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. I learned how to make drinks and to keep a smile on the customer face.  The co-workers are easy to work with and help make the job go by easy. The hardest part of the job is to tell the customers were out of something and to keep a smile on my face when they are mad and going off on me. The most enjoyable part of my day at Starbucks is to see the smile on the customers face, and to know that you put it there."
good,"Starbucks is a place to work if you are fast paced and enjoy interactions with customers. The best part of the job is handling coffee and being able to make things run smoothly, theres nothing better than having a day at work where everything is prepared, no slip ups, every machine is working, and all the co-workers are in a good mood. The hardest part of the job would be busy days where all you have time for is making drink after drink, not being able to look up from your station, and then dealing with angry customers because they have been waiting for so long due to the business of the store. I learned patience, and I learned what hard work is, because working at a Starbucks in a busy mall is definitely a lot of labor."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to talk with customers and getting to meet new people from many different places."
good,"I currently work at this Starbucks. It is fun and fast paced. It is one of the busiest Starbucks stores in the state of Colorado. It can be challenging at times, but everyone works as a team to the job done."
good,On a daily basis you're greeted with friendly people in a friendly environment with people who have a love for coffee as strong as yours.
good,"This was a really fun and rewarding job, i was able to work around my college and university schedule. I was always learning new things in this job."
good,"Its a good work place for a beginning worker, but its not for people who can't handle the pressure of the job. The hardest part of the job is being under pressure for a consistent amount of time and not being able to take a break when you feel tired."
good,"While the job itself can be stressful, working at starbucks isn't a bad place to be. I really enjoy talking to customers and establishing those relationships."
good,es un lugar super agradable solamente que los cierres de turno son un poco pesados
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for. A typical day is very busy at certain locations & at times nonstop. I've learned that I have become very knowledgable at a much faster pace and i am able to teach others more than what i used to be able to do. I still am able to interact with customers very well and put smiles on their face even with a brief interaction. Management is great and my co workers are enjoyable as well. The hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule at times.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks always starts in a hurry you rush in to find out who's spot you will be taking and you begin your daily routine. I'm usually on bar, because i can keep up and multitask... the thing about working at a coffee shop is you get use to meeting all kinds of people all day long plus you have some of your favorite regulars there. The one thing that is amazing about Starbucks is the way all of us coworkers come together to make sure everything is moving correctly , team work is BIG at Starbucks. The hardest part about Starbucks would have to be dealing with angry customers but at the end of the day it is all ok my job is just to calm them down and do what it takes to bring them to a happy place. my all time favorite part about this job is my coworkers they have become my family the ones i turn to for advice and comfort..."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for if you are a student or you need a part time job. They are pretty flexible with the scheduling and you get free meals and drinks on the day you work. 30% on days you are not working, which is still a lot. They offer benefits if you work a certain amount of hours and free tuition for students if you qualify."
good,"Quite out going, you get to meet people from all over the Untied States and countries. The other day I met someone from Seattle Washington. You get to talk and connect with all your loyal and foreign customers in the process of enjoying your job. What I find the most difficult at work is only waking up so early to open the store at five in the morning. All my co-workers are very friendly and relaxed. We all help one another good and bad times. I did learn how to keep up with a fast paced work environment. I learned about new cultures, for instance, what one drink is called in one city and another name in another state. Making drinks, connecting with my customers and learning about my job. where coffee beans come from, how they are made and taste better with certain pastries/ foods was most enjoyable about my job. Overall a fantastic work place to socialize, talk to new people and a good part-time job to make some extra cash."
good,This has been my first job and i thoroughly enjoyed working here and with my co-workers as it was a very happy working environment. The management in this work place is run very well. As it is a very busy store there will be days where the 8 hours shifts would fly by and be continuous. Being in this job has helped me learn to handle any situation in calm and appropriate manner as well as giving me a list of new knowledge and skills.
good,Free Coffee what more can a hard working college student ask for? Plus there is always a chance for advancement and if you work enough hours that you can afford it they have great health benefits and 401k options
good,"I typical day consisted of managing shift employees.  I did the inventory and place orders.  I trained new employees. Kept the store organized, clean and well stock."
good,"This company is great at providing schedule/location flexibility, as well as provides outstanding training and resources for customer service. They really pride in providing not just excellent customer service, but also employee experience. The benefits are easily attainable, and the opportunities to help in the community, or move up in the company are very accessible as well."
good,"Working at Starbucks is hectic, but its also fun. You interact with hundreds of new people per day & you never work the same day twice."
good,"A company that takes care of it employees and consistently works towards a better service for it clientele, focusing on the costumer service."
good,"Starbucks is a great company that teaches paramount customer service and numerous benefits for employees, both short and long-timers. However, the demand on customer service and patience is extraordinarily strenuous by comparison to what the company offers wage-wise until one reaches general management level."
good,"make baverage, handle food, engage and get to know customers, friendly partners, some customers can be cranky but its fine"
good,Its a wonderful place to work at. The people and management is great. The customers are usually good people. It's a easy life working at Starbucks. Its only flaw is that it's a lower paying job at first.
good,Enjoy working with the partners at the Gold River Starbucks and being able to interact with our customers. Store and district manager are great to work for and care about their people.
good,"I love my job at Starbucks. I always have fun working in a team. The store I work in, is one of the ones with the most sales, and also is part of the Evenings program, which allows us to sell craft beer, wine, and a new variety of appetizers."
good,"I worked at a drive thru store.  A typical day was busy, busy, busy."
good,"I LOVED working at Starbucks, enjoyed the fast pace and coworkers as well as the interaction with Customers. The Benefits make this job worth it and I so enjoyed the experience of learning more about Coffee and Espresso and how to craft delicious and beautiful beverages!"
good,fast paced environment is something to get used to. Its important that if you get this job you are a team player. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with other partners and seeing the nice regulars.
good,"It was a fun place to work at. You learn so much about coffee that you would've never thought of, and the benefits are great."
good,"Overall for a first real full-time job it is a brilliant experience, Especially for someone with a bubbly personality and eager to try something new. Management and head office are great and always happy to help."
good,"Make Hand Crafted Specialty for customers. Fun and fasted paced. The job is as enjoyable as you make it to be. Must be customer oriented, patient, and possess the stamina to keep up with the business."
good,"Formacion Profesional en base a la atencion al cliente de una forma personalizada, gestion de stock, liderazgo, compañerismo"
good,"Everyday was a new adventures. Making drinks, work drive-thru, front register, and daily cleaning tasks is a typical day. I learned how important team work is in this business. The management and coworkers always had a  good attitude. the hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult situations."
good,Everyday at work is a new adventure with awesome management and supportive co-workers. We tend to any customers needs while keeping a clean work place. Greeting customers before they reach the register to ensure they feel welcome in the Starbucks environment is key. Our goal everyday is for our customers to leave our store with a bright smile.
good,"Typically, Starbucks is a very high energy, fast placed place to work. Each job station is assigned by the shift lead and there is a routine to each station to ensure speed and quality. Starbucks is a very efficient place to work so that the customer is satisfied and there isn't a lot of wasted time or energy. The management is well organized and set up to succeed. The hardest part of the job, for me, is the lack of interaction during the busiest parts of the day. It is very stressful and customer interaction is minimal. The most enjoyable part about Starbucks is environment. While it isn't as relaxed as smaller coffee shops, I do enjoy the type of environment and interaction with customers that Starbucks has to offer."
good,My experience at Starbucks has been both challenging and beneficial. I have enjoyed my time working for this company and they have helped my advance in my goals for my life. The management is encouraging and they care about my growth and my health. Every day was a new experience.
good,"I learned how to work in an organized manner. I found great companies aren't build in a day, it takes lot of time and excellence in work to be who they are."
good,"Great opportunity to develop from Barista to Store Manager. Very good benefits, especially for hourly partners. Hours aren't always family friendly, but that is to be expected in retail/food service."
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Starbuck's is preparing the drinks. There are a lot of recipes to remember but once you get the basic models down pact its very simple. The customers are very polite. Management goes above of beyond to make sure barista are treated how they should be treated.
good,"This is a easy job to have while going to college full time. I like that i can get 35 hours in a week and still have them work around my school schedule so i still have time to do homework. I really enjoy everyone i work with, and when there is hardly any space behind the counter, you get pretty close. So its good to like who you are working with"
good,"This is an AMAZING company to work for with values I am proud to stand by. Their benefits package is outstanding and overall upper management is on point. However a home life is pretty much non existent, especially if you have a family."
good,"Starbucks consists of the staff, the management and the customers. You will be lucky to get two of them to be encouraging. The staff is part-time employees pushed to improve every day at a job they typically don't want to be at. The management is expected to push that staff to new heights and will either exceed expectations or crumble under the pressure. The customers are usually in a rush and have been known to take out their frustrations on who ever is in front of them. When the stars align, and all three have positive attitudes, its one of the best part-time jobs I've ever seen."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks only consists of clocking in and out and performing job tasks. The customers are all different people, who may or may not know what they want."
good,"You can pick up extra shifts and the company works hard to communicate changes and benefits to employees. Morning shifts can start pretty early, but it is a coffee shop so you have every resource at your disposal to wake up and wake up right!"
good,Very fast paced in the mornings hardly any down time which is what I love the most. I learn something new everyday my knowledge on the company is sharpened everyday. The management is very respectable and they work with your schedule as well as any other needs you may have. my co workers are team players and the communication is the key for us to get the job done sufficiently and effectively. the hardest part is the best and most enjoyable part of my job which is learning and advancing in every function on my job.
good,Highly ethical working place were in helps you to become a better person and a better employee as you carry the brand name and being a part of it is such a big honor you are able to maximize and discover all the skills that you are able to show on a daily basis.
good,"Great company to work for with great benefit package and treating employees so well."
good,It has its perks as well as its flaws. It definirely depends on your location and who is running the store. But overall they have great benefits even for part timers and it easy to move up in management.The job is secure for pretty much any state you wanna travel to and they are considerate of life outside of work. Overall a good company to work for
good,"Its great working to a company that you know that you are secured that you are being taking cared of and that is what M.H Alshaya has done for me and for the 40,000 of my colleagues. Starbucks is just one of the brands that the company is running, and I am one of the thousands that are lucky enough to be part of the team, In my store which is located at the Dubai Mall, it is typical to have a busy shift everyday specially week ends,it is been said that we have the most number of guest and sales throughout the country. But we do manage ta take are of them even with few number of partners at our disposal, Managers and shift leads are usually seen working on the line with us, which is great feeling for us Barista's knowing that your leaders are with you all the way no matter what the situation would be."
good,"Starbucks is great to work for. I used to work at Grand Central Station, high volume and very fast paced. Making drinks is something I still love to do, even as a customer I like to make drinks that aren't on the menu to satisfy my taste buds. This is a great job for college students because the hours are very flexible and starbucks has a college program. This is also a great place to work that promises advancement to those who really show passion and work for it. Co-workers come and go due to school, availability, and advancement but everyone has a good time together. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the regulars who are happy to see you just as much as you are happy to see them."
good,"I appreciated Starbucks as a company. The work environment was fun and fast paced, and hours were flexible. However, I felt that there could have been better management. I felt there was a lot of unprofessionalism within the management at my store."
good,"Management is very intense. Also, the co-workers are intense. When things are slammed ever it gets stressful. Otherwise everyone is really great."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. They have tons of benefits that will help you through healthcare and schooling
good,"Working with others and meeting others is great! Its tough learning all the drinks. But once you get into it, youre golden."
good,I loved my job at starbucks! Great place to work they have great employee benefits and you never stop learning new things!
good,"I would work vary of shifs mostly 8:30AM-5:00PM. I had managed a team as big as 30. I did payroll, training, inventory, scheduling, meetings, launch sets with my Shift Supervisors. I had 4 Shift supervisors that made sure the night and early morning task were complete before our first rush at 6AM. My co-works acted as if everyone was family, it was a warm and inviting place to work. Management was great until salary cuts were done to keep growth within the company. I took a 10% pay cut to make sure all my employees had a job. I either kept my salary and let go 5 employees or I could take a pay cut and keep mothers and fathers employed."
good,We are a team of baristas who make lattes from day to day help each other with struggles and guide each other to perfection. We constantly strive to make each customer's day start off with the best quality beverage made to standard.
good,Everyday was very fast-paced and busy. Sometimes it was difficult to work under so much pressure but overall I really enjoyed myself! I loved interacting with the public and meeting new people everyday. I've really gained the knowledge of what customer service is all about.
good,"I worked here for 7 1/2 years and everyday I consider going back.  Over the years I worked at many different locations in 3 different states.  I loved the fact that whenever I moved I was able to easily transfer to a new store.  Working here definitely had it's own culture and it's very easy to become close friends with those you work with since it is such a team oriented atmosphere.  "
good,You're always busy which makes for a quick work day. Clients that came in were young and fun to be around. Management didn't seem to be around that much but we had shift leads to help.
good,probably the best job i have had so far just management needs a little more work as theres micro management going on sometimes
good,"Faced paced always multitasking. Fun to meet new people and see regulars daily. The most enjoyable part was building relationships with customers getting to know them as individuals. Starbucks is always changing adding new items, drinks and merchandise, and promotions keeping you on your toes with learning new stuff every couple weeks. Did not like the consistency of Starbucks they are different everywhere you go unfortunately and treat inside store Starbucks ; Vons, Ralphs; Target etc.... differently then stand alone Starbucks."
good,"Very quick-paced job"
good,"Starbucks was hard but fun work. I learned so much about customer service in my years, as well as cash-handling and training new employees."
good,"Overall, starbucks is a great company to work for. They offer amazing benefits and even offer to pay for school. The actual job is challenging and physically demanding. It is a fast paced work environment and requires one to act under pressure often. Customers are often rude and impatient which makes the job more challenging."
good,"This was a fast paced fun job that provided incredible training with interpersonal relations, conflict resolution, time management and discovering talent both within ones self and others."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for! Howard Schultz (C.E.O. and founder) Has made Starbucks to be your second family, they'll take care of you even when you've hit rock bottom."
good,"most of the new things i learned in this organization. customers need, problem solving, leadership, teamwork etc. management always giving the freedom for our creativity."
good,"It is easy to forget how much good management and pleasant coworkers can make a job easier and more enjoyable. My store manager at Starbucks is the best boss I have ever had, and my coworkers make the daily grind so much easier to handle. We all support each other and rarely make negative comments, criticism always being handled in a friendly, or at least professional, manner. I cannot speak for every Starbucks location, but my experience has been wonderful."
good,"Great company to work for or get your start. Excellent benefits including 401k, stock options, health/dental/vision insurance, free pound of coffee a week. Typical depends on your placement. You're either ringing up customers, making drinks, stocking and cleaning or grabbing to coffee/pastries for the person on bar. When you have a good team on this, it runs like clockwork."
good,It was a great place to work. The staff and management was very friendly. It was also great way to meet new people and get to know the customers as well.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work!"
good,Working at Starbucks grew me more in customer service. It taught me how to deal with various people and situations. Starbucks was not only a job but like a second home. The management and co-workers there were super supportive and helpful.
good,"In a fast-paced environment, speed, efficiency, and connection is key. We must work well alongside partners to commit to excellence service and great tasting coffee. "
good,"Overall great company to work for. Great atmosphere, benefits, and work life balance. If you love coffee and love social interaction then Starbucks is the place for you!"
good,"I have worked at Starbucks for about two years now and I love working there. I enjoy many things about working at Starbucks, I love what they're about, I love the customers, I love the environment and I love my coworkers. Working there gives me a sense of family and belonging, we all work very well together and we're a tight knit group. Starbucks emphasizes very much on their excellent customer service, it's one of the first things they teach you when you begin training. The main goal is to let everyone leave our store with the same sense of belonging that working there will give its employees. We strive to connect with each customer, welcome them, teach them and deliver the ultimate experience. I love that. I love being able to connect with complete strangers over a cup of coffee. "
good,"Overall good place to work.  Must always be productive and maintain composure in a fast-paced environment.  "
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for if you like face-to-face interactions and getting to know people."
good,A typical day at Starbucks is busy yet fun. I work with most females so the atmosphere is interesting. Very upbeat management and peers.
good,"Starbucks coffee shop is different from other coffee shop because we   want our customers to feel like home and our staffs are like families. We are trained to treat each customers specially no matter they are regular or not. Smiles is our priority behaviour. I need to do the cash management and run everyone's break. Also, I have to maintain store's clean and neat. Co-workers care about each other and we help each other to learn new knowledge. "
good,"es normal al llegar y snetirse nueva pero los companeros de trabajo te ayudan a desenvolverte,aprendi a no ser muy timida ni callada, mis jefes eran bueno me ayudaban cuando necesitaba algunas urgencia, mi equipo de trabajo muy buen ambiente,hacer los inventarios y cerrar.aprender de muchas personas y atender  a las personas"
good,"The position as barista is fast paced, and slow paced up and down throughout shifts. Lulls allow for recuperation and preparation for the next rush. Supervisors are always strict, yet understanding and do their best to make sure all duties are thoroughly and timely done, making work more enjoyable."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. Most stores are open around 4 or 5am until on average 10pm at night, so people with other obligations can still get a decent amount of hours in per week. You can pick up shifts at other stores, and if something comes up where you need your own shift covered there are usually plenty of people to ask. It is a good place to work for if you move frequently, as you can transfer stores after every 6 months of being at one store."
good,"I learned how to work with all types of people and respect everyones'  unique personalities. Starbucks is all around a great company and very encouraging to their employees. "
good,"Great company, organized and pushes employees to work very hard. It grooms employees to be above standard within the food industry as far as cleanliness, time management and presentation."
good,Servent leadership is practiced and leads to a great respectful working environment

good,"It's never a dull moment at Starbucks, whether you're a customer or employee. Starbucks is not just a company, it's a thriving culture. Through my years with them, I learned not only how to function and perform as part of a team, but go on to learn how to lead teams of my own. I learned how the smallest acts of compassion and kindness can make a difference in people's lives, as well as in the community. I learned how to be a successful business manager and mentor to others. The people you work with at Starbucks all tend to share a similar trait of standing out somehow as individuals, yet meshing together to form a unique team of partners who all have something to contribute. "
good,"Flexible schedule"
good,"A typical day at work was pretty smooth. "
good,Great work environment and co-workers felt like family. Flexible hours and good benefits. This company cares about its employees!
good,"A typical day at work consist of hourly stocking of common items like cup lids, coffee cup sleeves, ect. I have learned to manage my time to the fullest due to fast paced work environment. The co-workers there at Starbucks are friendly, experianced and are able to handle same work load as myself.n The most difficult part of the job is to remember custom drink orders and handle Thursday morning and afternoon rush (ex 150 customers per 45 min to 1 hr)"
good,"I totally loved Starbucks. If I hadn't of had 3 extreme inner ear infections that lasted 6 months, I would have love to stay working there. The co workers were of all age levels, which was nice. The most enjoyable part of the job for me, was meeting and interacting with many people on a daily basis. I am a people person first and foremost ;)."
good,"Starbucks was a great job through my senior year of college, because of the flexible work hours and the people.  A typical day at work begin early at 4:30 am, so I could get off early go to class, and my paid internship.  As shift supervisor, my first priority everyday was to begin delegating tasks and be consistently aware of the team morale.  Constant awareness of team morale helped me to understand when to leverage partners and when to refocus the team to the common goal of outstanding customer service.  The store I worked at was a neighborhood store, which gave our shop a stronger sense of community through a loyal customers, new-comers, and people passing through to work.  As part of the management team I was put in charge of daily organizational tasks that contributed to the overall flow of business. "
good,"Ability to train people;"
good,Starbucks Coffee is a great company to work for. They offer many benefits from health insurance to educational assistance to their younger workforce and are genuinely invested in the success of their employees beyond the workplace.
good,"Provided fast and vigilant customer service while juggling multiple tasks. Advanced to position of manager after 6 months of employment. Great benefits, medical, dental etc. and free coffee every week for employees to gain better understanding of product for customers."
good,"Way too much work and not enough time to do it in! I learned everything from multi-tasking to how to deal with every and any situation. The managment can go both ways, but they have checks and balences. do work and all will be fine, your coworkers and managers will like you all the more when you put your head down and work. The hardest part is dealing with unappriciative customers and people who don't appreciate ALL the HARD work we do, just for your darn drink. The customers and coworkers make going to work worth while!"
good,"While working as a manager I have learned how to manage my time, delegate responsibilities, and become more assertive. I am able to relate to my employees and customers. The hardest part of my job has been making sure everything get's done in limited time. The most enjoyable part of the job has been working with and around great people."
good,The best place to work for in food service.  I moved up after only working there for four months.  Can be tiresome for someone not on salary however.
good,"Typical day at work was always made fun."
good,"Starbucks is a back and forth job, it can be very busy or very slow at certain times.  Shifts can be exhausting but fast, you'll learn a lot about coffee.  At my center, we do not find our management to be the greatest, but that is just one store. My co-workers are great people and hard workers.  The hardest part of the job is leaving.  The most enjoyable part is the people, customers and co-workers."
good,"I started at Starbucks and grew with the company for 12 years, I am at a different place in my life with a family now and would love to find something I can do from home."
good,"You have to be quick on your feet and ready to repeat ""the customer is always right"" in your head whenever customers want their drink remade. Otherwise the smell of coffee all day is nice and you hear alot of different stories from various customers."
good,This company is one of the best to work for. The benefits are great and its a great environment to be in on the daily basis.
good,"Your Starbucks work experience is like many other jobs as for morale is cncerned.  The kind of day youre going to have is based on the personality of you and your co workers,  and on your attitude about working. It is imperative that you know how to multi-task, because if you do not it will be overwhelming and you will want to quit.  The benefits are the best.  You automatically are invested in stock, they match you at 6% for 401k. Based on performance, every 6 months you get a pay increase.  Overall the job is amazing. You meet incredible people, make awesome connections, not just with your co-workers, but especially with the customers"
good,"Any given day it can be a stressful and fun job. During a rush it is fun, everyone is working together, customers are talking with you. It is stressful at the same time because you are trying to get drinks out as fast as possible. People need to get to work, or whatever place they need to be. Going from barista to store manager was a great opportunity. Even as a manager, if you could balance paperwork with customer service it was a fun job. There is always stress in any position though. Keeping up with targets, changing drinks, routines, coaching..."
good,"Communication is very important when working. You will also develop     "
good,great experience! had great employees and learned so much about Marketing and Contract implimentation

good,"I maintain customer relations, handle store inventory, analyze profit and loss reports, Lead trainer."
good,"Over the years I have learned the importance of motivating and inspiring my team to do the very best that they can do. With out my employees, I would have not been able to accomplish the amount of success that I have achieved over the years!"
good,"Worked there throughout uni and after. Very flexible hours, great benefits, tendency to connect well with coworkers, lots of opportunity for advancement."
good,"Es de los mejores trabajos que ha tenido durante mi vida laboral,el dia dia de trabajo se conseste en conectar con las personas ( emleados, clientes , provedores....)mas todo esto servir un producto de primera calidad , con un buen trato al cliente."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. It's fun, you meet all kinds of fun and interesting people, and the benefits for even a part time employee are amazing. As with any retail job, you have your ups and downs, but overall, I definitely recommend it. The main thing I have learned is how to multi-task. My particular store is a higher volume store, so our rushes are huge. In order to get through the rush, you have to move quickly and do several things at once. It is overwhelming at first, but once you get used to it, you're fine! My co-workers and I get along great! Many of the girls I work with are my age, so we are able to relate very well. My favorite part of the job is seeing the look one someone's face when I tell the the person before them paid for their order."
good,"I started as a Baristas and loved my job. Was promoted to ASM, SM and then DM. I loved meeting new people and putting a smile on their faces."
good,I love working for Starbucks tha atmosphere is very positive and it makes you want to work.
good,I loved making drinks and creating things. I also like interacting with the customers and making them feel better. My co-workers and boss were great! I am still friends with many of them. The hardest part was making multiple orders quickly but that was also the most fun part. I learned how to deal with stress better and how to work efficiently in a high stress environment.
good,I found that working at Starbucks the managers are quite flexible with your scheudle and willing to give you time off. The benefits are fantastic and they treat their employees well.
good,"Typical day of work involved making drinks for customers, taking orders, cleaning, re-stocking, learning new drink recipes, analyzing different styles of coffees, and going over progress of the store.  Management was frequently changing, co-workers were great and motivating, the most enjoyable part of the job was the one on one interaction with customers."
good,I do my best to meet the customers needs and give them the best experience they can possibly have while in my store. my co-workers and management staff are top notch. The hardest part of my job is meeting the demand of a large amount of customers while understaffed. The thing I enjoy most about my job is being able to turn customers on to new beverages that have not tried before.
good,"Starbucks is an excellent place to work. Leadership is fully supportive of all team members and truly care about your work experiences. A typical day as a store manager includes reviewing financials, merchandising, training and development of team members, building sales and maintaining food safety and health standards. "
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for If I were to go else where it would have to be a company that is comparable. In Mission statement and structure. a company that helps communities. A company that cares about environment and there Partners. I adore my team and respect them.
good,"The most valuable lessons I have learned from working as a Barista at Starbucks are time management; how to effectively and efficiently multitask, something that previously was extremely difficult in high stress situations."
good,"A typical day at work requires friendly customer service, cash management, preparing food and drinks, daily cleaning tasks, temperature and cash logs. I've learned ways to deal with every kind of person in a friendly manner, how to work at a fast paced alone and with others. Management is well organized, friendly and productive. Co-worekers are typically friendly, hard working individuals. Most of them are young students including myself. The hardest part of the job is working with customers who may not be happy with their services. the most enjoyable part of my day is being able to positively connect with costumers, and building relationships with them."
good,"Good company to work for, great to deal with customers and partners.  Very high pace work environment have to be able to multitask in pleasant manner."
good,"Opening or closing shifts,training, scheduling and management of staff, managing supply inventory and ordering, monitor financial procedures. I was working and managing about 15 staff. The hardest part of my job was making happy every customers even those very demanding one. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting every day lots of different people and environment at work."
good,Great benefits for entry level position. I worked there for many years and was amazed on how much support the management team received.
good,"I really liked interacting with my fellow customers and coworkers. I loved the culture and the diversity they had. I worked there for five years and I have to admit, it was one of the best jobs I ever had. If I wasn't almost done with getting my degree I would probably go back."
good,"Mi día en starbucks, era llegar, ponerse el uniforme, contar el dinero de las cajas, ver que todo estaba en orden y directamente servir cafés y desayunos a la gente, íbamos por turnos, y cuando nos tocaba cambio, me tocaba salir a recoger la basura y platos de la gente, fregarlos, y cambiar el turno."
good,"The benefits that starbucks offer their employees is the best Pro when looking at the quality of the company. They do take care if their employees, some people have been there for 10-20 years because their benefits are so high ranking! They offer almost anything health wise, and you can enroll in the starbucks EAP (employee assistance program) which basically is a hotline that can help you with (literally) anything! It is definitely not common for companies to offer this much to their employees anymore so it is something to value for sure. The downside is the hours, I could only work mornings I went in at 4 AM and worked flexible hours. However, the hours aren't so great for most people store hrs are normally 5am-10pm. Expect to work crazy hours during holidays and black friday! Overall, it's a great company and perfect for those people who have the availability, you will enjoy your job either way!"
good,it is great environment to work.Always having great time at work. meeting new people. they treat each other with respect
good,"A typical day at Starbucks for me was about 6 am. I come in and make sure my team has begun their tasks for the day, pick up wherever they left off, and then begin to provide customer service our customers on their morning commute. I learned a lot about people and their habits and how to deal with all types of situations in the workplace. Management at Starbucks always stayed on top of the business and addressed problems in a timely manner as they happened. The hardest part of the job was realizing that I was out growing it and time for me to leave a place that I enjoy working to better myself."
good,"I love how balanced it is. Some days are very busy so we concentrate mainly on the business and getting things done while maintaining excellent customer service. On a quieter days we have fun with co-workers and customers. I like meeting new people from all of the world and from different backgrounds, for me it is exciting getting to know our customers better. My co-workers are amazing, we are a team."
good,I found Starbucks a great place to work.  I enjoyed all the marketing tools provided for the store when new drinks or product promotions came out.  My supervisor was dedicated to her store and the employees and customers.  I enjoyed working with my fellow partners. I enjoyed doing things for the community around us.
good,"A very good paste job, sometimes their will be a morning rush which is expected. I Have learn very good customer service and can tell how people are doing or starting their day off by facial expressions. Which showed my how to approach that individual. My co-workers support me a lot though medical school and will support me with a new job. hardest part of the job is always have to have a good persona after working long and busy hours. The most enjoyable part of my job are the customers, coworkers, and very good benefits and how the Starbucks company treats their employees good."
good,Working at Starbucks was a fast pace job which is enjoyable. I loved interacting with the clients and brining customer satisfaction to them. Being promoted to a shift manager within three months of working their helped me decide that I wanted to stay in Management. I love running a store and being a team leader. I also love training new employeed and bringing motivaton towards their job.
good,"Always been connecting to customers who have been loyal to us."
good,"I joined Starbucks for the culture and stayed because of the people that live it. When you work for Starbucks, you have to be all in and it can be difficult to find others with that same passion, but they teach you and coach you on how to provide that to your employees and live it every day. "
good,"I enjoyed working here and learned a lot about business in general, including the most effective way to run and manage a store and how to work efficiently."
good,"A Starbucks coloca como primeiro objetivo agradar aos clientes, os colaboradores são, em geral, treinados para atender de maneira educada e prestativa os clientes."
good,Starbucks is a very fast pasted environment. I learned How to interact more with the customers making sure they had a great experience in Starbucks. Most Co workers are friendly.
good,"A typical day at work is basically always help the customer first! They are priority before taking care of any tasks. These tasks include stocking product that we will need throughout the day. What I have learned with Starbucks is that our customers are awesome and loyal. I have learned patience and how to be a team player throughout the years with this company. My current manager with Starbucks is great. The co-workers and our manager all strive to do what is best for Starbucks and the profitability. "
good,"Llegas al trabajo y a veces lo que falla es que los gerenciales no tienen buena comunicación entre ellos y no se ponen de acuerdo en qué posición tomarás ese día, o es diferente lo que te dicen al deployment. En general el ambiente que tratamos de generar es el de llevarnos todos bien, evitar malos comentarios o malas caras delante de los clientes, el hecho de que nos llevemos bien es lo que reflejamos; en sí no hay una parte difícil en el trabajo, si acaso un poco el salario; lo que más me gusta es que siempre ponen al cliente en primer lugar y el ambiente que tenemos."
good,"> Preparing drinks for our customers, giving legendary service to our customer and managing the store and developing partners are the things I do everyday at work"
good,"A typical day at work included serving customers with a world class attitude, making coffee to specifications, connecting with every customer, general cleaning tasks, administrative tasks."
good,"Typical day was preparing food and coffee for customers."
good,So many interesting and fun people to work with. Did well with my school schedule and learned how to have excellent customer service
good,"Shifts including making sure the Barista's had what they needed to work the shift, counting monies for the bank run, making friends with the customers and meeting their needs of coffee with a smile. I learned that management of people consisted of giving them room to do their job and be there to support them in whatever they needed. The hardest part of the job was closing down late at night. The best part was getting coffee first thing in the morning and enjoying the quiet mornings."
good,"A typical day at work began while a majority of the world still slept in the dark. I learned to manage company policies and procedures, inventory, time management, and to teach others through on the job training. Management at this store and several others I worked at over the years has been relatively easy to work with; and my co-workers and I have established family bonds through many times toiling with one another. The hardest part of my job requirements include a feeling of inadequacy, as I long to do something in a career of my choice. The most enjoyable part of this job is that I have been able to touch others in their daily routines, offering compassion and a smile to those who come to the store for refreshment."
good,a typical day at work is serving client. When I come in I either work at the registers or behind the drink bar. I learned how to make drinks which I think was cool. The management are all cool and laid back. Very easy to get along with them. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. When you don't know something they are all welling to train you and help you in any way possible. The hardest part of the job was learning all the drinks and how to make them. The best part of my job is remembering all the customers name's and knowing their drink before they can say anything. they love it.
good,"very busy, day never goes by slowly"
good,"Starbucks is all about improving the lives of their customers one drink at a time. They emphasize creating human connections so that their customers see Starbucks as a safe haven, a home away from home. The best part about working for Starbucks is the valuable time you get to spend with each person that walks through the door, if your encounter is successful, you are filled with joy and so is the customer. Drink making is the hardest part about working here, as there are many recipes that need to be memorized and then recreated in reality at a very fast pace. What I learned at Starbucks is that Starbuck's success is build around relationships, and not so much the Coffee itself."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, been here for four going on five years, only problem I would say I had was there wasn't exactly room to grow. Also, the strict uniform became challenging to deal with but overall I enjoyed working here and would encourage anyone to work here. Especially if you need benefits from what I heard the benefits here are great, I don't have any experience with dealing with the benefits but the hours are also great. "
good,"Busy from 7am- 9am"
good,"Starbucks is a true ambassador of its mission statement. "
good,"If you are looking for a job to have fun and make new friends behind and in front of the counter, Starbucks is definitely the place to be. I loved working there, but the only downfall was the pay, which is essentially why I left the company."
good,Great place to work they take care of the employees with many different areas of care. definitely one of the better places to work.
good,"I love being a part of the Starbucks team. It is a nice place to meet new people, and the environment is amazing."
good,"I was a part time employee on two seperate occasions at two different Starbucks stores, both drive thrus. I worked around 25-30 hours a week."
good,"Starbucks Coffee bases its foundation on structured policies and procedures. Numerous resources are provided for learning about legendary customer service, providing a third place environment for all and partner development. As a supervisor my daily objective was to delegate task to my partners to ensure safety, cleanliness and create satisfaction for them as well as my guest. Multi tasking was the key to success. That alone is a tool that I learned to master and will take on into future job positions. Dealing with ambiguity is the easiest and hardest part of the job because of the many interactions with partners as well as customers."
good,"Working at Starbucks can be a challenge at times but an enjoyable one as well. I've learned that having patience with customers is a very good trait to have because sometimes you have to work with a customer to make sure that what they order is correct and the way they want it. Management is wonderful, granted things change and everyone may not agree, but at the end of the day, it is to help the store. My co-workers are wonderful, they make working fun and enjoyable. We are a team and when one has to deal with an unruly customer we all deal with the unruly customer. The hardest part of the job is when you have a line and you are going as fast as you can to give the customers their drinks and they still complain about the speed. It makes you feel like you're not doing your best even when you are. The most enjoyable part is working with my co-workers and interacting with the customers, you never know who you will connect with and who will leave a lasting impression on you."
good,I like because i need the inpolment .Working for will be great.I like to serve coffe at starbucks
good,"I love that Starbucks moves in such a fast pace but makes a personal impression on each and every individual that comes in. I learned that having a team makes the operation run smoothly. the Hardest Part of the job for me was being there at 4:45 am every morning, but what made it enjoyable is opening the door at 5 am and being greeted bt the same loyal customers for the rest of the day. Companies with loyal customers are the ones the grow!"
good,A work day usually consists of helping customers enjoy their Starbucks experience. We make sure that the customers are leaving happy with their drink and over all time at the store.
good,Great place to work. Good experience for someone just starting out. Good oppurtunity to earn a decent living if you're willing to work hard.
good,"This job helped me to build up my confidence to interact with Customers in a day to day basis and daily I am learning something new, I also learned the highest level of professionalism, all of us including the management team are working with respect and dignity thats why the working environment is almost excellent and the most enjoyable part is that we get to sit down before the start of our shift to do Coffee tasting and discuss our goals for the shift and review them after the shift and if so... we give recognition for the team and individuals."
good,"When you think of Starbucks you automatically think of coffee, but once you are a partner (employee) you enter a whole new world! As a partner you learn and connect on a whole other level. Starbucks is a great place to work, where you make long lasting friendships."
good,Making drinks and serving a diverse clientele. Day to day there was like an adventure
good,"The name behind Starbucks holds a prestigious, serious money making business. But my location is in central, very rough part of San Diego. Aside from learning the ins and outs of responsibilities, the clientele and culture of the workplace make going to work a different day every day. I got to know regulars with a quickness, understanding needs, adapt with strong to timid personalities. I bonded and got along with co-workers well. The hardest part was balancing expectations with a fast pace setting. Of course, the pace got easier with time. I enjoy working here day to day. But I feel that this is not the career path for me."
good,"Great job for college students, job security was great for employees that go to college and need to transfer to a store near school."
good,Here I learned how to better interact with customers. All my co-workers and managers were very nice and helpful at all times. It was an enjoyable enviroment and I was able to have intelligent conversations with my co-workers and the customers.
good,"starbucks was a great company to work for, with great staff members and a fab working relactionship with the customers."
good,"I like the company I am working for. I enjoy working in fast-pace environment.Typical day is either opening shift, 5:30 am-2 pm, or closing shift, 1:30 pm-9:30 pm. I gained good knowledge of customer service, placing orders, solving upcoming problems efficiently, working as a part of the team, multitasking The management is fare. The hardest part of the job is co-workers. If they care and are committed to do their job, then it is the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Rustan Coffee Corporation in Philippines is a well respected company, and working there is really something, or someone should be proud of."
good,You meet alot of different people and you learn new thing about the people you work with and about life. The management are very fair with personal and problems in the work place. My co-workers are very nice people to work with. The hardest part about my job is stay with the flow of orders. I enjoy meeting new people.
good,"store manager, managed over 50 employees. managed 10 other store payroll and systems. learn all aspects of management during my 9yrs with the company."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. This is especially true when you first enter the workforce or if you are still in school. One of my favorite things about Starbucks is simply the people. That being said, the manager definitely sets the mood for the whole floor. If you have a bad manager, you'll have a bad time."
good,"My time spent with Starbucks was very well and I really have no complaints against the company. The management was very strong although it was a bit hard to move up in the company, but the shifts were ran efficiently and coworkers were very nice and reliable people."
good,"typical day is fast paced, lots of stuff to do all the time, nice people, good benefits,"
good,"Starbucks has been a college job that all my friends are envious of! Along with learning coffee making skills, one learned top notch customer service skills, money handling skill, schedule management, and how to work in a team."
good,"First off, Starbucks might've been the best job I've had thus far. Talking to people everyday and having fun while you knock out drinks faster than a speeding bullet. You get paid every week and you get tips every week. For me, I was always on bar because I was so fast and I made everything good. Never had a complaint and customers loved me. The only reason why I left was because there wasn't enough hours to go around and we kept hiring new people and people kept quitting. Now, when you're used to things going at a fast pace, especially when it's really busy, new people aren't exactly what you want to deal with at the moment and when there's a lot of new people coming in at the same time, it can get hectic. The other reason was I was on bar ALL the time, it was like no one could be as fast as me and it got irritating. Even when I was off the bar and was on cashier or coffee station or expediting, I would eventually get back on bar. But, overall, great place to work."
good,"Starbucks Coffee Company is an excellent place for students or other young professionals to get a great start. They provide excellent part-time employee benefits, decent pay, and a really pleasant working environment. There is encouragement to become familiar with the product, but not an excessive amount of pressure placed on new employees to sell."
good,"Working at Starbucks you need to have a loose availability where you can work a lot. Being in a position where I’m trying to figure out college since I will be a freshman in college, I needed to find something easier and a place where they are ok with my availability. Other than that it’s a great place to work with great people around you and awesome benefits!"
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. But like all companies it has its pros and cons. "
good,as 0Job can be very tedious especially in a busy location. There perks outside of that make it worth it. I wish the baristas were paid more. I believe their only paid a little more than minimum
good,"Great benefits, nice people. Management cares about their partners and the company is fantastic. Many opportunities for advancement. I appreciated the community service aspect as well, it’s not just a coffee company."
good,Working at Starbucks has been a great experience. I have learned a lot from my coworkers and higher up managers on basic life skills. I have learned a lot about how a company works and what each role of an employee is and how important it is to work as a team.
good,This was an excellent first job for me when I was in high school. I have continued to work with them throughout the rest of high school and into college. The hours are flexible to accommodate my schedule and the ability to transfer between stores when I moved for college was amazing. The benefits you receive here way surpass those at other job opportunities of this type.
good,"It was a standard coffee job there were a lot of regulars which was nice, due to the intricate machines cleaning proved to be a hassle sometimes but aside from that, it was pretty great!"
good,"Flexibility isn’t promised, neither are your hours. However, you gain more experience and connection than you would anywhere else and that is special."
good,"I loved working here, everything from the atmosphere to the coffee culture itself. I learned quite a lot, from the different roasts, to different coffee lore. I loved all of my co workers, and whenever it got busy. We could all buckle down and work through the rush as a team. It was really rewarding, I became a shift lead within three months. I am glad I worked here, I learned a lot about myself, and learned how to really work with people. I loved our customers, and I loved getting to know everyone that would come in. This job challenged me in ways, I haven't been challenged before, I learned, how to memorize thousands of drinks,  how to make every single drink quickly, and I learned how to deal with some tough customer interactions and leave them satisfied, I also learned how to manage a floor of 11 people, and have people in their places.  I would often have regulars come back, just to get the drinks I had made. Our management was fantastic honestly, I bounced around at two to three stores every week. But every manager was right for the store, and I was blown away, at the level of care, and detail that upper management gave to us."
good,"I one hundred percent would recommend this job to up beat, social person. The setting is fun and social. It is very fast-paced, and you will need to remember a lot, but the benefits are the best part!"
good,"Ótima oportunidade de crescimento, oferecem o suporte necessário para o desempenho e plano de desenvolvimento."
good,i really feel proud to work over there sometime i felt hard because it was new challenge job for me to learn about coffee and barista role.I like the training part of Starbucks. All the team members were very collaborative.
good,"Shifts were a bit rude to coworkers when asked a question or asked for help. Coworkers often talked about me behind my back in a rude way, took store manager a while to do something."
good,"As a Starbucks employee you do a variety of tasks: barista, cleaning, management, warm food, work drive-thru (location dependent), restock, etc. People are friendly, helpful, encouraging, and determined to serve customers."
good,Starbucks is a great hard-working environment that has loads of social benefits. They look after all their partners (staff) incredibly well and reward those that work hard. Although stressful at times the social aspect of your work colleagues and the public outweigh and help reset any worries you may have about the job.
good,"Bonding over coffee became exciting with not only fellow partners (associates) but also the bonding you do with the customers. The perks are great and schedules are pretty flexible, with a nice balance with what you need at any given time in your life. You become a family with your partners and that makes Starbucks a special place to work."
good,"I had a lot of positive experiences with working at Starbucks. Though, sometime the management was at times, lacking. Overall, I had a positive experience in my two years there."
good,The relationships you build with your co-workers is easily the best part of the job. Everyone there is so supportive and friendly to one another and customers.
good,"Starbucks of course offers great benefits to its employees. Yet, with my experience the managers always tend to care about the customers happiness rather than the employees. Employees are expected to act like robots and go above and beyond for customers even if we are being treated like absolute trash by them. Starbucks does not have employees back when it comes to situations like that, but I guess the benefits make it worth it"
good,"Depending on your manager, the hours are super flexible. Free drinks at the store you work at all the time (still got the hook up after quitting). You get to take home a pound of coffee every week (or another retail product home). 30% discount on absolutely anything at any starbucks."
good,My manager was absolutely phenomenal. She always worked as hard as she expected us to work and was understanding in most situations. They trained me on how to do job specific things and made it pretty simple to do what you needed to.
good,Starbucks give a big opportunity for developing your skills and amazing training. They don’t look for language barrier and give chance to everyone including young people without any experience
good,"I love working there, the majority of customers were very friendly and I enjoyed making conversation with most and the work was challenging at first, but slowly got better with time."
good,I do love my job and appreciate all the learning opportunities and growth I’ve made in almost the 2 years I’ve spent working there. But I feel like the company cares more about the customers than the employees. Which is good for a business in a sense but I just personally feel like they could work on making sure their partners are okay. We’re just a little under appreciated.
good,It was a very fun experience working at Starbucks. I met a lot of new people and gained some new friends. Everyone would have conversations but stayed on task while working. I would work there again if I needed a place to work.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks, although I had some management issues for the first year. I was over-scheduled, overworked, and my boss often made inappropriate, unprofessional comments about me as well as other coworkers. He rarely supported his workers and allowed other supervisors to take advantage of them. After I left for a season for another job, I came back to the company to a brand new location, with new management, and a new regional manager. I enjoyed my time even more than the first round."
good,"I loved being a barista. There were some down sides to the job, but there were many upsides as well. Benefits are amazing. Free coffee too. Hiring managers that know nothing about coffee defeats the purpose of promoting people from within."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks. It offered many benefits including education. I loved the enthusiasm put towards customer satisfaction. If i had the opportunity i would love to work there again.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks mainly because of how small the particular location I worked at was. Everything was close by and easy to restock and it never got too busy. They were very flexible with hours and when I was having troubles in my personal life they were very supportive and caring
good,"I had an excellent time being a partner in Calgary but once I was placed in Vancouver, my manager at the 24 hours Starbucks was exceedingly rude and un-professional towards mental and physical health."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. It was fun and I loved doing inventory, stocking and customer service. This job truly felt like a home away from home."
good,was my first job. im happy I got the job. it was really fun and my managers made me feel appreciated. cool place if you are looking for your first job.
good,"Tienes la oportunidad de estudiar y trabajar, puedes crecer dentro de la misma empresa, excelentes prestaciones."
good,"When showing up to work most days are smooth, great environment, and fast pace. I work as a supervisor so I oversee the team and make sure my day part goes smooth and easy for partners and customers."
good,Starbucks taught me a lot in the F&B industry. I develop a passion for the products that I’m selling and sharing knowledges about it to the people. The workplace culture is very welcoming and there’s more room to grow in the roles that you do everyday.
good,A lot of work but good benefits. Sometimes it felt like I wasn't paid enough but the benefits are much better than you'd get in other fast food/coffee shops
good,"I worked at Starbucks as a barista for 10 months, and the overall experience was lovely. I worked alongside with a great team, who were patient and supportive. The culture there was young and freeing-- I felt at home while I was employed there."
good,You're going to be working with people that will get to know through there addiction to drinks.  It is satisfying to know that you made someone's day better.  Your on a team and your goal is to provide the best possible service to the community.
good,"I learned a lot of things while working at Starbucks, but mostly I learned about customer service. I learned many other things including inventory, and sales, but my most valuable skill that I learned is managing employees."
good,"Fue una gran escuela laboral, aquilató mucho en varias áreas de mi vida trabajar ahí. Conocí tantas cosas que en ningún otro lugar de mi ciudad hubiera podido aprender."
good,"I took a major pay cut after quoting my job as a CNA/PCA, though Starbucks is most definitely fast paced and still stressful, you always have a coworker to lean on and talk to if you’re frustrated or sad. The two SM’s I had were very understanding of illness, and needing time off or more hours! Good discounts and free drinks on break, a reasonable dress code."
good,"The work environment is fun and inviting, however you need to be prepared to multitask. The job has a lot of benefits such as a 401k, heath insurence, free four year degree at ASU (Arizona State University) .These are all worth while but you must be able to keep up with the high speed work environment, as well as be able to multitask."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is enjoyable. It's fast-paced and busy most of the time. Partners are able to interact with customers and make meaningful connections. During downtimes, partners clean the store and connect with more customers. The workplace environment is mostly positive, welcoming, and full of energy!"
good,The job introduces you to a variety of new people. It's a fun environment. The job can get stressful with holidays and seasonal promotions. You get tips on the days you work.
good,Friendly informative employees help training.  Fast pace never a dull moment. Great benefit offered to all employees full time or part time. Discounts on food beverages and merchandise. 401k and stock options available as well.
good,"Good benefits, good people, lots of work, probably understaffed and stressed, annoying customers, low pay for what you do but free spotify and other perks help :)"
good,"Most of the employees are energetic and friendly.  The managers typically are on point with managing the day to day activities.  If it wasn't for needing a little time off to be a stay at home mom, I would probably still be working at Starbucks most likely as a store manager.  I was asked to be a shift supervisor with in 4 months of working at this company."
good,Starbucks is a good place for part time employees. They offer benefits to both PT and FT staff as long as 20hrs/week are worked. A lot of opportunity for advancement.
good,"Starbucks is an awesome company especially if you consider the benefit of paid school at just 20 hours a week. Personally I have great coworkers, management is good, although for a brief period we had a temp manager who was absolutely horrible. You receive unlimited drinks on your shift and one food markout. Each week you are allowed to take home a lb of coffee, pods or via. Your schedule is available for 3 weeks at a time, which is nice because if you forget to request time off for something you have plenty of time to find coverage. I also love that you have decent paid sick time, I don't remember how it's earned but after a year of service I had 30+ hours available. Pay is not low, but not great either. You receive weekly tips as well. What I hate is paid time off starts one full year after employment, and is so slow. For I believe every 40 hours you get approx 2 hours. The average person is scheduled 20-25 hours at my location, which isnt enough hours for those of us with real bills and makes earning vacation quite a drag. Like any other retail job, you'll have regular customers you love and some you'll dread!"
good,Over my 10 years at Starbucks I enjoyed greeting the customers and making sure they felt welcome and then serving them their beverages and also clearing up after they'd left as well as asking them if they were enjoying their experience and day in general! Co-ordination occasionally got in the way but I worked a way around it.
good,"It depends on a rota but it can be negotiable with your manager. "
good,learned a lot about the working environment and they helped a lot when i needed it. a great place to start your first job in order to gain experience.
good,"I really enjoy working for this company. The company has very easy to access tools to help partners learn more about the company and grow in the company. Starbucks takes pride in their all-inclusive attitude towards employees as well as customers. If any management problems should arise, help is easily accessible and readily available. A very fun environment to work in, centered around team work and customer satisfaction."
good,"If you want a stepping stone for the rest of your career, choose Starbucks. If you stick to it, you'll learn a great deal about how to manager under pressure, and to be ready for the tests that the job (foreshadowing all your future jobs) will throw at you."
good,"It is a great place to work whether it is your first job or another one you are coming in to. It is very fast-paced and the volume of certain stores is wild, but the paycheck, partners, and benefits is so worth it."
good,"Starbucks can be great place to work, when you re with the right management team. there can be some flaws but overall it is a great place to work. With some of the best benefits around."
good,"Excellent company culture from top down.  Inconsistent adherence to standards from location to location.  I loved the stores I worked at, but have seen several I would not recommend."
good,"In my experience working at various Starbucks stores, my coworkers have always been the highlight of my day. I have fun at work because Starbucks hires kind, encouraging, and fun people."
good,"I do love working at Starbucks, but during its busiest hours it can be a bit stressful. Amazing benefits and pretty decent pay rate. Pretty flexible if your availability needs to change"
good,Spent most of the time working very hard. Company typically understaffed known busy days and we had to pick up the slack. Good benefits and great coworkers though. You either get the best customers or the ones that threaten your life (happened to me).
good,"A normal work day is fun and can either be sometimes relaxed or sometimes stressful depending on what type of day it is. Overall Starbucks is a great company who genuinely cares for their workers but their pay raise is horrible, not a great career place but to help get you through college I would definitely recommend."
good,"Really good entry job with lots of room for growth , flexibilty , an development really can't go wrong working here and benefits are great as well lots of easy work."
good,Learning how to make the drinks and the recipes was the hardest part about the job. Everything else is really easy to manage. My tip is to connect with the customers and your co-workers. They make your job and shift easier.
good,"Working at Starbucks, I learned to stay on my toes. Once you get the hang of the layout and drink menu it's an amazing place to work. It allows you to create amazing time management skills."
good,"A typical day would look like a cycle through all work opportunities from cleaning to making drinks to working with costumers at the cash register. I learned how to handle stressful costumers in a calm positive way and how to work with a different variety of people. "
good,"Great to start a job if you are a fresh graduate because they do not required work experience and also accepting working students as part timers. They have great culture. You will learn a lot. The Management is great. You will always update our knowledge and there is growth. Rustan Coffee gives us fair opportunities to grow. "
good,Easy job with critical. skills that will help you in the long run. flexible with school and second job as well. Highly  recommend for a first job or easy money on the side.
good,"I loved my experience at Starbucks. I ultimately decided to leave because i wasn't happy at my current store and my manager wouldn't let me transfer. Hours were flexible, pay was decent, benefits were AMAZING. I loved all my coworkers too which rocked."
good,"Starbucks taught me how to be quicker on my feet all while maintaining a positive attitude. "
good,"This company was great for me when I was starting off in the workforce, and I'm certain it is just as great for experienced workers who are "
good,"When working in the morning the environment is more fast paced and customer oriented. But towards the closing shifts, less business lead to more cleaning and prepping for the next day. Much more laid back and slow paced compared to morning shifts."
good,"I was in High School when I worked at Starbucks. It's not that hard to keep things clean, keep a clear level head when you've got dozens of drinks to male and as long as you have a positive attitude towards things, there's nothing that can make you upset."
good,Make sure to use the tools and resources given to you from the company to succeed. Learn how to work in multiple locations. Stay consistent with attendance and put lots of effort into each shift if you want to learn and grow.
good,"Its a cute place to work, not very difficult but management can be catty and you only get about 20 to 25 hours a week. if you're in school or are looking for a second job its a good fit!"
good,Starbucks over all is a great company with many useful benefits. The employees are friendly and helpful and as well as management. Making drinks for customers are very rewarding because building relationships with them is important. It gives them reason to come back and buy a drink with a smile on their face knowing they’ll expect friendly service.
good,"Fast paced, loyal customers, and the ability to build your career. Solid benefits and employee discounts. Lots of training to help you keep up with all the platform changes"
good,"Demanding, fast paced, a lot of memorizing, must work well in a team and with customers. must be able to create relationships with customers and your team."
good,"Working at Starbucks allows a person to get used to a fast-paced work environment. I loved working with my Starbucks partners, it was like going into work with a bunch of friends. I also enjoyed getting to know many of the regular customers."
good,"El clima era muy bueno, ya que todos contaban con la disposición de ayudar en la preparación o ante alguna duda, consulta. Asimismo, el ambiente con los clientes era muy dinámico, ya que todos tratan con confianza."
good,I had a wonderful experience working at Starbucks with such a diverse staff and friendly customers!
good,You can definitely be yourself. It's a great and fun working environment. VERY fast paced and high energy. Being a Barista is not for the weak at heart.
good,This job is very difficult you have to manage a lot at once but it’s a good job. Everyone gets along and the working environment is always great and there is never negativity.
good,"Atractivo ambiente para trabajar , promisiones, etc"
good,Great place to work with a lot of great benefits. Unfortunately we had a bad manager running our store but nothing was ever done to remedy the situation
good,"Overall, I enjoyed this job. It was non-stop problem solving and fast-paced customer service. I would always recommend Starbucks as a first job. It really tests your skill level in the different positions you're placed in and especially helps you learn time management."
good,"Starbucks is super busy (depending on location) and super stressful. Learning all the different drink recipies with new ones coming in every couple of months have been the most challenging. "
good,Lots of different people and easy work environment as long as you don't let yourself get taken in by stress of overworking for others who are loosely working. But great fun environment and lots of opportunities to relocate if you move or need to pick up hours.
good,Working at Starbucks was one of the most rewarding jobs. They have great benefits and they work with your schedule. I loved working there because I got to know the customers that came in everyday and after a certain point they became like family to us which made going to work every morning something I looked forward to.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for while attending college. Hours are flexible and benefits are great especially the 401k because they are 100 percent match.
good,"Lerning to make new drinks as a brista "
good,Starbucks is a well rounded company. They care about their employees and show it with their benefits and management performance. They strive to make their customers and their partners feel welcomed and appreciated.
good,the typical day at work is it can get very busy. what I learned from this job is the cultural difference and the knowledge of coffee. the management is managed okay. they could work on communication. the most enjoyable part of the job is all the good friends you make while working this job.
good,"I love my fellow baristas. This job is hard work and I end up sweating most days, but the warm and welcoming environment that the employees provide makes it all worth it. The benefits are outstanding, even for part-time workers. However, if you are not a shift supervisor, pay isn’t great."
good,The hardest part bout the job is dealing with the people with different personalities. The work environment is a good one fun and friendly. You will enjoy working for the company its its own small family.
good,The days usually consist of making coffee and food. I learned how to make drinks and prepare food which they go over in training. The one thing I personally did not like at Starbucks was the management at the time. The best part of the job was the coffee.
good,"Fun job but that’s all it is. A temporary job for a while, after a bit it gets overwhelming especially if you have managers or shift managers who don’t contribute much. I did make some great friends who were my coworkers or “partners”, but besides that it’s a pretty ok job. It mostly depends on your location, working in the biggest city in the world will test you and surprise you."
good,"You get along well with your coworkers, only downside is that the customers send back drinks all the time to take advantage of the drink guarantee. Highly recommend working here."
good,"While the pay isn't extraordinary, the amount of benefits and such that you get is amazing, especially as a part-time worker. Full time hours aren't required for most if not all benefits, and they will pay for an education so long as you work there. Mandatory breaks are standard, with a ten and thirty minute break required each shift over a certain number of hours."
good,"Great workplace, with overall positive employees and customers. Very friendly and welcoming environment allows people to dine comfortably and greatly increases the chance of them returning."
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work. There is constant customer engagement and an endless amount of work to be done. The compensation can not be matched although the dollar per hour is low. The company truly cares for its partners/employees but expects hard work in return.
good,I love working at Starbucks. The benefits are amazing. I love connecting with my customers and partners. Sometimes it gets a little crazy with mobile orders and big orders but we push through and smile to the end.
good,This was a good first job for me but at times the works could be made difficult by tensions between coworkers and manegers. This only really affected the vibe at starbucks but that is an important aspect to me.
good,"Starbucks was a fantastic job, management always considered your schedule when creating the work shifts. It was fast paced yet easy going and the clients were fun to work with as well."
good,"It was a good workplace, fast-paced and enjoyable. Training development is different for everyone. If looking for flexible hours, try and find a higher volume store with more employees."
good,"Particularly my store is great, we have amazing partners and a manager. For baristas ratio responsibility/salary is good, for supervisors, who get only 50p more per hour, there is a bit overweight towards responsibility."
good,"Through starbucks I was able to accomplish a nursing degree, while expanding my experience locally and more broadly. It's such a vast network of places. Every store/location is different all while attaining the same goals. You have the option of traveling to other local stores to help out and branch yourself. I've met more people in my life at starbucks than anywhere else, which I find extremely rewarding. Not only a work environment but a place you can go to enjoy the company of others. Whether it be your customers or your fellow partners.You really get to have a customer experience while having your own work experience that helps you to grow not only as a person, but as a barista and productive part of society. You attain life long skills and knowledge. Some days, surely can be more challenging than others, but your great days outshine those. Truly a place that wants to keep you and teach you."
good,The compensation was great along with other benefits that were bestowed upon me. I was able to manage with working at a flexible hour of the day and still had time to enjoy my outside of work life. I was promoted quickly and was able to adapt to the changes thanks to additional training tools.
good,I work in the mornings and have the rest of the day to either spend for myself or even to work at another jobs to make more to provide for myself. I can request time off and I usually and granted that time. I don’t have to worry about paying for healthcare all on my own because Starbucks helps!
good,"Great culture.  A lot of wonderful people.  Customer service is what it is, so keep that in mind.  You can definitely grow within the company, but have to try in order to do so."
good,"I loved the job, nothing made me happier than creating a beverage for someone that they loved. It was a great experience working there. I’d definitely still b employed there if it paid enough. The management at every location I worked at was amazing. I use to work in Middleton off of airport road, Milwaukee wi in the third ward and also the one off of Ogden. They were all great locations. Made the most tips at the Ogden location because 8n the third ward there are a lot of coffee shops down there so it wasn’t as busy at that location. Great discounts, you got 20% off anything in the store and free drinks and one free meal while you worked and two if you worked more than 8 hours I believe."
good,Starbucks had a great work environment and was a great experience for me. I really enjoyed working there. It was the first time I had worked as a Barista and in the food and drink field.
good,"Starbucks taught me how to be tolerant, patient and become a better team member. I learned so much about how to be a great customer service representative and how crucial it is to represent the company in a positive point of view. After being a Barista for three years I had the opportunity of being promoted to a supervisor. It has been a great experience being a leader in the store and exemplify the positive mission statement to my fellow partners."
good,Great place to work. you get to meet a lot of good people. I would love to stay here but looking for something more in my field of study. This is a great place to work if you are a teenager as well.
good,"While Starbucks is fast paced, it is a well-oiled machine that is fun to work in and is challenging. I thrive under pressure so it was an awesome first job in the ""real world,"" which strengthened my work effort long term. I work harder because of the things I learned at Starbucks. If one member of the team isn't working hard, you can tell a difference. Working on a team and doing your best helps everyone succeed, which I'm thankful I learned at Starbucks."
good,"There's plenty to learn about the customer service industry from the interactions you encounter on a daily basis. Some are UGLY and you will see the crazy side of human nature. While others are good and life changing relationships were created from these simple encounters. For those who wants to develop their customer service skills, I would definitely recommend Starbucks as a starting point for all, especially if it's a cafe store. Customers love chatting with their favorite barista over the little things. And it makes a difference for both parties in the long run."
good,"This was my first job out of high school, and it was a great way to get into the working world. Management varys from store to store, but my current manager is very supportive."
good,"Before becoming a partner at Starbucks, I dreamed of going to college. After working at Starbucks for 6 months, I was able to go back to school thanks to the College Achievement Plan that Starbucks offers. "
good,"I loved the Starbucks environment and culture.  We had a team of hardworking and dedicated employees, from managers to baristas.  Management was very hands on and approachable.  Any issues I had were address in a timely and professional manner.  "
good,"My co workers have respect and so fun to work with, and I met a lot of friends not just my co workers but also some costumers that I've served before !"
good,This was a good company to work for! Taught me a lot in and out of work. Just wish I could go back. I also had an issue with the store partner resources was always there to help with anything I needed.
good,"I worked there for 3 years and made some of my best lifelong friends in the process. Taught me a good deal of work ethic and how to cope with stress in the work place. The hourly pay could have been better, based on the sheer amount of physical labor (especially in morning shifts), but wasn't terrible. Good benefits, a 401k plan, stock shares in the company and even a college program with Arizona State University. Often a really fun job. Management varies, sometimes it's wonderful, sometimes quite the opposite. It just depends on the store really. You get a free meal (one food item) each shift you work, and an unlimited number of free beverages (you usually don't have time for very many though), while you're on the clock, as well as a %30 discount when you're not working."
good,Great mission. Good manager. Flexible scheduling. comprehensive and paid training. Great benefits. Free drinks! They are really good at making work stay at work.
good,The people you work with make that job amazing and the management staff are very understanding and relate to there employees struggles. great job for students or people between jobs or looking for a second job.
good,"Starbucks really goes out of their way to produce an accepting, open culture in their business. The free coffee helped, and management was excellent, and they really take care of their employees (""partners"" in Starbucks jargon) in a way that is uncommon in jobs of this level. While all jobs in the fast food service industry have their pitfalls, Starbucks has done more than most others to mitigate these problems. Starbucks offers a diverse variety of incentives and bonuses from discounted stock options to college discounts, while also giving regularly paid training on diversity and inclusion. They also give you many opportunities for advancement and promotion, or even just adding extra hours at other locations. I was lucky to have worked with the best manager in the district, many other stores suffered from being understaffed, but my store was always in the best possible configuration. I enjoyed having new challenges and problems to solve every shift. It was sometimes even fun figuring out logistics and optimization of the store. Ultimately, as my college years come to a close, I am searching for something that i can use my degree for. Starbucks is a really great place to work, and had I not earned a bachelors degree, I would certainly consider continuing to work for this company."
good,"As I worked for my time there, the typical day at work was fast paced, helping customers, making the moment right, and assisting our fellow workers. One may learn quite a bit from working a fast food job here and mainly oneself would find that their fellow workers make the day better. The hardest part of the job depends on one's own interests and capabilities."
good,You have to constantly make sure every customer is satisfied. Always provide good customer service at all times. I love making people smile and making them feel welcomed.
good,"My store manager is very accommodating an provides a lot of support to the team. Upper and middle management are weak and are causing a culture decline in the whole company. While at the store level, culture is great."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work with benefits for part time employment. It is fast paced especially during peak hours, and there are a lot of steps to remember, but the training is great."
good,"I personally enjoyed working at Starbucks, the environment is very welcoming and hip. The dress code is very accepting to tattoos and things a lot of places aren’t typically okay with.  It is really nice to see as a company the fact they are very excepting of expressive personalities. The pay isn’t the best because it is a food service job but I still appreciate my time I was there."
good,Can be a really stressful job if you are hard on yourself. But after getting the hang of things it is a really good job making customer connections. Starbucks is a welcoming place of work.
good,this work enviorment was not for me. It was just a placeholder until I found a better job. Coming from the military to work at starbucks was not ideal for me due to it feeling like a major down grade.
good,"Fun place to work, Lots of nice customers and coworkers. I learned how to make coffee. The hardest part was repetitive motion. The most enjoyable was the community of workers and customers."
good,"If you like working in a fast pace environment, Starbucks is definitely the place to work. It has so many different options for customers. Your day will never be boring!"
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for! They work with your schedule, provided great benefits, and free coffee is just one of the many other perks. I've been a barista trainer for about two years now and my favorite part of the job are the people."
good,"Positive and great team with many locals knowing each other. "
good,"Just like most organizations, one's experience is a blend of many contributing factors. Most importantly for me was the strength and confidence of my leadership. I grew very fond of most of my leadership and many of them continue as personal mentors. Starbucks is a special company, or at least it was during my employment. While I am not much for the retail game anymore, I would highly recommend the experience. I learned a lot."
good,"You get a lot of benefits for a simple job. However, I do not think the baristas are paid enough. "
good,They will pay for your college! Work was consistently busy from the time I got there until the time I left. I had a great training experience and picked up the job quickly.
good,i bonded with my co workers so quickly and they became a 2nd family to me. everyone is always joking around with one another and that makes working at starbucks so exciting. you always want to come back for more. the hardest part is just dealing with rude customers.
good,"Fast paced environment with the need to multitask & connect with customers while serving people food and drink in a timely manor. Overall, Starbucks is a good part time job."
good,"Starbucks was a good career while I was in school. Pay was good, received benefits, work incentives, discounts, and if I had chosen, the company provides scholarships to employees employed for a certain amount of time"
good,"A great company to work for who actively seek to ensure all staff members are happy at work. The job is very sales orientated, therefore it is essentially that you have a passion for sales to be succesfull in your role."
good,"A big part of the neighborhood, and a great place to grow. Plenty of options for every partner hired. Discounts are a PLUS! Workplace culture directed as a team."
good,The work at Starbucks was rewarding and fun. There was never a dull moment and the work felt both competitive and fulfilling. The management was steller and I would highly recommend it to a friend.
good,I loved my team members and managers. Starbucks is a great job and very flexible with your schedule. It can be stressful but the team environment makes it fun.
good,"Working for Starbucks was a dream. I built close bonds with both my colleagues as well as the customers. I learned a variety of new skills, which I still apply in my day-to-day life."
good,I was great to work on campus with a lot of student benefits like textbook discounts and food and drinks discounts. Students and other employees were super nice to work with.
good,Starbucks has been really good to me. For the most part I enjoyed the time I spent there because of the positive work environment. They have decent pay and benefits. However it is not something I could do for the rest of my life. After 4 years I got burnt out on the same thing. I dislike the company wide pay raises instead of doing individual raises. Great place to be for me while I was getting through school. I also met a lot of wonderful people and learned many valuable skills.
good,"From my experience, everyone I work with is chill and respectful and most customers are nice and appreciative. There’s a certain stigma about people that work at Starbucks being stuck up but that’s absolutely untrue. All my co workers in NJ and CA are extremely down to earth, sweet people who want nothing but the best for their Starbucks family and the people they serve."
good,I learned that being a barista takes a lot of multitasking and stamina to be handle to keep a smile on even when in a rush or focusing on more than one task at a time. My days at starbucks were always enjoyable especially because of my co workers at that time.
good,I enjoyed my regular customers and keeping up with them. My manager worked with my school schedule very well and gave me the time off when I needed it.
good,"It was a good experience, my team worked well together. The pay wasn't great considering the area i live in but overall it was good. I have heard they are doing a lot of amazing things and i wish them the best."
good,"Monotonous work days"
good,"I think Starbucks is  a great place to start when thinking of entry level jobs. Like with everything else, I do think there is room for improvement, especially when it comes to management and new initiatives, but if you can handle a fast-paced and changing environment, then I think you'll enjoy working for this company. It can also be easy to get along with other partners, but it's best to ensure that your work is the priority."
good,"Due to the location of this Starbucks, a higher level of customer care and job proficiency is expected. This is an affluent community and can be highly specific and demanding of the workers"
good,"All co-workers are fun and welcoming to any new employee. Very fast paced work environment. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a fun, rewarding job."
good,"it has its pros and cons like every job but they accommodate your schedule. you become apart of a community. working there becomes like a second home.second nature, it becomes enjoyable to work their IF you are suit for the job. Not everybody has the skill, i feel like .. to be a barista. But there is always the weakest and strongest of the bunch. Everybody finds their place within the company, and thats what i like about it most."
good,Starbucks allows a thriving multicultural community. It also challenges you to develop well under high pressure without compromising quality. Also teaches you how to interact with cranky clients all day.
good,Working at Starbucks is a great opportunity. There are lots of opportunities for advancements within the company. Although some of customers requests can be a little crazy- we all work together to make it a good day.
good,"the moment one is clocked in, customer and coworker welcome you. one gets to meet new people. the best part of working with starbucks is meeting new people from over the world."
good,"Working at starbucks, there is no time to relax. Depending on who your manager is, if you become overwhelmed you should be able to get a 10 minute pause. Working there can make you overwhelmed quickly but you have to get used to it, especially if you are put on the drive through. You'll be running back and forth through the kitchen and the back gathering items while trying to remember what the person in your ear is ordering... But they pay well so its worth it... for some people."
good,during the time I worked for starbucks I had received multiple promotions the weekends was extremely busy because we were a tourist store but it was worth it.
good,"A typical day at starbucks is very busy . i love meet new and diverse people everyday . Everyday was different , always something to do . There was always a goal to meet, always on your toes."
good,"Working at Starbucks it is hard to find a balance of what needs to be done in a timely manner and also keeping the baristas and customers happy, but when you do the job is exceptionaly rewarding. I love that I have challanges every day like, how to go above and beyond for someone, or how do I manage the safety, speed, and cleanliness of the overall store. It is an awsome feeling having an out the window time that is beyond the companies standards and also having a store customer service score that is one of the highest in our district. I also love communicating and finding new ways to challenge my baristas."
good,"I love making coffee and taking time to have a nice conversation with the customers. The only problem that it is stressful during rush hours because of all the shift supervisors yelling at their baristas. Sometimes they would stress them out and make them cry. Another thing was that it gets super fast paced and stressful that one time, one of the supervisors dropped coffee on my my face and all over my body when I was crouching down to get something. A lot of bullying is happening in our specific store but when it comes to the whole business its great. Great management, amazing benefits, etc."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. They pay you decently and have amazing benefits including, free stock, tuition  reimbursement, free drinks and food, health insurance, and much more. The people working there are really nice and the environment is amazing."
good,It was great while I was in school. A lot of young people work there. Every location is different and so was my experience. I had issues with some managers but than I would just transfer with no issues.
good,I enjoyed working there. The coffee was good and the benefits were good as well. I enjoyed the people there and never had any complainants with my co workers.
good,depending on if you open or close your day can start pretty different. in the morning you set up the pastry case as people and mobile orders start coming in and this is usually pretty steady for the whole morning shift. afternoon and morning shifts are a bit slower with some busy time.
good,"Starbucks was a job that gave me a lot of real world experience in the hospitality field. Although I wasn't there as long as I wished I was, I still made sure to grasp as much as I could."
good,love the customers and loved working for the company amazing overall enjoyed being apart of the Starbucks group and looking forward to be apart of it again
good,It was a fun company to wok for. It was a very fast pace and memorization was key. Friendly environment and awesome partners to work with. Making the perfect drink to the customer to enjoy was the best feeling.
good,"would recommend to anyone, especially teenagers and college students that enjoy jobs to be more fast paced typically. The pay is fair, in my experience and fro what I have heard."
good,Overall a great job for someone who is young or in college. I do not recommend this job if you are trying to support yourself or live on your own. Pay is not enough but great benefits and flexible
good,"Learned how to multi-task without compromising on product quality or customer service. Decent management, but shift supervisors are inconsistent and some lack leadership skills. Most enjoyable part of the job was the rewarding feeling of making it through a stressful part of the shift. Good culture and positive environment."
good,"Though i was only with Starbucks for seven months I completely enjoyed my time there. It was a little hard to get a hang of all of the routines and structure but after a ,month or so everything came a lot easier. I really appreciate the environment that is created throughout the whole company."
good,"Muy entretenido, aprendí muchas cosas, el amor por ser barista pero creo que el espíritu y la atención de starbucks hoy en día ha bajado mucha su calidad en cuanto a los baristas que están ahora, pero fue como mi primer trabajo serio y fue una bonita experiencia."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for for a short period of time. There is a great balance with work and life but the management can sometimes be an issue. I have worked at multiple locations and can say that with confidence.
good,My job was within a grocery store that was associated with Starbucks. I'm sure working with an actual Starbucks is much better as my main complaint working in a grocery store was that there was no room for personal schedule.
good,"- Enjoy interacting with customers willing to chat,"
good,"I was in a stand alone store, and we have to strict rules to follow.  Your supervisor and managers will make the biggest difference.  The company has a good culture and who can say no to free drink during your shift and discounts when you are not?"
good,"Starbucks is very centered around their mission statement and tries to make it a “Third Place” for its customers. Its fun to work here and the company give many perks to the partners (tuition reimbursement, health care, free spotify account, etc) But it’s becoming a top-down company and not really listening to what the workers say but more what management says goes."
good,I liked how quick paced it was and the co workers were so caring and relatable. I enjoyed my time at starbucks getting to know customers and their orders. I would recommend this job to a friend.
good,"good place to work, with great training given. fast pace environment at times but skills learnt will be able to be used in any job. you can build on confidence in your role"
good,"I was at one of the busiest stores in the area, and the job proved to be too high stress for what I needed. I loved the people I worked with though, and the company itself is wonderful!"
good,"As far as customer services jobs go, working at Starbucks has been one of the more enjoyable ones. The company encourages its employees to learn about what they're doing and to get excited over the product that they are making."
good,Great place to work. Great benefits.you get unlimited free drinks and one free food item during break. At the end of the day workers get to leave with lots of left over which is always good
good,"I have only worked a couple months at Starbucks but what I can say is it is very fast paced. However, the team is amazing in backing each other up because of the way the company sets up team roles."
good,I enjoyed my time at the company. Fun place for people who like to work hard. Great benefits. Fast pace job...........................................
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for. You will learn and develop a lot from working here. It can be stressful at times but I do think it's worth your time if your looking to gain good experience.
good,"Customer service at a prestigious company with excellent brand recognition that is rewarding through a wide range of benefits, affordable insurance, and a daily perks. An eight hour shift will often fly by as you will be frequently engaged with customers, side work, and low impact tasks."
good,"productive and fun. felt belong and welcome during my working days, take care of, good benefits and great culture"
good,Typical day at work includes reviewing of basic product knowledge. Greeting costumers and ensuring costumer satisfaction by helping co-partners with their store project.
good,"Personally, the company itself is a  nice place to work but I worked for HMSHOST and wasn't fun! They are not that organized when comes to putting the right manager at the right location. Other than that, it was an excellent work experience!"
good,Loved working here. Fast paced and something different everyday! The customers were all different and i enjoy meeting people from all different walks of life. Would work here again!
good,"Nice place to work, fast paced and demanding. You get some nice perks if you capitalize on them. Good for a part-time position if you're in school or a new graduate."
good,"This company is so fantastic. I loved being a barista, the benefits are great, so many perks, and everyone was relatively friendly! I probably would not have quit working for them if 1) I didn't have to drive so far and 2) old lady co-workers were forcing me to lift heavy things when I was pregnant because I'm younger than them.. I complained about it to my manager and I thought she was going to speak to them about it but nothing changed, and I ended up being really dizzy and sick on the job a lot because of the strain it was putting on my body."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. My manager was great, other team members were great, free drinks and food. It could be stressful at times and obviously busy."
good,"Nice and rigid for people who like that sort of thing, can be a shock to osme people but they get stuff done in a timely manner and are very friendly and helpful for the most part"
good,"In busy days time run away, in not busy - it is a little bit boring. You always will have opportunity to try all units and have new skills each day. I have learned to resolve problems positively and manage with my emotions."
good,"Because of the pay scale, this is good for a beginning job. Because of benefits, this job is good for retirees. I came to appreciate the strict abidance with Starbucks policies and structure as it made it easier to move between stores and feel comfortable knowing that the policies are basically the same."
good,I really enjoy working for the company I've been working with Starbucks for 3 years now.  I would really recommend this company to everyone that loves customer service.
good,Your working a low paying entry level job with great benefits. the best or worst part of the job is the co-workers that is what makes and breaks the environment.
good,"If i didn't need to make more money, maybe i'd stay.  Lots of awesome people that i work with, but I have things to pay for and the hourly pay at Starbucks doesn't pay the bills."
good,"Working at Starbucks is a crash course in learning to work with various kinds of people. I would say that during morning rush it can get pretty stressful, with a line out the door and mobile orders piling up it takes a good team to navigate the rush. The most enjoyable part of the job is connecting with customers, sometimes we're the first people they talk to in the morning so having a good interaction with them by remembering their names or coffee orders or even recommending something new fosters those positive relationships."
good,"Always on the move, always on the go. Starbucks is a fast pace but personal place to work. Making sure all customers get a great experience no matter how slow or how busy the day is. My management team goes above and beyond to make sure everything runs as smoothly as possible no matter what they have on their plate that day. Everyone is very helpful and always tries to be a team player. working so closely with other partners makes the job a little easer because you sort of become a family and are able to connect with each other on a deeper level. Working at a fast pace environment does take a toll on your energy levels at the end of the day but working in our caring environment makes it worth it."
good,It's cool but not my career. It's been a great job to have while I'm in college and need time off for school. I wish it was a little more hip but it is what it is.
good,"Starbucks is a place that I will forever feel comfortable at. I feel like I was given the opportunity to become an amazing, reliable and hard working partner while advancing my skills to a Management position in the company. The only downside is that it is very hard to seemingly advance as far as I would like to. The transition from retail Starbucks to corporate Starbucks was one that I had hoped and applied for many times but couldn't attain which is why I left the company"
good,"I was fortunate enough to have a really wonderful store manager who was very strict with her training simply because she wanted each of her team members at there best. She was funny, down to earth,fair in every since of the word and just an overall pleasure to work with. Wonderful store great location at fashion island. A good experience all the way around."
good,"Great experience to network with other employees. Great benefits.  Coffee culture is so unique, and it has been a pleasure to learn and share my knowledge."
good,i loved working at Starbucks but its hard to move up thats why i left 4 almost 5 years ago. the management was always amazing and understanding. the energy was always kept high and full of smiles. the hardest part of the job was the changing hours every week/day. the best part of the job was taking someone who came into the store grumpy and leaving them with a smile just by making them a cup of coffee. lastly it is crazy how much of a passion coworkers and myself had for coffee. you become obsessed when you work with it every day.
good,My manager was amazing. There was only part-time work available. Peak hours could be very fast paced and everyone needed to work together to have a successful shift.
good,"I think Starbucks has a lot to offer their employees, especially the health benefits that are offered for part tome employees. I do wish that it did not change to being so corporate and let the environment become somewhat uptight and rigid for the employees as well as the patrons."
good,I learned a lot and got to make many drinks. I also got a discount on some of the drinks that I purchased. They provide a lot of training and are flexible with your schedule.
good,"The job has it's bad days but Overall a good Company to Work for that cares for their employees, most of the co-workers are laid back and fun, customers (regulars) can be interesting."
good,"Starbucks has a very good training program and gives you great opportunities to move up from a Barista to a Shift Supervisor. If you wish ,the opportunity to enter Store management is available however you must express this wish. The money you make per hour is very good as well as having great benefits . I love the fact that you are able to connect with customers and in the community. I have worked for Starbucks for 20 years and I have recommend the company to many people who have asked."
good,"Nice place to work, its a good place to work for students or for your first job. You meet new people , socialize , make new friends. The job is pretty fast-paced so you have to be okay with constant movement and the pressure of line rushes and other things. Taking out the trash sucks ewww lol. Get to try out new drinks and food items."
good,"Great job, bosses are understanding and accommodating to life schedule. Everyone is super friendly and easy to talk to/ask questions. Learn A LOT about coffee and tea. The morning and afternoon rushes can be challenging for new partners, lots of drinks to make super quickly, but other staff is very helpful. Lots to learn, but once you know it, you know it. Great place to learn/ improve customer service skills and communication abilities. Its nice to be able to bring a smile to a customer's face"
good,Amazing benefits and perks with flexible hours makes it perfect for a college student. Shift Supervisor provides excellent management experience to take with you. Promoting up past a shift supervisor within the company can be exceedingly challenging and competitive.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is usually a busy one, but one that is strangely fun. You meet many different types of people and the people I work with are the best kinds in my opinion. I learned a lot from my coworkers, and have grown so much more experience with remembering certain recipes, and names of returning customers. I love the overall attitude within Starbucks because its always so focused on the customers and getting the job done. It can be difficult in the beginning to learn all the drinks or see so many people, remembering not only their name, but their drink too. But my coworkers were always there to help and guide me along, teaching me all they knew and giving me constructive criticism when I needed it. The people are what make Starbucks great."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks Canada, really flexible great team and management. It was a great job to have while in university with great benefits and flexible hours."
good,"En este puesto pude aprender la operación de la tienda, fue encargado de inventarios, caja, bebidas y del entrenamiento de los nuevos baristas."
good,"Loved it, great culture and a wonderful learning experience for service. Lots of great people as well. Would absolutely recommend if you are given the opportunity."
good,I was all for this survey until I had to actually write something. I don't actually have time to fill this out. I already answered all the questions. It's a good part-time place to work.
good,my first job taught me how to be responsible and a hard attentive worker. team work and sometimes great clientele. lots of meeting we are kept in the loop of things.
good,Busy day making drinks dealing with customers. machines have not been working. Usually we are out of some food items or drinks and people get upset. The hardest part of the job is when we run out of stuff and when our machines aren't working. The best part is seeing coworkers and making customers day.
good,"When I worked at Starbucks, I had a great team. We helped each other out and everyone did their part. The customers appreciated our efforts in creating a welcoming environment and in how we would remember their names, the way that they liked their drinks etc."
good,"A really good first job, team is always fun, management could be better.. although, the company itself is absolutely amazing. Training is very formal and informative."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, the people were always amazing at both locations I worked (in MT and MO). Unlimited free drinks while you are on the clock. I was mostly an opener and worked through the peak (most busiest time) and my days would fly by. Being on bar (making beverages) was by far my favorite. Offering amazing customer service and seeing the regulars everyday was a good way to come out of my shell and be more outgoing, customers can make your day!"
good,"I loved working as a barista, it was challenging at first but you get the hang of it. I loved my manager and coworkers but when my manager quit the new manager was out to get me! I am trying to get rehired after quitting but it is very difficult, I wonder if it is because I am in school, not really sure. I would love to work for this company again."
good,"great pace place to work at. great staff, great manger, great customers. great energy. always a happy place to walk into. always a relaxing environment."
good,It was like a big family to work with. I was able to make connections with both the customers as well as my co-workers. It made the work easy and fun.
good,"It is a great place to work . Depending if you have a great team which i did. It can be a slow day  and there are days which it's non stop. Your hours will change weekly . It's not really steady. it can go from 20-30 hours a week. You learn alot about the coffee. You learn alot about how to do drinks. It's like being a bartender. Alot of rules and cleaning. Customers are cool, but it all depends. Great benefits but you really can't live on the salary which i think is more important. Overall it's a pit-stop. But it's great for people who want a free college which they help and  if you are just looking for a part-time job."
good,"I appreciate the regulated procedures and policies for operating the cafe. I really enjoy the playbook to ensure efficiency and accuracy during our peak hours. The workplace culture is awesome! I love dressing casual and being able to wear my nose ring. With new seasonal drinks, and seasoned customers-- I am always learning new things."
good,"As Starbucks was my first official job after graduating high school, I couldn't have been given a better opportunity to better myself through this amazing company. The store I stayed in for over three years provided me with that opportunity, not only to advance myself through the ranks, but to also go to school as I needed."
good,"i love my job , great networking experience. fun fast friendly . employees are nice . the hardest part of the job is during a rush and cleaning the restrooms and floors"
good,Great place to work but you dont get many hours so part time is ideal and wouldnt recomend if this is your primary source of income! howevere fun place to learn and accomplish goals
good,Es muy padre trabajar ahí ya que conoces cosas nuevas y mucho más profesionales como es la cultura del café y té
good,"There will always be certain things that get on your nerves in a workplace, but overall I really enjoyed the work, people, and friendships I made at my location. I learned a lot about coffee and people. The management was a bit passive in places, but I know she did her best. the hardest part of the job was getting up early. The best part was definitely the partner perks on the products."
good,"Siempre era padre poder conocer a los clientes, se crea una relación de armonía tanto con los empleados junto con los clientes"
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. I would've loved to continue working there, but I came across another opportunity that was more beneficial to my career path."
good,"working for starbucks, i enjoyed it a lot. Overall it was a great job and I learned so much, the only complaint that i had about working here was: they should pay more attention to employee advice/suggestions."
good,Overall it’s a great place to work.  Pay could be better considering cost of living. Team environment and supportive management team. Always room for growth
good,Mainly working the PM shift. Closing duties. Managing employees. Working through major rush traffic. Excelling when it came to private shoppers who graded their experience. It was fun working with so many youthful people.
good,"It was a nice bisy working enviornment , Met alot if different nationalitys and became friends outside of work . The best part was making the drinks & seeing the customers happy and satisfied ."
good,"Is easy to move up within the company and your manager will work the best that they can with your schedule. Good benefits, plus stock options. They tend to up the price on coffee when its not needed, but at their core they care about the partners that work there"
good,"Excellent place to work with plenty of room for advancement, well above average benefits package and incentives.  Work - life balance can be a little challenging with the hours of operation."
good,An excellent place to start a career either with the company or elsewhere.  The work can be challenging as you need to perform multiple tasks in any of their positions.  Must have a friendly disposition and above standard work ethic.
good,"Working at Starbucks has been a great experience for me. Being an extrovert person I love meeting new people and through starbucks that has been possible. Every one out there is so supportive and open-minded. My work is basically at the front as a cashier like greeting customer, taking their orders, and serving them coffee."
good,"Each store has a different environment. The store I work at acts like a large family and look out for each other. The benefits are really nice, and the hours are flexible."
good,"definitely my favorite place to have worked, the managers actually helped workers through the day and even when closing. the workers were very kind and the customers were always respectful."
good,"My employment with Starbucks is still my best place of employment. I enjoyed the benefits, the flexibility and the opportunity of job growth that is offered within the company."
good,It’s super quick paced and can be tiring but also extremely fun good pay and medical coverage. Discounts on iteams and free drinks for employees so ideal place
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. They offer great benefits, a diverse environment, and lots of partner support. The pay is low though. The hardest part of the job is the fast pace. I learned a lot about time management, delegation, customer service, cash management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customer interaction."
good,Starbucks est une très belle place pour se développer.
good,"I had a wonderful management staff that I worked for.  The store itself is an extremely busy place, a bit high stress and fast paced especially during peak times."
good,"Was super relaxed and fun place to work. Had the luxury of working for a good friend, though. Drink as much coffee as you want for free, get good benefits if you're full time, get cash tips at the end of the week, work for a Fortune 500 company... Could be a lot worst."
good,"My first week at Starbucks was great when I met all the employees, it was nice and refreshing to work in an environment where everyone was so friendly, helpful, and most important to me at the time, was being patient. I mainly stuck to working on the register and handling the food and coffee, and practiced making lattes when it was slow. Management was great and very helpful when I needed help, and the best part of the job was talking to the customers that came in. Hardest part of the job for me was just remembering certain ingredients for drinks, but that was only because I was there for a short time. At times it also felt stressful when the line was going out the door but the way the work place was set up, everyone was very collaborative and made the process easier for all of us."
good,I love working here and at my store especially because it's the most fast paced around. I work well under the stress and excel greatly at my job. The manager is absolutely amazing. The most enjoyable thing about my job is that my coworkers appreciate each other. The hardest is that it's not the easiest to promote but it's possible.
good,Amazing and competitive place to work. Helped spark revenue through sales and make connections with regular customers. Learned about new coffee with weekly coffee tastings. Really positive workplace culture.
good,"I worked for this company for many years. I feel that if you are willing to put in the hard work and would like to receive amazing benefits, then this is a great job for you."
good,Working at Starbucks you learn that you can't please everyone even though you try your best. There will always be unhappy customers regardless if it's about what they order or they could be having a bad day. I did learn that teamwork makes the dream work.
good,"I worked in the busiest store in our district with a drive-thru and large lobby. There was a high turnover rate because we didn't have enough experienced baristas who could handle the weekend rushes and large customer base. However, management was always very organized and the company has great benefits and opportunity for advancement."
good,"Easy going people, understandable boss regarding mental health and identity."
good,"Starbucks is truly a great company to work for. While there is room for improvement in any company, Starbucks is better in many areas. Yes, you do have to work hard and you are on your feet all day. But Starbucks pays a little over the minimum wage to start. It also has so many benefits, much more than any other part-time position. For working only twenty hours a week, you are eligible for full benefits and even tuition reimbursement! The schedule is very flexible! The best part about Starbucks is that the culture is one of forgiveness! It is ok to make mistakes. You are always shown opportunities to learn and grow. It has taught me so much about patience and myself."
good,"Free coffee, dental, vision, and health plans even while part time. Work pace can be fast or slow depending on the time of day. Co-workers were extremely nice. Work around your school schedule."
good,"It was a great experience to encounter with people at this workplace, and it also helps me to learn about how food-chained restaurants' day-to-day operation."
good,got to meet alot of new people and famous people.  store was always clean and customer service was outstanding.  work staff was very helpful and was very knowledgeable.
good,"excelente cultura  sobre el cafe. clima  laboral muy bueno,  valoran mucho tanto al cliente  como al  empleado.. buena metodologia de capacitacion para  la induccion  para ser  barista,   una empresa muy buena en todo nivel , lastima  que la actividad  se vuelva  monotona y rutinaria.. por que  exigen  mucha rapidez para la atencion del cliente"
good,"You get free drinks every shift! and 1 free food item a day!"
good,A very well managed company where every staffs are equally respected and trained well. Diversified work group working together in a fun filled environment with common goals.
good,"i really love my job as a barista at starbucks because i love coffee. besides that, i am very happy to serve customer with their favourite beverage. the smell of the coffee at my workplace also is very nice"
good,Working for Starbucks is a fast-paced working environment. There is always a line of customers waiting to be served with coffee. I love working for Starbucks because my day goes by quick.
good,"Quality place to work, opportunity to grow. Diverse. Hardest part of the job was mopping the floors, cleaning the restrooms, and taking out the trash."
good,starbucks employees are by far the most underrated people. they go through heck and back and are always wonderful to get along with. they've seen things that cannot be unseen.
good,"I found it to be tough in the beginning, very fast-paced and demanding, but the partners quickly became family, all of the regulars became a part of everyday, and the job got easier with practice and some dedication, and the whole experience became more fun."
good,Excellente compagnie où l'employé à la possibilité de développer différentes compétences en gestion.
good,"It's what you'd expect a service job to be.  Overall, the people are friendly.  Surprisingly they offer great benefits if you work 20 hours a week or more.   Benefits are affordable on part time pay-- but only if you don't need to also pay bills with your pay."
good,Fun work environment and positive people working together. Health benefits as well as support from partners and the company. Recommended for a part-time job.
good,"Loved the people, flexible hours, Great medical and dental benefits available. Lots of opportunities to advance. Very busy during peak hours especially during the holidays. The first month was the hardest as there is so much to know ut once you get it, its a breeze."
good,"Working at Starbucks has been a good work environment for me. One needs to team focused, and prepared to work fast paced environment. Learning the drinks can seem intimidating at first but, most them are formula, step-by-step, based when its broken down."
good,"Starbucks is an incredible company to work for, and the job is by no means difficult so long as you work hard and efficiently. It is fast-paced, so if you are a more relaxed person then I would advise another job. I have a lot of fun making connections with other partners and customers. I would say the hardest part of the job is when a system is unavailable or when customers get upset. The easiest way to not let those things get to you is not to take it so personally."
good,This is a great job to hone in on your skill set of multi-tasking under pressure. It is a fairly fast paced job that requires 90% of the day spent on your feet running back and forth around the shop.
good,"I worked at Starbucks for 5 years. Great Corporate Responsibility, awesome options for advancement for staff and great benefits for everyone that works there."
good,"I never had anything bad to say about the company, I loved working for them and loved what the company stood for! The only problem I had was new management and that is why I left the company."
good,"great company to work for, amazing culture and inclusion. Plenty of room for growth along with many benefits. Along with medical and dental for part time workers there is College Achievement, 401k and Stock options offered to every employee."
good,"Starbucks has excellent benefits, great culture, and lots of room to advance or relocate. Downside would be retail hours to include holidays and early mornings. If you are looking for a 9 to 5 then this is not for you but that is all retail not just Starbucks. Aside from the hours I believe Starbucks to be a great opportunity. Benefits are available with a minimum of 20 hours per week and the customers and employees are generally great people."
good,I joined the Starbucks team almost 6 months ago and I like the atmosphere of my workplace. All the partners are very helpful and you can rely on them if you have a question. Our team goal is to give our best service to our guest by greeting them properly and making their drinks right.
good,Overall it was a very good environment. The people who worked there knew their craft and cared about what they did. I learned plenty while working there and I'm glad I had the experience.
good,Very fast paced and stressful at times. I learned a great deal about different coffee processing methods and profiles. The atmosphere is generally very electric and alive with fun baristas.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. The company continues to have a strong culture where people (partners) are valued. Pay and benefits are good, but tough to compete with some of the other large employers in the Seattle area."
good,"Starbucks was a great place for me to be able to work. I learned much about myself and what it took to succeed in the retail world. This job had it's ups and downs, but I still do find myself wishing I could go back and work there (for just a day)."
good,"Good first time job"
good,"Very fast paced environment with good work ethic from the employees. Customer interaction is key and making sure that every experience they encounter is a good one, The hardest part of the job would be all the cleaning the job entails and there is now slacking off which makes the time of your shift go by fast. Management is always willing to help were ever needed, but always ensures to enforce policies."
good,Starbucks is not for the weak-hearted. You must have excellent multi-tasking skills and take criticism and customer complaints well. Most enjoyable part of the job are the benefits.
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 4 years and I honestly loved it. It was fun, always different, and you get to meet some amazing people. If you want a fast paced job with cool benefits this ones for you !"
good,"It's a quick paced friendly atmosphere that works well with customers and tries to brighten their day. That is the mission but in reality the shifts are staffed to the minimum so that they get as much profit as possible. Due to that expectations are above realistic ability, without being able to run as fast as superman. Other than expecting partners to move faster than an Olympic sprinter the work is moderate though does require heavy lifting, vast item recipe memorization and janitorial duties."
good,"Very fun environment to work in, learned to speed my pace up. learned  to handle money matters. loved meeting new people and learning so much about them."
good,Starbucks has great customers who come in everyday & you might even know they order before they get to the register. Also you'll have good team members who will help you even if you not struggling.
good,"the company overall is good, they care a lot about their workers. but if you cant handle pressure or think right under pressure, this job is not for you. if you stay focused and respectful under pressure, then is for you."
good,It's a great company to work for. There are tons of benefits with Starbucks. It serves as a great part time job. Management is fantastic at my location. They really take care of their baristas and excel at performing their managerial duties. I really enjoy the people I work with.
good,"Always having fun working here and i absolutely loved it but a few stores have recently closed down in our area and the staff were treated badly and just thrown in any stores without asking them, progression past supervisor is also quite hard due to lack of jobs."
good,Starbucks brings a variety of different astonishment throughout the customers day.The conversations in the workplace are remarkable. I would say the hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on your face an always take the high road an be the solution right or wrong . The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customer with delightful drinks and engaging in learning new drinks. The experience you get doing this job is eye opening an a learning tool for workers outside of work life .i l love Starbucks.
good,"I love this job! I started my work life as a barista, and when I was looking for a change of pace decided to return to my roots!! I love the culture, and feel as though I'm learning so much more about coffee than I knew before, and there are great opportunities for growth and development. Also the benefits are all they are cracked up to be!!"
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks and creating drinks to satisfy the customers. I liked the fast-paced environment as well! The only thing I struggled with at the time was the constant shift changes.
good,"A typical day at work was waking up at 3:30am, getting to work by 4:30am, setting up, brewing coffee, and helping customers. I learned the importance of working at a fast pace, and balancing many different tasks. Management was flexible, and held me to a high standard. The culture at Starbucks is very warm, friendly, and comfortable. The hardest part of the job was balancing many different tasks at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with customers and getting to know them on a personal level."
good,Amazing benefits and great people to work with. Customers service is the most important thing at Starbucks. Daily customer treat you as you treat them.
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, buenas prestaciones y son cocientes en cuanto respecta al trato del trabajador"
good,A very fun and energetic work environment. While the pay is not amazing the job is laid back and the customer's are great. Benefits are also very good and potential to move up in the company is realistic.
good,When i first started working here it was great but that chnaged .They started to hire too much people so there isn't enough hours .Apparently because kids are out of school we have no money coming im .Also whem you work a 5 hour or 6 hour shift no 30 minute break only a 10 .Your feet are in soo mich pain its crazy
good,"Working at Starbucks was like working your dream job. The pay is great, the standards are amazing and the people are just as great. working here i learned everything from making signature drinks to creating new ones. Working here was as much fun as I have ever had working at a place like this."
good,"Learning about coffee, getting to know regular customers and keeping them coming back are such rewarding parts to this job. Working at a drive-thru store really cuts that experience down due to the amount of business you get, I would highly recommend a cafe store for those who want a job that gives great benefits and teaches you about coffee."
good,Very diverse place to work. always on front edge. Great place to there guest both internal and external. Would probably be still employed if I did not have a medical emergency.
good,"This job is great way to develop skills in customer service, leadership and multi-tasking. It begins as a great challenge, but always has room for growth."
good,Every day is always something new. Sometimes it can be a little stressful but it always fun. I've learned a lot about the management side of the company and how to interact with many different people. The environment at Starbucks is a lot of fun but there are a lot of teenagers so sometimes it feels like I'm back in high school which I don't like. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with people who are upset and making sure you say everything the correct was so no offence is taken. I absolutely love the relationships that are created within the company and the day to day interactions. The company has great values ans goals i just feel we are expected to do so much for very little. I on a daily basis am expected to do high level management tasks when I do not get paid as much as a high level manager.
good,I've love working at Starbucks since the day I started. Mostly every employee reflect the companys values and make the store a great environment. The only thing con to the job is the very busy rush hours.
good,"Best place I have ever worked. Starbucks takes care of their e,ploys, and there are plenty of oppurtunities to move up within the company. You learn a lot and are really able to connect with the customers there."
good,A typical day at work consists of a team of about five partners on the floor working together to ensure that the day goes by smoothly. Everyone has to always be on the same page and that's something I enjoy. I've learned different effective ways to communicate due to the fact that I deal with multiple crowds of people.The hardest part of the job is the multitasking aspect. The most enjoyable part is being able to connect with every customer individually.
good,"Every day I would wak through those doors, with a smile on my face because I knew I had a team behind me. Starbucks was a family. WE would make drinks, connect with customers, and serve great customer service together, daily. I only left because of medical reasons. I would still be there today if I could. But the most important thing that I took away from working there is having a team to work with, that you can count on that helps and support you."
good,the nighttime shift workers should be payed more than the morning because of the extra things that need to get done (ie. deep cleaning). fun workplace. stressful most of the time. flexable hours
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work in the hospitality industry. It's a fun work environment to work in, and the clientele are generally friendly and easy to serve. There are good opportunities for advancement if you stay long enough, and the compensation package is great."
good,"A typical work day consisted of working hard, making sure the customers were well attended, and the work space was clean at all times. I learned to communicate better with others and work better with a great team. I enjoyed working at Starbucks with all the employers because everyone was friendly and understanding."
good,"From the second I stepped into the Starbucks for my interview, I knew I was going to love this job. The welcome from the staff was overwhelming. Many of the staff members wished me good luck, as I entered. The interview was very professional done, and the interviewer (my current manager) was very set in finding a perfect candidate for his post; and that he did! LOVE THIS JOB!"
good,Starbucks was a good place to work. All employees and customers were all friendly and great to be around. The atmosphere was very calm and relaxing and the job was very fun.
good,Enjoyed working for company.  being able to interact with people on a daily basis was enjoyable.  Being able to help staff grow in there careers was also enjoyable.
good,"I really like this location and everything about it. The coworkers are awesome and everybody is very respectful with each other, the hours are decent and so are the benefits. It has good traffic so you never feel bored and get good tips. Management needs slight work but nothing to frustrate an employee too much."
good,A fast paced job which can be difficult at times but you have a great team environment so everybody works together to gets things done. They offer full benefits to anyone averaging 20 hours/week which is amazing. They also have very flexible scheduling as well as management thats willing to work with you to help you keep a good work/life balance. Overall a great place to work.
good,I worked at starbucks for a short period of time but my experience was the best. A lot of the workers who work at starbucks are genuine. It is a lot of work knowing the ingredient to a lot of drinks but working here was a good opportunity to learn a lot of skills. I would highly recommend trying to get a job at starbucks for the experience and the benefits.
good,The company was a good company until the CEO started to make all stores a drive-thru. It definitely took away from the customer experience. The requested days off were very easy. They offer stock once you been employed for about 6 months.
good,"Fast paced. The store I worked at had a drive thru and was pretty consistent with business. management was okay, but I really enjoyed making different variations of drinks and getting to help customers create their own beverages to the liking."
good,"Compañerismo al 100% excelentes compañeros de trabajo, aunque a veces se manejaban ciertas preferencias"
good,starbucks your always going to be busy whether if its in the morning or mid or late night your always going to be busy doing something whether if its helping the front or in the back. its was a fun envirmonet working here because your so busy none stop time flys bye
good,"I enjoyed it a lot, it made me think all day. "
good,helped with keeping store clean and helped customers with orders.learned to be patient.management was a hit or miss not much culture.Loved interacting with customers
good,The store I worked at was amazing.  The company offers insurance even for part time partners. It can be a challenging job though. The environment does change often.
good,"Management was okay at first, after a few months I saw her true side. Most of the co-workers i loved working with, others were rude and lazy. Favorite part of the job was having fun while working. The hardest was holding my tongue on certain things. I was improving my customer services skill and learning how to make drinks."
good,I interact with people on a daily basis and handle the day to day operations. I lead our team to the highest standard of customer service and deliver a great product and customer experience.
good,"A typical day includes tending to customer requests and fulfilling them as they arise. This includes, cash handling, making beverages and preparing food as needed while maintaining cleanliness standards for regular inspection and customer satisfaction. Great opportunity for growth and development within Starbucks, however management could use more resources to utilize the full potential of their partners"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work while putting yourself through school. It is overall a fun environment. They offer many benefits such as scholarships, health insurance, 401K options, free beverages and food. It can be very hard to advance within Starbucks because they often hire from outside the company."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks in New York City will never be what you think it will be. There will always be something to hear, see, talk about, talk too the list is end list. That what makes me get up early hours and stay late nights at a place like this, because I can find myself talking to someone I never would of thought of having a chance of talking too. It's not your typical job and never will be."
good,"The job experience is great and the coffee knowledge is amazing. The management team is great and very flexible with my schedule, as a mother that is very important to me."
good,its cool and fun they a ittle strike about the rules. need to pay more though. the break are cool though they make your time go by fast...they always got some type of event going on for the hollidays and stuff
good,"Working at Starbucks is fun, busy, and you get free coffee. I live working at Starbucks, but I am definitely ready for something much more challenging."
good,"Starbucks became family to me, coworkers and management was always there for you. Job was a little stressful with high volume of customers. Also, had days when customers were rude. But, overall Starbucks takes care of their employees, part time benefits and yearly stock earnings."
good,I loved working for Starbucks. It's an amazing company with great benefits. Your coworkers start to feel like family and some customers can be really great. Others not so much. The only reason I left is due to some poor management that recently came.
good,"This place has great energy and is an amazing environment to work in! You learn how to be an efficient team player as a barista at Starbucks, They treat their employees with a lot of respect."
good,"Good place, great benefits, works with your schedule. They make eveyone feel welcome, good work environment. They do need to raise they're pay for baristas. We put up with so much stuff for $9."
good,"I loved working there, the company offers a lot of great benefits. They vibes were great and met really great people. Great job for college students."
good,"Working for a corporate store is much better than it is working for a licensed store. Licensed stores work just as hard with greater volume than some corporate locations without the great benefits. No matter what store you work for the days are pretty much the same. They consist of rushes for breakfast, rush hour, lunch, after school, and after dinner. You're constantly on your feet but it can be very rewarding."
good,I am extremely fortunate to gotten fours great years of memories with Starbucks. As well an opportunity to fine tune my skills in a very fast paced work environment.
good,"The job overall was a nice environment to work in, the employees friendly and the management translucent. The speed in which you have to work as an employee there is very fast paced. There is no room to lazy people in this environment, they do expect you to work your hardest as it should be. Overall I loved working there and is a great option for anyone young and looking for a starter job."
good,"I had an amazing 8 months at Starbucks, learned so much I would definitely say Starbucks has the best job culture out there, and the amazing Customer Service training they put all their employees through is super enriching and other companies should take note. And the ones who go through that training are lucky because in the long run you'll be grateful for it. You may ask then why I decided to leave Starbucks after only 8 months? The pay. It was just too little, at the 7.25 per hr. minimum wage I just couldn't live. Plus to top that, they were reducing our hours. I was getting close to 12 hours a week when other people were busting their butts off with 35+ hours. (I should say I had full availability) I guess this just comes down to the manager you're stuck with. But what I'm trying to say is that as much as Starbucks wants to create a fancier concept of themselves, truth is they are a fastfood chain, where employees will be expected to do many hard tasks while getting paid a misery. Nonetheless the culture is just so amazing that you will enjoy your day at work and you will almost forget about how little your getting paid."
good,"I'm proud to be a part of this team. The work is exhausting, but as far as the food service industry goes, Starbucks is a good place to work."
good,"While working at Starbucks, I had the pleasure of being managed by 2 bosses and 2 different locations, both diligent and sympathetic. Learning to make drinks and interact with customers became second nature, and I enjoyed working. This however, was only the case for my first location; after transferring, my new co-workers were reluctant to help me further my growth, at which point I knew my time was coming to an end."
good,I enjoy working for Starbucks because it is a very giving company. They always want the customer to be put first even if what they are demanding seems unreasonable. I also like that its generally a fast paced work environment. The store I work at is also very local based and I love that I know the majority of the customers and their orders and they know me
good,"Definitely takes a physical toll on you."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for in that it provides many benefits that other food and beverage companies do not. They provide bean stock, the cup fund, health insurance, dental insurance, and vision insurance. Every employee also gets one mark-out per week."
good,"Starbucks provides great benefits and does a good job creating a warm welcoming environment for all partners. While at times it can be a stressful job, it is extremely fun and rewarding."
good,"Overall Starbucks is a great company to work for! The benefits are awesome: tuition reimbursement, emergency fund assistance, great healthcare and automatic 3% raise every six months! My only complaint is the fact that managers are viewed as saints essentially. Complaints from multiple employees about a manager are discarded. Managers stick together and turn the work place into managers vs baristas. Not a healthy environment."
good,I worked there for 5 years at 2 separate licensed stores. It's a fun place to work. The training is a piece of cake. You do not get the awesome benefits that a corporate store gets though.
good,"Where can I begin, I've been with Starbucks 3.5years now and It truly is an incredible company to work for. You can be as flexible as you want or need with your schedule and your manager will still accommodate your needs and wishes. There is a lot to love here, free drinks on every break and a 30-40% discount on any item as well, not to mention weekly mark outs of coffee, teas etc. "
good,"It can be stressful, but is always fun. I work well under the pressure at Starbucks. Its a fast pace environment and that is what I look forward to, the fast pace can also be an issue when things start to get overlooked. There are always advancement opportunities at Starbucks and it is nice to have that option."
good,Help customers and aiding co-workers with their tasks while also preforming many cleaning tasks. Everyone tries to be as helpful as possible if you have something you're struggling with usually.
good,"A typical day of work would include, being the barista, cashier, cleaning tasks, customer support, handling food and giving excellent customer service. Starbucks is a great place to work and is a very good company to work for."
good,This job helped provide for my family and fostered close friendships that lasted for years. Advancement is always an option if you so chose and most managers are supportive. Only cons are the shortness of staff for the amount of business.
good,Worked in close proximity to subordinate baristas as well as reporting directly to the general manager. Hardest part of this job is managing customer influx during peak hours.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work if you like having fun and enjoy what you do. Partners that work there are absolutely fantastic and it is always a good time going to work. We have a great boss who understands our needs and takes our feelings and lives into consideration. The most enjoyable part of working for Starbucks is that we get to make people smile, even if it's just a cup of coffee."
good,I currently work for Starbucks at Kroger on Stroop rd. I really enjoy my customers. I know their drink when they walk in and they love that! I love seeing them everyday and making them happy.
good,"My co-workers were great, they made coming to work enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up when we got really busy especially if we were short staffed. I learned that you just have to keep your cool, not every customer is going to be your favorite and that is just something you will have to learn. My manager was awesome, she worked with everyone as best she could to accommodate everyone's needs."
good,Simply a great place to work!  Amazing culture and everyone seems to genuinely enjoy what they do.  Great sense of camraderie.
good,"O, how fun it is! Being the first means of contact to a lot of customers is a lot of responsibility, but a pleasure knowing that you can be the start of a great day for customers. The co-workers are great people. Everyone holds the upmost respect for each other. Which makes working for Starbucks a great place. The values this company holds is awesome. I will tell anyone who is looking to be employed by this company, hands up! Great opportunity."
good,"I thank Starbucks for truly teaching me how to multi-task and of course, all the free coffee! They definitely cultured my palate with all of the many tastings! I had so much fun every day, very lively environment."
good,"The mornings are always the best times. Not a lot of people come in and you start the morning by setting up the pastry, organizing the food in the fridge, cleaning a little, brewing coffee, setting up signs, etc. It's very slow in the mornings and our customers are usually students from the nearby colleges. It is great to see them so concentrated on their work. I love making their mornings by just saying a ""Good morning, how was your day?"". Connecting with our customers is part of our job and is the reason why I love Starbucks. But then comes the mid day and the store tends to get a little crazy with customers and you start losing focus on them; instead you start focusing on wanting to get their drinks ready and done so the customers can head out to work or school. You start forgetting to connect and everything becomes a rush to just wanting to get one task done to start the next. It really benefits those who can multitask but my mind cannot process situations so fast; I love taking my time and just being able to create a nice relaxing environment for the customers as well as for myself and you can't really do that on a fast working environment. But overall, they are very organized people and the job is very professional so I do enjoy my time here."
good,"Learning from my managers and regional management at the company was amazing! The co-workers were put together to work as a family. If you worked hard, your manager appreciated the effort. It was great having 2 companies under HMS because it extended the family. The work culture is outstanding. Everyone wanted to excel, and help out the customer as best they can."
good,"Working at Starbucks really helped me to open my eyes to the world and see other people as paying customers. It helped me understand the business and why things are done the way they are. Hours are flexible and the company is understanding to full time students. However, you're not paid that much and you have a lot to do; constantly and non stop moving. Worked there two years and it got a bit too comfortable after a year and half or so. Every six months you get a review and if you do well, you get a couple of cents raise; not worth it though."
good,"- fast paced job where the staff is really close!"
good,"The people you meet everyday are great and working here as proved to be the best job i ever had. of course theres always little things such as some of the complaints a guest might make over little things, but the coworkers and management makes it a joy to come to work everyday."
good,"A typical day at work is how you make it. Positive attitude and mindset sets tone for Baristas and customers. The relationship with both baristas and customers have continued to grow since the moment I walked in. It feels good speaking with customers on first name basis as if part of family (in a sense they are part of Starbucks family). From regulars to stars, you never know who you'll meet. Had the pleasure on serving Boston's own, David Ortiz from the Red Sox. Missed our on Tom Brady though. Management here is great. Great communication from other shifts makes managing here really comfortable. Team work from co-workers is outstanding. With everyone on the same page makes our job a lot easier. Hardest part of job would be short staffing and unpredictable rushes throughout some days. Not frequent but still somewhat manageable. With that being said. I love that when there are times that you or another partner (employee) are unable to make it to work, you can call other stores in your district to see if anyone is available to come work your shift. Most enjoyable  part of job is the relationship i develop with customers and coworkers. I love to laugh and make others do so too. Makes working here worthwhile."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks includes preparing complex beverages for many types of customers, taking orders, working well with a team and being able to maintain a professional demeanor during every level of stress and through every sort of volume of customer."
good,"Starbucks is so diverse and I enjoy that fact "
good,"I had a great exsperiance working at Starbucks. The entire team was energetic, kept on their toes, and very nice. I learned alot about customer relationship, that its important to have that."
good,"This job was a love hate relationship, i loved the people i worked with because we always had a great time together. We would laugh while we did the dishes and cleaned and made the best of any situation. The hardest part of the job was not getting frustrated when customers got an attitude with you but it made it all worth it when you could laugh with your coworkers about it later."
good,"There was everything is perfect i have learned a lott, starbucks help me to gain my coffee knowledge also my professional skills."
good,"Working at Starbucks was great. I loved being able to talk and joke around with customers as well as my coworkers. I learned how to make excellent coffee and how to work efficiently yet have fun with a diverse group. The management there was not the best, but it was good overall. I truly enjoyed working with the coworkers that I had, it was a very fun time working with them which made us very productive collectively. The hardest part about the job was having an inconsistent schedule but the most enjoyable part was working with my coworkers and that environment."
good,"show up, put on your apron, clock in, wash hands, assign a front till, follow given instructions/ assist customers/ craft beverages."
good,"Uma otima empresa, em todos os sentidos. Deveria ser um exemplo para todas as outras."
good,The workplace environment at Starbucks is incredible. Our partners are always willing to help customers with whatever question or request they may have. There may be moments of frustration but we are ready to try and remedy any situation to the best of our ability. We aim to keep customers happy first and foremost and that is truly exhibited at Starbucks.
good,"As a contractor I came into a project that was totally different than anything I've done before and so I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of job function and a daily job.  "
good,"This job has been a very welcoming place where I have met some of my best friends. The environment is very fast paced some times and you do have to be on your toes, however the most dominant aspect of this job (and the one I enjoy the most) is the relational experience and getting to enjoy coming into work every day."
good,"They gave me the opportunity to grow not only as an employee but also as a person, i would recommend this job for anyone. It has really prided itself for the way it treats its partners and for good reason, you will feel truly appreciated working there."
good,A fun place to work. The co-workers could make or break the location you're at. Kind of tough when low on staff while running in store and drive through.
good,"I liked my job when I worked for Starbucks. I had nice coworkers that would help me and I would help them. But after awhile we figured out a way to vibe with each other and work as a real team. I enjoyed my experience working at Starbucks, I would do it again."
good,"Working for Starbucks is quite the experience. You start the day and end the day with the same customers who need their coffee fix. The coworkers make it fun and the different cultures you come across make it even more fulfilling. At times it gets a bit hectic but being able to maintain your cool is essential and not difficult when you are surrounded by a great team. Learning to how assess situations accordingly and apply positivity in all I do, has got to be one of the best lessons from working here."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of making drinks, taking orders at the tills or drive through. Cleaning the cafe and ensuring that there were always clean tables for customers to sit on. During the day people would have many tasks such as filling up the ice, cleaning the coffee machine, sweeping and mopping the floors, cleaning the toilets, etc. "
good,At Starbucks we work very hard to achieve our time goals when preparing drinks.  We maintain a clean store environment and a positive experience.
good,Lo que mas me gusto es el ambiente laboral que crea dentro de cada tienda.
good,"I love working for the Starbucks franchise. Would prefer not to work for one in a Vons, but other then that Starbucks is a great company to work for. Love knowing that everyday i can make someone happy and deliver the best cup of coffee."
good,"The company is very involved with its employees, great benefits and very forward when the customers are concerned. Gives great opportunities for bettering oneself in and out of the job place."
good,"I had to leave due to several deaths in the family,but if I had not of moved I would still be there today. Both, my manager and the company were amazing to work for and I was allowed to be myself. I highly recommend working for this company."
good,"Days at Starbucks go by so fast! You learn to multitask whether you want to or not. You must do 3-4 things at once! Lots of learning from day 1. Management can be deceiving hence managers are young and well they play favoritism. Co-workers are amazing. Hardest part of the job is memorizing all the frappuccinos' recipies, deal with addicts to caffeine and well at my location we had lots of homeless people which I do not mind them but they do push our clients away. "
good,"1- Good company to work as its tata."
good,I go in and perform day to day requirements that fill the customers wants and needs. I want more and different to become better.
good,I love working at Sarbucks.  I am proud to work for a well known company with great benefits and ethics.  The people are friendly and the environment is welcoming.
good,At Starbucks it is always a busy day. I never find myself bored. We are always constantly doing something whether its cleaning or making drinks for our guests.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks as i gained immense knowledge into the coffee world and culture. It's a happy environment and a great place to work! Social interaction is part of the daily job and I love that part of it as i am a very outgoing and social person!
good,"Always walking into work with co-workers with smiles on there face and a great attitude, helping customers throughout the day and getting to know each and every one of them is priceless!"
good,"I love Starbucks and the environment it brings! I have great managers, great opportunities, not to mention killer employee benefits!"
good,"I learned much about customer value, satisfaction and relations. Respect and honor to management and co-workers and was responsible to work and multitask with high-efficiency in a fast-paced environment. Most enjoyable was the privilege to develop relationships with local and visiting customers. Also, expounding my knowledge of coffee and the artistry behind roasting."
good,"They have great incentives and overall, really want to please their customers. However, there can sometimes be unpleasant working environments. I do believe it is stress put on everyone to meet quotas."
good,"Making drinks for everyone can be fun, the job is entertaining and involves a person who is always on the move. It's a job that helps you balance life and work and has many benefits, along with this it gives you the skills to provide great customer service during stressing environments. Great company1"
good,"The work itself can seem like a lot to begin with but once you're acclimated and have formed good working relationships with your coworkers, the job will start to come more easily to you."
good,"A typical day at work is never predictable. I have learned how to manage time wisely, and how to coach partners in a way that doesn't seem offensive. My co-workers are very diverse, and most of them are going to school for different studies. The hardest part of the job, is  we have so many different tasks with different expectations for them all, and the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all different kinds of people as well as the tastings that are mandatory, it educates us on our products which helps us up sell our products and beverages."
good,"The typical day at Starbucks as a store manager was shaped by the expectations relayed to the store manager by the district manager, which in turn were determined by the key initiatives of the company on the one hand, and the flow of business on the other. For me, those factors resulted in working shifts from approximately 6:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Monday's were our administrative days. I was required to schedule and monitor labor, use our retail hourly hiring system to identify potential candidates to interview, hire, and train,  analyze P&L statements, as well as weekly tracking systems to identify strengths, and opportunities of the business, and to read, communicate, and delegate any key tasks relayed to the team from head office. On other days, the store manager acted as a shift supervisor. This involved general opening tasks, monitoring inventory as I placed the daily food and milk orders, deploying partners to key positions based on their individual strengths during peak hours, run breaks, and calculate, record, and deposit the till drops. Central to everyday was the needs of our customers. I led the floor by example by standing on the till, or expediting service to ensure that I was providing a smile, and doing everything I could to ensure that any customer that left our store left feeling that they had had a legendary experience."
good,"Los días en Starbucks fueron los más felices y de mayor aprendizaje que he tenido; mis compañeros la mayor parte del tiempo. de buen humos, era muy ameno y lindo, en verdad ese ""tercer espacio"" era para mi el primero; amé estar en esta empresa, era un verdadero orgullo decir: ""Soy barista, trabajo en Starbucks""."
good,"amazing people, teaches you how to multitask, cash handling and people skills."
good,Worked in retail management developing new and existing employees.  Store operations and monthly budgeting.
good,"Amazing place to work for, have great benefits and make sure there staff is well trained."
good,"era muy divertido interactuar con el cliente y aprender a descubrir sus gustos por el café; se aprendio la cultura de café, realizar catas, etc., la gerente era una persona muy preocupada por la imágen de la tienda y por la capacitación de su personal; los colegas eran muy divertidos y hacían el trabajo muy ameno; la parte complicada, eran los desvelos cuando cerraba tienda a las 2:00 am y tenía que regresar a abrir a las 6:00 am; lo que más me gusto, el ambiente de confianza y cordialidad que se genera con los colegas y con el cliente"
good,"My daily responsibilities as a barista is to always welcome our customers with a warmth and respectful manner, connecting and uplifting our customers its a part of my daily routine, during my tenure at Starbucks,  I've learn so many things in my working career experience, we do value each of our customers with a positive intent not to treat them as a transactions but to invite them to other return visit.My managers taught  and guide me to every steps of my journey at Starbucks they support my store projects, they do a quarterly performance update to checklist what are working well and what are those  opportunities that need to improve about my performance basis.with their approval they trust me to have my own decision making to deploy my co workers to their respective positions and sliding positions as well as to have there breaks.My co workers/partners is like a family to me i respect each and everyone i value our Starbucks culture i always maintain and enhance my self esteem, ask for help to my co workers as needed. we have one goal in every shift, our customers will enter to our store with a warmth welcome and leave with an lifting memorable experience, my passion is a never ending job.the hardest part of my job is to saw our customer to leave the store with unsatisfied experience. the most enjoyable part of my job is to inspire and nurture the human spirit to share our coffee expertise to our customers and to help our coffee farmers to improve their lives through the cup of coffee."
good,"High energy, high volume store. Co-workers and management worked together as a seamless team."
good,"Responsibilities"
good,"fast environment, you meet new people everyday and you learn how to drinks and connect with your guest."
good,"Great employees, understanding management. Not much availability for advancement past shift supervisor."
good,I enjoyed the culture of Starbucks. It was a relaxed environment even though the workpace was at times very quick. I enjoy the customers and learned quite a bit through them as well as through the company.
good,"Love that they are very involved with the community. Management started to decline towards the end of my employment. Good DMs were laid off and bad ones were kept, seemed weird. Loved the staff at my store and in my entire district! Great benefits for part time employees and worked around difficult schedules too."
good,"A typical day at work starts with me checking in with my team and doing a quick look through of whats needed on the floor - does coffee needed to be brewed, do drinks need help being made, what needs to be stocked, etc. I will then get assigned to my position and my responsibilities vary from there."
good,"I love working here because I love coffee, I've learned so much about it, I've learned how to work quickly and teamwork is very well exercised here."
good,"Make beverages, customer service, sales, clean, stock, and cashier. You learn customer service skills and how to handle a busy environment. Management is usually friendly and flexible. Co-workers are also friendly and helpful. Hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with the fast paced environment. Most enjoyable part is having a flexible schedule and working in a friendly environment."
good,Working at Starbucks is a fun experience because you're constantly coming in contact with great people from coworkers to patrons. It is my job to ensure that you have a great time every time you come in Starbucks and that can be very rewarding knowing that I helped to make someone else's day. There are definitely opportunities for self growth as well as career growth.
good,Working at Starbucks is like being able to work with your best friends all day and getting paid to socialize. The company is all about interaction with customers and creating a second home and the only way to achieve that is by talking and discussing with customers about their day and jobs and life and taking a moment to just slow down and relax. My particular location is very busy and fast paced so you have to work hard and do well under pressure which I am very good at.
good,"Each day usually starts out the same with preparation of coffee, teas, and food. What I have learned at Starbucks is customer service like no other. The company constantly keeps you on your toes and products are evolving around every corner. "
good,"I literally loved going to work. Drink coffee all day, interact with great customers and my fellow staff made the job enjoyable. "
good,"A typical day at work would be fun! Where the employees are welcoming, fun to be around but on task and stay focused! That is basically the environment all day every day when working with a variety of customers. I have learned to work quickly, and efficiently, to work smarter and not harder. The hardest part of the job is multi-tasking and doing your job while paying attention to the customer's every need. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling that satisfaction after making someone's day by making them their perfect cup of coffee or any drink at Starbucks, everyone loves their Starbucks!!"
good,I loved working at starbucks. It was fun place to work. I got to meet new people from around the world and the best part was putting a smile on their faces.
good,"Working at Starbucks made me a certified Barista, with a steady clientele and a  great team, working at Starbucks was the most stress free job I ever had. "
good,"Depending on the position you are placed, this position offers a fast-paced working environment that keeps you on your feet, learning daily, and offering opportunities to advance in your barista abilities and coffee knowledge."
good,"Amazing job, if you're looking for a job during school or for an entry level position. Difficult to move up, unless you're dedicated 100%."
good,Target/ Starbucks is a great place to work. Target developed me to be the leader that I am today.
good,"Great job environment, fast paced with a fun team of baristas to work with."
good,You learn a lot of different skills from this job. Everyday we plan our day accordingly. Selling coffee and working together as a team.
good,Great experience to all things HR and being able to help people.
good,I actually loved working at the safeway starbucks. The customers were almost always friendly. My co-workers were extremely friendly and supportive.
good,"-come to work and would meet new people everyday"
good,We all had an amazing time working for this company and when all was said and done we had high expectation for product quality store cleanliness and punctuality.
good,"I was hired as a barista where I was then shortly promoted to supervisor. My team"
good,"Me encanto la conexión que había entre nosotros, la confianza y la responsabilidad que presentábamos cada uno de los baristas y gerenciales en general."
good,"This is one of the best companies to work for! A typical day involves customer service, barista work on our beverage bar, and learning new and useful ways to do our job efficiently! We also strive to make an impression on our customers, and start their days off with a great cup of coffee!"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to interact with people, customers value you more than in most service oriented industries. I got to know most of my customers by name and could make their drink before they even ordered. It is more than just coffee; it is a place for people to escape their day for a moment and enjoy not just a beverage but an experience."
good,"Just a fun place to work. Loved my boss, the girls I worked with and almost all the customers. We were treated well and very fair, good support system."
good,I loved seeing regulars come in a couple times of day to get coffee and being able to surprise them after a couple of times by knowing and having their drink ready for them. I loved my coworkers.
good,"It was a great place to work , made great friends, had a lot of fun."
good,"I was usually put into opening shift, which meant waking up at 4 in the morning to get ready to go to work by 5.  That was the only bad part about the job in addition to the occasional cranky, unfriendly customer.  Working at Starbucks really was a pleasant experience, and they offered wonderful benefits and discounts even though many of us only worked part time.  I really enjoyed my time there, and only left because I was offered a job that paid a lot more that was related to my major.  "
good,"I'm a coffe lover and Starbucks showed me how to serve the perfect cup of coffee, even for the most demanding customer."
good,"I worked as a barista from the end of summer in 2011 to end of January in 2012. I enjoyed working at Starbucks however I had to quit because they required me to work for at least 20 hours a week and at that point I was still in highschool and found it to be too much work. I just finished my first year at the University of Toronto and I'm much more flexible with hours and I'm currently able to work full time or part time."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of cleaning the store throughout the day, being on register, and also preparing drinks,coffee, pastries and food for the customers. I have learned how to make all the Starbucks drinks. I have also learned how to work under pressure when the store is going through a rush. The hardest part of the job was being able to just ignore the few rude customers that come in Starbucks like you have something to owe them. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy and growing accustomed to the ones that come on a daily basis."
good,"I start my day at 5 am, getting ready to open the store for customers. I set up the pastry case while a second person brews the coffee and prepares for the first customers of the morning. I then accept the delivery manifest and check inventory in order to correctly place a store order. Once that is done it is around 7 am, which is when I start giving out the first breaks of the day. We brace ourselves for the morning rush, cheerfully greeting customers and delivering quality customer service so they leave happy. Throughout the rest of the day we clean and make sure all of our assigned tasks for the day are done before we leave."
good,"Es una empresa juvenil, con unos valores de cercanía y acercamiento con las personas. El ambiente de trabajo es genial. Lo mejor es el café, el equipo y la confianza."
good,A typical day is pretty fast paced as we are the busiest store in our district. I am a closer so I work many nights. I am detail oriented.
good,Es un trabajo tranquilo donde puedes encontrar buenas amistades dentro y fuera del equipo de trabajo y aprendes de la cultura del cafe
good,Happy with job. good management but salary wasn't that great.
good,No day was the same as the day before.
good,"But just wish it paid better. Very on your feet active job. Its not all about making coffee, more like being a janitor. We do more cleaning then making coffee. Co-workers are awesome! Meet the greatest friends there and meets tons of out of state people."
good,"A typical day consisted of meeting and greeting our customers with smiles while making quality beverages. I learned how to be a much better team oriented player, and developed great leadership skills. My store manager and co-workers were all a joy to work with and learn from! the hardest part of the job was learning all of my tasks and responsibility at first but i caught on fairly quickly. the most enjoyable part of the job were the new relationships that i had developed with my co-workers and with many of the patrons who visited the store."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. They offer flexible hours for part-time employees. You work in a pleasant, fast-past environment. The quality of life working there cannot be matched. The most enjoyable part of working there is the relationships you are able to build with your customers on a daily basis."
good,"Loved it for two years, and then we changed management. Work just wasn't the same anymore. I loved the benefits, the people, the diversity and the flexibility starbucks offered. The pay just wasn't for me however. Great company"
good,"Store Managers are under paid in salary, measured with other companies! You are allowed to run your business as if its your own."
good,"Always busy day by day. If the volume of the customers were low, then there was always deep cleaning. I learned that I can be a leader and multitask more than I expected."
good,"It is fun and creative environment. Company gives you a lot of opportunities to grow, to expand your knowledge. If you have the right co-workers it can be a lot of fun. You have to love coffee to enjoy it."
good,Experienced developer and leader of multiple store partners.
good,Great place for short to mid-term employment. Fun environment with team-oriented mindset.
good,"A typical opening day would include setting up a pastry case, prepping ground coffee, and making fresh batches of cold tea and brewed coffees. I have continued to learn about people each and everyday. The training for the Starbucks corporation gave great insight to the different types of coffees and tasting definitions. The management was lacking, due to the fact the store I am at lost a manager and the area director was never seen. The people Starbucks hires are some of the best to work with. The hardest part of the job was the early hours with the most enjoyable being the contact with customers, fellow partners, and the company itself."
good,"I opened every morning at 4:00 am. I opened the store and helped customers, mainly working the drive thru. I learned many things about coffee and pastries and customer service. My co workers were amazing. My manager was also amazing, but occasionally didn't understand how to handle her stress. The job was sometimes stressful but it was easy for me to handle it."
good,fun organized diverse environment. team players. free coffe who can beat that. absolutely love working with this company at current level
good,Flexible work schedule
good,"I learned a lot about the culture of coffee and legendary customer service. If you get involved with the job, there is a lot to be learned. Serving regulars is also a very fun part of the job, especially when they only want YOU making their drink. Very flexible schedule and great benefits right out the gate."
good,"making drink to customers as the like and making there day betters, and helping them in a kindly friendly way.."
good,Very engaging and challenging. A great place to work because it is such a hands on work place with a wide range of clientele
good,The Starbucks location had a very big lobby for customers and it was fun engaging with everyone since it was near a hospital district we saw a lot of people.
good,"Working at Starbucks is tough, but rewarding. It requires constant vigilance and team work to make sure all orders are delivered accurately and that customers enjoy their time either in the store or at least in their interactions with the baristas. "
good,"Always learning new things "
good,"Starbucks is a fast-paced environment and utilizing each partner is crucial. In turn, I was able to develop my motor and critical reasoning skills to best make the moment right for our customers and partners. My team and manager supported me well and I was able to set goals and actively work towards them."
good,"Partners get so many freebies, discounts, and benefits. There is a good focus on employee's satisfaction as much as there is focus on customer's satisfaction."
good,"Although stressful at times this job is a welcomed challenge. You are always held accountable to better yourself to help the customers around you. One of the best parts, besides making drinks, is being able to connect and create relationships with your regular customers."
good,I enjoyed the merchandising for Acosta Starbucks. I left because I needed more hours and higher pay.  Training is short but thorough. Is a nice place.
good,"Great energy and environment. Loved every moment working there, but also very challenging. Great benefits, but the rate does top out a little low. If I had other income I would stay there forever."
good,Working at Starbucks is great. if you need more hours you can work at any other Starbucks. The downside is your feet get exhausted after working an 8 hour shift. Benefits are great! I had a blast working here the only thing I didn't like is that I felt we were short staff at our location this does not hold true at other Starbucks I have worked at. I've worked at Starbucks where I felt overworked and I worked at Starbucks where my labor felt light and enjoyable. I would recommend this job over any fast food place. there's great experience other jobs love Starbucks and it looks good on your resume.
good,Typical days were very busy and stressful. Management was very professional and flexible with work schedules. Coworkers were all very friendly and created a welcoming environment.
good,"When I started at Starbucks, it was just a job. I was going back to school, and it was flexible hours, with solid pay and benefits. I didn't really fit in all that well with my coworkers at first. I was shy, anxious, and intimidated by the customers and the volume of business we'd get at times. To be fair, I was fairly shy overall. One of my favorite coworkers there, a shift supervisor when I was still a barista, made me come out of my shell, and once I did... everything changed. I changed. I'm so much more outgoing and conversational now. I got to know the customers and the employees better, and now it's hardly like work at all. It's honestly a blast. The staff has almost completely changed since I've been there, save 2 of my coworkers, but I have really enjoyed meeting and working with nearly all of those who've come and gone in my time there. The regulars are incredible, though. They're seriously the best part of the job. We have some truly great regulars and an amazing culture at our store. So many of my regulars are so helpful and generous. They really care and want to do what they can for many of us, and that makes me want to do the same for them. It makes this job so intrinsically rewarding that going in for a shift is something to look forward to most of the time. I've made real friends of some of of my regulars, outside of work. The company is fantastic, as well, offering extremely competitive pay and amazing benefits. They even have a team of advocates who are professionals in handling interactions with insurance companies and will go to bat for you if you have conflicts"
good,Worked with the company during college and they encouraged work/life balance. Managers were excellent at ensuring time off and working around my school schedule. Any job I have had following Starbucks has been less stressful due to the skills I acquired while working at the company (v thankful for this).
good,"I liked how early I could work, LOVED the free coffee, discount was nice, partners (coworkers) were awesome & I overall just enjoyed the job. Its not stressful, its actually really fun making drinks."
good,It’s a decent work place wish they paid more it’s really flexible with scheduling work partners are the best here. It can be demanding and its really fast paced
good,"Timed sessions to finish certain tasks and move onto next tasks, making the work flow more balanced and organized. "
good,"Aquí casi todo es excelente, si por lo menos pagaron un poco más estaría mucho mejor."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks it hard fast passed work but you are apart or a very supporting team and leadership at different levels . Your given every opportunity to advance within the store or your education outside the store.
good,"i had a great experience, It was really fun. Great time. Loved it. Would go back. People were great, management was great. fun great and good time at starbucks"
good,Starbucks was a great place to work. Great partners and people. Fast paced and a lot of work but always well rewarded by management and the company. Working at Starbucks was probably my favorite job so far
good,"Starbucks is a great company to be a part of. They care for their customers  and partners. Plus they have amazing benefits. My store was one of the busiest on Long Island. Mobile orders, food orders, cafe and drive thru orders all day everyday. My job was to keep a clean and safe environment for my employees and customers. To make every moment right. The best part of the job was the connection you made with people. Not just your fellow empolyees but the sustainers. Something so little as a cup of coffee can brighten a persons day. Which makes your day complete because that means you did your job. The hardest part, it’s a tight ship. You follow standards and keep everyone in check. Make sure that one angry customer walks out with a smile on their face while also keeping a smile. Other than that, without Starbucks I wouldn’t be who I am. They taught me so much about myself, made me grow as a person and as a partner."
good,Starbucks is a great company to meet and serve new people while learning a great trade as a Barista. Also it's a great environment that can make anyone's day better.
good,Good place to work in and really had the ability to work along with others and have good work relationships. Flexible hours and ability to take needed days off.
good,"Starbucks is a company that taught me how to properly run a small business location. I learned excellent customer service skills, as well as cleanliness, organization, setting and meeting goals, ordering product, minimizing waste, and setting displays in accordance to standards."
good,"working at Starbucks made me grow the fastest way, because you`re going to be working in a fast phase area. the most enjoyable  part is that you learn how to make different types of coffee/drinks"
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks would first be coming in prepared with my name tag and apron. Then asking where I would be working for the day, such as cashier or barista. Then from there asking if we are currently out of any supplies in order to inform our customers. I typically worked more as the cashier so I have a lot of customer service experience as well as helping unsatisfied customers."
good,It was a great experience but some stores aren’t as encouraging as others . Some days I was over worked and did the job of my co workers and never received any praise .
good,It’s not the easiest job to learn but worth learning. The cafe family makes those early morning shifts fun. You really get to know the regulars and the community.
good,"I would always buy myself coffee before working here, then when I got hired it helped me save money. My coworkers were great. My manager was great, we all got along very well"
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great learning and growth opportunity- the company supports its employees to reach the level that they want to. From my experience, other staff at Starbucks are lovely and supportive of the team in general."
good,"I've always wanted to work for Starbucks. I loved the company and what it stands for. My first month I was ecstatic! There's a lot to learn within the first 4 days of training. It all comes with practice. I love our regulars. They come in almost everyday and get the same thing. Those are the customers that make it worth it. They are the ones who you can really create a connection with. The other customers are the ones who make things difficult. They can be extremely rude and super demanding. You may think, well how demanding can someone be over a latte? Answer is, extremely. Besides that, it's still an overall great company. The pay for a barista is a few dollars from minimum wage, but you get cash tips every Tuesday. Bonuses for referring people to work. You know your schedule two weeks in advance. Schedule stays pretty consistent, at least mine has. My coworkers are nothing but supportive and helpful. Partners receive recognition for their hard work. One food markout a working day as well 3 drinks and a pound of coffee a week. They offer to pay for school and help with insurance/401k even being a part time member. Who knew making coffees and teas could pay off?"
good,"Such an amazing place to work, you meet so many new people, you can build and create relationships with the regular costumers who come in everyday for their daily coffee. Working in a place where costumer service is their top priority has really taught me that a little can go a long way."
good,Starbucks was fantastic as far as working with scheduling needs and offering college courses to it's partners. The health benefits and pay are wonderful for the job required of you.
good,"Starbucks is a very confortable place to work if you show interest. In my own experience I can tell that I love the company's philosophy, so I've been always happy to work there. "
good,Very fast paced but an overall comfortable and welcoming environment for both employees as well as customers. You get to learn many new things not just about coffee but so much more.
good,Its a very fun place to work as long as you don't mind a challenge. Its a very stressful job sometimes and most if not everyday is quick paced. The employee benefits are really great but I personally don't think we get paid enough hourly.
good,"The hardest part of the job would be the morning and afternoon rushes. Great work environment! Customer interaction is what you make of it! Management at this specific location was not great, however, I've heard its changed since my time working there."
good,"In Starbucks I started to work first time when I came in UK. It's been a long time since I haven't been in Welcome break, the team is great, I had all the support from the Colleagues , I olso learned how to make wonderful coffee, the tastes of the coffee are lusch, all the possible tastes xx  All the people's been very friendly and nice xx My english was not so good but because I talk with coustumers I felt confident, happy and positive. I recommend it xx"
good,"this job teaches you more than you could imagine ever working at a coffee shop as Starbucks. I've not only gained the greatest work ethic, but I also gained terrific people skills; dealing with the awesome and the bad. The work can get frustrating at times, but what job doesn't. The benefits are great, especially if you'd like to get an online degree from ASU. As well as providing very cheap medical/dental/vision insurance. Overall, working here has been fun thus far and I'm grateful for having this experience to learn and grow."
good,"Starbucks really helped me get to where I am now. The benefits helped me get on my feet, the training helped relate to people, and the culture made me feel valuable."
good,"Trato amable, compañerismo, mucha cultura de cafe y te, capacitacion constante, buen equipo de rrhh"
good,"Es un excelente lugar para trabajar, aprendes muchas cuestiones administrativas, de liderazgo, entre otras muchas más ya que todo el tiempo tienen capacitaciones."
good,The workplace culture at Starbucks was very friendly and efficient.  Management was very good at communicating with the team and will work with our schedule.  The most enjoyable part of working at Starbucks was creating tasty coffee & tea to members of the community.
good,My experience with Starbucks was professional and welcoming. I thrived under the management that I was under. The job was light and fun. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
good,"It’s pertinent to be knowledgeable about the beverages and how they’re constructed. One of the biggest priorities will be to make customers feel they are in a third place. Do what you can to learn about and stay informative on the drinks, food, and products we sell."
good,"The day to day structure of Starbucks is faced paced with customer connections, cleanliness, and window times as priorities. The new dress codes allow for personal style and expression with relaxed guidelines. Personally would recommend finding a second job to supplement income since the majority of ""Partners"" are part time, averaging 20 hours per week. Although, after 90 days of employment you are eligible for benefits at a 20 hour work week average. I have always found working with the public an enjoyable experience through making personal connections through conversation with the hopes that I have influenced their day for the better."
good,"Everyone is very friendly and outgoing. I love the work environment, it always keeps you busy. They work great with scheduling around your availability."
good,"has a lot of benefits, great company to improve yourself as individual and great experience,  continously growing company, they have their own strategy to keep the great and unique customer service"
good,"I loved all my co workers but the new manager was truly terrible, bullied me and all the other workers, was fired from the store for her unprofessional actions."
good,Starbucks was all-together one of the nicest places I've worked. The management actually seem to care about the employees. The work can be hard and a lot of pressure but the teams are usually good about helping eachother as best as possible.
good,I love Starbucks company and is great with benefits and helping their employees. Overall would work here again but every Starbucks I have been at not just me but all employees are working 20-32 hours. Not enough to live off of if living on your own.
good,"Starbucks has a fun and light environment. Everyday is a little different depending on the position you are put on that day, and a lot of cleaning is involved."
good,"Even though Starbucks pay isn't the greatest you have to take in consideration of the their benefits. Health Care, 401K, tuition reimbursement, free/discounted coffee, financial aid if you're in a crisis, free stock. Amazing benefits for partners who only work part time."
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks was working at a fast passed environment . More importantly making sure every drink is make to the customers liking."
good,"La capacitación es muy constante , y hay muchas oportunidades de crecimiento."
good,"With the amount of Starbucks around, not every experience will be the same. The manager makes a difference. I had an awesome manager so it made the job more enjoyable."
good,"A typical work day, especially in the morning, is extremely busy/rushed. You must be able to work in a fast paced environment and have a strong sense of urgency. Management is different at every location, it really just depends on your team. The hardest part of my job is making sure everyone is on the same page. The most fun part of my job is making everyone;s individual beverage and getting to know my regulars."
good,"I think Starbucks is a fantastic place to work to develop your customer service skills. I personally think the pay should be higher, however, it can be a fun job and has nice perks."
good,Just make sure to go with a temp agency that will communicate with you when needed otherwise try your hardest to get all the information you can from Starbucks themselves.
good,"Starbucks is an extremely beneficial company to be a part of, providing benefits to part time workers as well as weekly tips and yearly raises. However, the actual job becomes monotonous and taxing quite quickly, leading to the conclusion that the pay may not be worth it. The teamwork and collaboration is phenomenal but not enough of a reason to stay there for long periods of time."
good,"Always busy and something to do"
good,"My star rating is based on my favorite manager in Overland Park, KS. She was WONDERFUL absolutely amazing!"
good,"Be ready to stay on top of things from dates to memorizing customer orders."
good,"A typical day at work could mean different things depending on what time of the day you worked. Every part of the day though  included two major things, cleaning and customer connection. We loved getting to know our customers as well as making sure the area we worked in was always in tip top shape. My favorite part about the job was getting to know the staff and our regulars. The hardest part would have to be peak, which is our busiest part of the day. Some may say peak was stressful but after working there for nearly three years I could run through it no problem. Starbucks was a great place to work and i'm thankful for my time there."
good,"Overall, I enjoy the job. I am here just until I find a full-time job, but I enjoy it. My mother, sister-in-law, and multiple friends have worked there previously. I would recommend strictly because of the environment and benefits."
good,I started here when I was 16 and it has done nothing but amazing things for me. I learned many workplace skills here with very flexible people that wanted to help me learn. They truly set me up for success.
good,"Have not worked there in years but it is very clean and well kpet together. There are tons of arrogant baristas who believe if you have worked there for any quantity of time less than them, then you are inferior."
good,"If you’re looking for a fun and productive work environment, this is the place for you. Expand your business and leadership skills here as well as challenging yourself to brainstorm new ways to make sales."
good,"Starbucks was a good way to start my career in the coffee industry. Now I want to futher it by re joining the company and bring to the table what ive picked up as a barista. Not only brining hospitality fron foward, giving latte art, presentation, and making sure the coffee served is of great quality."
good,Easy to move up if you want with great manager support. Positive and high energy environment. Lots of partner benefits provided by the company and flexible work schedule.
good,"Good management, easy to relocate, lots of structure. The best part of the job was the people I had he experience of working with. They were all so great. It wa n easy job to do well at."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making drinks, taking orders, taking turns cleaning either the dishes or customer restrooms. Honestly very fun and uplifting with the right coworkers and the benefits are definitely worth it."
good,"its the best coffee brand in the world."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work especially for students. They are very flexible with your hours. They have great benefits. I would recommed it for anybody who really wants to make a career out of it. It is easy to move up if you do things they way you should and show interest in moving up in the company.
good,I really enjoyed my co-workers and the work environment. I was really surprised at the benefits and how well the company treated even their part-time employees.
good,"Starbucks Is a great company to work for when first starting off looking for a job. It provides great benefits for their partners such as 401K, and stock options. Although has recently come under racial scrutiny, it still provides a homely atmosphere for partners and customers alike. overall a great company to work for. The hardest part of the job is the first few months of learning. Once you get a good grip on how to make drinks, the job is quite enjoyable. In a typical day, you will clean, make drinks, and take orders. There is no one role that a partner cannot do."
good,"Great management, great employees, full training, support, possibility to learn, develop, be promoted"
good,I worked here while finished college. The company helps college students. You feel supported not just be your store's team but by the company as a whole.
good,"Starbucks is a great place for someone who loves to be in customer service. For managers it is a great place to learn the operations of a business. A store manager is in charge of ensuring all partners deliver a legendary experience to customers and each other.  Management is fairly easy as Starbucks has standards and routines for partners that ensure all stores are representing the Starbucks Brand. Workplace culture is fun but at times very fast paced. The biggest challenge for a manager is partner retention. Most of the partners are in high school or college and often leave for when school begins. The most enjoyable part of being a store manager is being with the partners, coaching, training,  and watching partners grow."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. We did a good job of creating a team where customers wanted to come to our specific store and staff wanted to come to work , The culture at Starbucks relies wholly on the staff and management and if there is a good team, it is hard to find a better place to work,"
good,"Working as a Barista it was a high energy job. It was also quite a social job because of the customers as well as the team. When I first started working for the company it was difficult trying to juggle learning how to make the drinks, the fast paced environment, and maintaining the social standers. however as time went on all of these things became second nature and in the end it benefited me in many ways. the system is usually well planed out and everyone worked well as a team because of it. One thing I really loved about Starbucks is because it always seemed like a close knit community. What was most difficult to get used to on the job was the times when it got hectic really fast and always having to be prepared for it. Overall I enjoyed the job and learned many great skills from it."
good,"I enjoyed working here because of the ability to meet like-minded people and dose myself with bits of human interaction throughout the day. I am a ""people person"" so I enjoyed this aspect of it. The days were enjoyable and I caught up to the routine very quickly."
good,"working here is fun if you make friends with the employees and customers. hard work, but if you ave endurance and like talking to people it should be fun."
good,The job itself can be hard and stressful at times but what job isn't?  The benefits are amazing and they have tuition coverage for students.  My manager is great and works hard alongside us.  He also does a good job of working with our schedules.  The only downside is the beginning pay is kind of low and the hours can be hard to get at first.
good,only complaint i had was that the person i replaced didnt train me correctly because he was ready to move. So my training was incomplete. I Loved job.
good,"although i loved my coworkers and met amazing people along the way- the only thing i despised was working at 4am- i loved the quick pace, hard work, multi-tasking and love for the job. I did learn a lot of skills like: time management, mutli-tasking, controlling of anger impulses, etc."
good,"Very good benefits, three free drinks per shift, free food item per shift, weekly tips, laid back, great company values"
good,"Starbucks is a very driven in upholding its mission on customer service, and its well diversified company to work for. This company believes in its partners to grow with the company and gives bring out their leadership potiental."
good,"i truly enjoyed working there during my time as i had such awesome team, supportive and very professional. having to working in a stress free environment helped me mentally and financially"
good,"when it gets busy its stressful, theres always something to do. casual dress code and you dont have to wear hats. you get free drink/food. theres always something new added so thats always fun."
good,"Great company to work for. Great benefits. Each store varies! Learned a lot about customer service and about the background of the company as well as coffee techniques, etc. Fun!"
good,"I had a very good experience working for Starbucks. I loved my manager, who gave me opportunities to advance within the company, and to further my coffee knowledge. The hours are very flexible, therefore great if you are in school. When I came into work, it was like being surrounded by family."
good,a typical day at work is fast paced depending on your location. people. love their coffee so it gets busy but if you have a good team its mostly a good experience . theres also a atmosphere of calmness in this chain.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks. It is a family environment and I have met some life long friends through here. Management provided advancement opportunities if you showed interest. Great benefits - medical, dental, vision, 401k, Spotify, tuition reimbursement, stock options, etc. I would work there again. Downside - it is hard work!! The stores were understaffed often, so be prepared to work. Need higher pay, but the benefits make up for it."
good,"My typical day changed day to day depending what the shift supervisor that day needed. So I had different positions each time, and sometimes I didn't. "
good,I loved being able to work at Starbucks while raising 2 small kids. The manager was flexible with my schedule and did her best to work around my schedule. I also loved that I could open a store and be home to get my kids breakfast and spend the day with them.
good,"Starbucks is a very great place to work. The environment is very relaxed even when things get busy. It is also a very great place to network or build relationships. I worked 4am-2pm, it would often get very busy since it was the early morning. The most enjoyable part of this job is interacting with the customers and seeing regular customers faces light up when they see that you remember their entire order."
good,Great group of people to work with no matter the shift. Everyone got along. Management was always ready to help with scheduling needs for school and personal events.
good,"Fun place to work, great teamwork environment. Flexible hours, great benefits, very helpful managers and coworkers. Great customer service experience and a job that teaches you to multitask."
good,Starbucks is a fast paced environment. There is always room for growth in different aspects of your job. It is constantly changing in a positive way. They provide so much for their partners.
good,"It’s keeps you busy"
good,"I loved learning about where the coffee comes from, the different forms of drinking it, the science behind the coffee, the products that Starbuck sells, the Perks of working at Starbucks, the flexible work schedule, and usually the people you work with are pretty rad people. I really enjoy Starbucks!"
good,I was a shift supervisor so m job was to oversee the staff and delegate positions and tasks. I also had to manage all the money for that shift. The environment at Starbucks is amazing unless you are unlucky and have to work with the 5% of people who suck.
good,Depending on the day I would set up the pastry case or brew the coffee. We would have 30 minutes to 45 minutes in order to fulfill our duties that shift. Our manager would arrive and give us other duties to fulfill during her shift. The best part of the job would be the fast pace and the awesome customers we would receive
good,It's a fast pace environment but it is also pretty adaptable. Very fun and open coworkers.You have the opportunity to get close to everyone and also remain professional.
good,Starbucks was  amazing place to work at. I enjoyed working everyday and the people made it better everyday.  I would recommend starbuck to any young kid trying to make money.
good,Starbucks is very known for best benefits and perks. you have to enjoy fast paced and you learn a ton about customer service which will benefit you in the long run.
good,Starbucks is an amazing job. It's super flexible for students or people with other jobs. The customer interaction is life changing. The only down side is if you work at a busy location it's non stop go go go your whole shift.
good,"I enjoy faster paced environment, Starbucks did just that. Management for the most part is good, however it can be a bit inconsistent at other stores."
good,"I have loved working at Starbucks the work atmosphere is fun and quick paced great store culture! Hardest part of the job is working in reatil, the customers. Most wonderful part of the job is the culture of warmth Starbucks has brought in my life. My coworkers are some of my greatest friends."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks was very stressful and there was always a lot going on. But the people that I worked with made it worth it. I definitely recommend working here. "
good,"A typical day of work consisted of managing the store, keeping the team productive, and also accommodating the guests to the best ability possible. I enjoyed the personable, yet professional touch the industry of Starbucks had. Knowing the order, first name, and how old a guest's kids' are, brought that special touch to the business."
good,"i loved working there, it was a great first job, and I loved everyone I worked with. I am thankful for my experience there as it has taught me a lot about myself, and how to help others."
good,"Learned new skills like communication, customer service, and time management that will help me with my long term career goals.  Got amazing benefits only for working 20 hours, that isn't offered in many places.  My manager and coworkers are my second family."
good,"I really enjoyed my co-workers and a lot of our regular customers, and I loved the benefits. However, you get a lot of rude customers and sometimes the work load seems exhausting. I worked there for two years and I was grateful for the time there."
good,"I enjoy every day I had to work at Starbucks. I will say a big chunk of my positive experience at working for this company is because of how great the management was. My store manager genuinely cared about his staff and lead by example."

good,Starbucks is a great place to work! I enjoy making drinks and working in a nice environment. There is a nice balance of busy and relaxing workdays. The company provides outstanding benefits.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you are a student.  Flexible hours at many different times throughout the day.  Various benefits are offered, even for part time employees.  This was the perfect job for me when I was completing my college education.  There are many opportunities for job advancement if you show motivation and desire to move up in the company."
good,"Ya que estuve en un puesto donde tengo que controlar todos los aspectos de la tienda incluido a los empleados, aprendí mucho tanto como lo administrativo como en el área de RH y Elearning."
good,The people I worked with were fun and hard working. Making drinks was fun and teamwork is a must. I have no complaints for this job and there is always something to do if you look.
good,There's great things about starbucks but mainly for students or people who don't have many bills. Starbucks employees should get paid more. That's all
good,"Starbucks gives great benefits, environment, and morale. Depending you abilities in customer service and hard  work you should very much enjoy working at starbucks."
good,"I am usually scheduled at 2pm-1030pm. I usually start at the window taking  orders and connecting with customers. I also make beverages on bar through out each shift. There is routine cleaning through out the day. lastly closing procedures. For example stocking and more cleaning."
good,"I appreciate my time with this company, it gave me great knowledge of coffees and the process in which to roast and make it, as well as opening my eyes to new techniques in which to enjoy my favorite drink."
good,"serving customers with their coffee, cleaning and maintaining a clean store. not much opportunity to grow with in the store you're at. not enough hours to divide amongst employees"
good,"I was at Starbucks for a little over 2 years and was eventually promoted. A typical day is extremely busy, especially if working the morning shift, but it goes by quickly. It's a very diverse work place and if given the right crew, a lot of fun. Management at my store was great for the most part, but not all customers are great. There is also a lot of emphasis on how long transactions take in drive through, which really dampens the customer service for a lot of workers, so very important to know how to be efficient well also being extremely pleasant."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. The only reason I left was for a higher paying job. Great benefits and decent pay. Plenty of room for advancement.
good,Wonderful working experience. I learned valuable lessons in business and customer service and quality control. I worked with a team who brought world famous customer service and coffee beverages and pastry and warmed food to my community. The most challenging part of the job was the fast pace and stressful times in the early morning but thanks to those mornings I am now a much more efficient part of the team at Starbucks.
good,everyday work is the same but the experiences with the customers are different. I learned how to handle different types of people of different walks of life. Everyone is being valued regardless of your position.and the best part of my day is making someone else's day with my simple smile and warm greetings.
good,Everyone there I worked with always made me feel good and taught me important lessons that applied greatly to my life. They are like my second family.
good,"Awesome job but easy to get burned out. Love the room for advancement within the company. Awesome co-workers, face pace environment and regular customers. A lot to do, you'll never get bored."
good,"A typical day at Miromar is very upbeat and quick paced, you have to deal with customers every second and can rarely catch a break or time to breathe. Overall if you are the type of person who likes to stay busy, clean, be diligent and time effective this job is for you! For me it was perfect because I always had room to grow and something to be doing at all times!"
good,"Starbucks is amazing, from the coffee, to the setting the CEO set up. When working at starbucks you become a team and know each member very well. Coffee is amazing, you get a free drink per break. Pay is fair."
good,"I loved the pace of the job title, always doing something, never a dull moment, a learning opportunity around every corner. The most important thing I learned while working with this company is to not be afraid to be who I am, as well as developing meaningful relationships with everyone who came through our door, so many personalities to experience so if you are a people person this place is a wonderful place to spread your wings. I would have to say the toughest thing to get use to is the fluctuation in labor, labor is always trying to be saved so sometimes especially during rushes in the afternoon customer interaction was kept to a bare minimum."
good,great job to have very busy environment so I've learned to work faster hardest part is being on feet all day easy advancement if a student will work around schedule
good,Get chance to know what make people  love Starbucks coffee and what is the difference between other coffee brand.....get to K or how to do an art on top of coffer
good,This is an awesome company to work for. They have great benefits and really work with you on your schedule. If you're a student they have tuition reimbursement programs. The culture is phenomenal and management really shows with sales.
good,Great place to work. Culture is fantastic. There are lots of perks and benefits. Flexible hours. Decent pay. Lots of opportunities to advance.
good,"they have a lot of benefits, I only stayed here for 3mos, but I got a lot of advantages. this is my favorite coffee shop, they give employees 3 free beverage everyday. you can customize your own. and the compensation is good as well. unluckily I wasn't able to be absorbed as a regular employee because of some confidential reason. CLUE: co-worker issues"
good,"Starbucks was an awesome opportunity for me to advance myself. I started off as a barista, making minimum wage, but after two years I had advanced to a barista trainer, to a shift supervisor, and then almost achieving an assistant manager role. My typical shift as a supervisor was to ensure that our peak periods were executed efficiently by placing baristas where they needed to be, and positioning myself to help where needed. I was also responsible for running breaks, maintaining correct labour hours, ensuring our tills and safe had the correct amount of cash needed, and preparing and dropping of a deposit."
good,I had nothing but good times with this job and learned everything I could have ever desired about being a leader as well as an employee with this company.
good,"At Starbucks, the minute you got in the floor it was pretty much going at full throttle. yes there were down times but most of them were filled with cleaning or stocking for the next rush of business that would come through. It is a very team orientated Job, if you don't work as a team any shift will become frustrationg. Interacting with the regular customers was by far the best part of the day. Getting to know them and have them be a part of your local Starbucks family was really what made days good or bad in my opinion."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place to work.. A typical day at Starbucks begins with wonderful interactions with customers and coworkers. I look forward to greeting my customers, taking their orders,and hearing about their day. I enjoy warming and serving pastries to customers, as well as making their beverages. It is delightful to see their satisfaction after they receive their food/drink. The flow between management, and co-workers are very straight forward and healthy. Respect is kept as the key and everyone thrives together. The most difficult part of the job is functioning with little staff, although I always view a challenge as a good thing. It helps to keep me on my toes and challenges are refreshing in my opinion. The most enjoyable part of my job is making drinks. Above is my review on working at Starbucks."
good,There is never a dull work day when it comes to working at Starbucks! Managers and coworkers are always friendly and willing to make the work day fun and productive.
good,Empresa agradável com uma comunicação excelente com os funcionários.
good,Good company. Works with school schedules. Plenty of job growth. Great job to start with a fun company. Easy to move up. Management was great and easy to get along with
good,"My expirence with Starbucks in Spain was great. I started as a barista and in few months I became supervisor. That says a lot about the opportunity of devolopment. I create a nice team and a always had very nice reviews from partners, manager and costumers."
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great experience for any inexperienced young person looking for a job to work at while attending school."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for the company for quite a few years.  Half of the reason why I stayed so long was they were willing to work with my hours while I went to school along with the benefits and healthcare coverage I was able to receive.  The other half was the great group of people I got to work with that made our days when we were down or up.  They allow room for moving up in the company and are very dedicated to making sure that not only their customers are taken care of and very satisfied, but also their employees."
good,"I loved my job at Starbucks, but i wanted to further my abilities and grow professionally."
good,"This job was like a dream.  Great culture, really dedicated to workers and their families, great customer service skills and training; always leading with everyone's best skills forward balanced with needs and wants.  If I could go back again and do this job, I would."

good,"Working for Starbucks is a great first job. It is rewarding in every aspect you learn how to produce a product, customer service, and cleaning tasks."
good,"Starbucks is a great place. The environment is friendly and fast-paced, with great coworkers who want the best out of you, and care for you like an actual person. Good benefits, a lot of pluses, just really hard to get good scheduling. The best part was definitely learning how to work everything, whether it be the register or working bar, it's an amazing experience."
good,"Meet and greet customers accordingly, use product knowledge to sell food/beverages/merchandise. Sanitize all areas thoroughly, supervise over daily shift. Management is very organized and detailed, very culturally diverse and energetic. The hardest part of the job is the physical demands in the fast pace environment which can get strenuous. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and having enjoyable conversations."
good,"friendly work place"
good,Very demanding but rewarding job. Great benefits and pay but very demanding hours during holidays. Very strict and safe work environment.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my employment with Starbucks.  Their benefits allowed me to take care of myself.  Their management team was fantastic, from the District Manager, to the General Manager, everyone in management made my employment at Starbucks a life-changing, exciting experience."
good,Great place too work for coffee enthusiasts. Also have to be a great customer service representative and know how to multitask.
good,"Best job ever simply put. My fellow partners are some of the best people that I have ever had the pleasure of working with. My store manager Starbucks knowledge is absolutely amazing. Her coffee knowledge and leadership is inspirational. Best part of my job is my regulars, getting to know people over time and making their day just y making their drink perfectly."
good,era muy divertido trabajar ahí llegar ponerme el mandil y saludar amis compañeros que después se volvieron mi amigos estar ahí me hizo aprender muchas cosas sobre el café conocer mas  sobres los diferentes tipos de cafés los gerencia les tenían buena coordinacion al hacer sus cosas y an sabido mantener la tienda con altas ventas al igual que mis compañeros baristas  la parte mas dicil era la momento de abrir y cerrar  lo que mas me gusto fue que hice amigos      dentro de la misma empresa y a los clientes
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks. It's a very people person type of job, and I'm a people person. A typical day has its busy rushes and many customers who want specific orders, but I'm always working hard to help them. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers."
good,"open the store and make preparations for opening hour, run the floor, inspect food to assure they meet required regulations and standards"
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work. The management was incredible for the starting employees, up to the CEO. The company was focused mainly on the most superior customer service. The company was very liberal and helpful to all the employees. Great insurance packages for half-time to full-time employees, 401K matching, free stock, and weekly benefits of 1# of coffee beans, or a box of tea."
good,"Starbucks has a great atmosphere and culture, enjoy working with my co-workers. The benefits are fantastic, and available for everyone (part-time and full time employees)."
good,Starbucks is always busy but a great place to work at. Great management team and everyone got along well. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers. Most enjoyable part is the customer connections.
good,Starbucks is a fast paced place to work that is fantastic for students or people wanting a part time job. The pay is decent but the benefits really makes the place. Management can be all over the place I've had some wonderful managers but have also seen managers who never should have gotten the job. Over all its a customer service job so it has the pros and cons that come with that type of a job but over all the company seems to really care about its employees.
good,"Your co-workers are called ""partners"" for a reason. They are all genuinely nice people who help you when you need it. As a barista, you create a relationship with the people you serve. Even though you are serving the coffee, that isn't just a cup of coffee to them. It is your job to make sure that they start their day off on the right foot."
good,"Enjoy making someone happy and put smile on their face. Most of the time we move fast, so I learned to managed the time with fast moving. I am very happy with management and co-workers, we all understand our job duty, and that is what makes the job fun place to work. The hardest part of the job is to keep it clean, Syrups are everywhere. But the most enjoyable part of the job is making drinks."
good,If Starbucks would pay me more I would never look for another job.  A typical day is fast paced and consistent.  Management is easy to get along with.  Hardest part of the job is getting up at early hours.
good,In the morning it is a routine of keeping customers happy and interacting with every customers to make their experience at Starbucks feel unique and appreciated. Our mission and goal is to make every customer happy and fulfill their needs and wants with our knowledge in coffee and experience in the industry.
good,I believed that if you love Starbucks and you enjoy people you should give Starbucks a try!
good,"creates third place to customers by providing world class customer service through a cup of coffee."
good,"setting up for the morning rush, ""Aces in there Places"""
good,Great customer service is given and always recieved and to be a part of that is a awesome feeling!
good,"A typical day at work is really nothing different from any other day I go into work and assist the customers that are there at the moment. After clearing the customers out I then began to start prepping for my closing duties. I have learned that several customer service techniques and the many way to adjust to the customer's presence. My co-workers are great, they are all willing to help me as am I with them. The hardest part of the job is making sure the customers are satisfied with their drinks, making sure all the store jobs are done before we close. I enjoy my co-workers and severing customers to make their day great."
good,"amazing people and great place to work"
good,Starbucks is an excellent place to work.  They treat the employees well and there is always room to transfer.
good,The job is fast paced but is fun due to the work environment. Salary isn't the best but the benefits make up for the low salary. Job advancement is plentiful.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work and you get to meet great people. I have been working in corporate America for a year now and I now appreciate the starbucks world a lot more, the customer interaction and the craft of making a drink. Most importantly the Health care is might be the greatest aspect of working at starbucks"
good,"Starbucks is a great company to learn the basics of customer service. Manager's go out of their way to help you learn about company regulations and willingly help you move up in the company if that is your desire. I learned a lot about how to handle difficult situations and work in a fast-paced environment; multi-tasking between crafting beverages, stocking supplies, interacting with coworkers and pleasing customers where all part of the day to day routine."
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for. Having started out in fast food, I was shocked by how well the company took care of it's employees and how even if you are at the bottom of the totem pole, you STILL have a voice and those above you DO listen!"
good,"Enjoyed the cultured ways, they made sure to well educate me on the products that I worked with. I could speak with customers like I knew what I was talking about and enjoyed being helpful! The work environment there was fast pace and task oriented, which was great, but I found it difficult to complete my projects when having to relying on others. the best part of the job was that I had the opportunity to be personable and have regulars to keep up with."
good,If you got good memory skills and love people this job is for you. Depends on the store you go to but most starbucks have a good environment.
good,Starbucks is a very memorable and awesome place to work. It also looks great on a resume.
good,My most enjoyable part of working for Starbucks was the experience learning from such great managers and being able to pass that on to my employees. I was able to promote so many to management positions within the company. I have only to thank my mentors for helping me with that.
good,- Constant customer and partner interaction
good,I would get there 15 min. early so i can get a coffee before i start greed customers have coffee with some of them. When people come in i would try to see what kind of mood they're in so i can greed them probably. I learned to make different drinks.
good,A typical day at work there was relaxed and easy going. The people who came in were friendly and the employees were entertaining and friendly. All together a very nice working environment. I have nothing ill to say about Starbucks.
good,"Four years of my life well spent at this job; many coworkers and customers are now good friends of mine. Solid working crew and environment, could not have made with through college without this place."
good,"Making sure to enlighten customers and making connections with not just your partners (coworkers) but with anyone walking into the store. "
good,Very Good company to work with. Lot of talented professional.  Very good work life balance. Management have an urge to continue investing  partners growth.
good,"all coworkers while I worked at Starbucks were very kind and supporting, they would help you in any way they could and try to lighten the mood and help time pass quicker"
good,"I learned so many things while I was at Starbucks. there is a whole world of coffee that we are un aware of and if we just open our eyes we will see this . I also loved how it is very community oriented , what I mean by this is that you will remember  a face when you see them because in some kind of way or another it seems that you are somewhat apart of their life in a positive way."
good,"I’ve only been a partner 3 months but it’s literally a slice of heaven, from all the benefits even including mental health care, caring for our customers and partners making moments right and really connecting that builds a family, and free college. I’ve worked for at least 10 different companies and this is so far the best; if it’s not too early to say. However im proud to be able to own a green apron that makes a difference."
good,"Starbucks was an always very good to me, I worked there for almost 3 years, I had an odd manager that I didn't like, but the company overall was amazing, and the benefits were incredible."
good,"Greeted customers and explained the menu items. Determined their coffee preference and placed orders "
good,It was a fast-paced environment and really easy to pick up or switch shifts. It is always fun experimenting and learning new drinks and meeting new people and interacting with regulars.
good,Productive and challenging workplace where employees learn how to juggle multiple tasks at once as well as how to serve customers better. The work can get very challenging because Starbucks always has a high customer turnover but it does teach a lot about time management and prioritization
good,Great company to work for! I wouldn't work for starbucks for five years If I didn't enjoy it. Management is great and benefits as well! It has given me a lot of opportunities!
good,"It was a fun and great job especially meet new guests and getting to know them as regulars, and getting to try new beverages and coming up with my own custom drinks."
good,"Really enjoyed working here.  The most enjoyable part was the people - both customers and coworkers.  The only thing I would have liked more was to make specialized coffee drinks.  Usually during busy times, more experienced individuals would be given that position.  That was the best part of the job."
good,The hardest part of the job is getting through peak ! Maintaining patience and always insuring that the costumers leaves with the best quality service so that they continue to come back.
good,Very high paced and busy so you have to be alert at all times. Workplace was a very chill environment and very easy to deal with. Hardest part of the job was rush shifts when lots of people would come in at once
good,"It definitely depends on the store you’re in, some are really great and some have their struggles. I’ve been very lucky my two years with the company to be transferred between two states and two amazing stores, the benefits and the other partners make it worth it! If you work at a store with good tips, it makes hourly pay good"
good,"I'll totally recommend this job to anyone who is looking for their first job, this is a nice place to start. Of course is going to be a task to memorize the drink but it's actually fun making them"
good,I met great people at Starbucks and I learned valuable work as well as life experience. I was able to grow in my position at Starbucks from being a barista and leaving as a shift supervisor.
good,"Typical day starts at cash handling,making sure all coffee is ready for customers,ontop of taking care of breaks and restocking,and maintaining a clean and happy environment"
good,"Here is a great place to work very fast paced, you must make sure you have great customer service, and able to take a lot from customers and your partners, I am a supervisor which is a wonderful position to have. everyone from management to our partners barista's we all work hard to make everyone happy> i am considered the funny one, I love to make people laugh and have a great experience that they will remember ME."
good,I was greeted every morning with amazing co-workers and I enjoyed showing up to work everyday with no thought of dread. I specifically enjoyed the customers that would come in everyday. You remember tons of peoples orders when they come in regularly.
good,I enjoyed working here. It was fast paced but it was a good work environment. We would always get free drinks whenever we worked and it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere.
good,"Starbucks was a good part time job, but I am  looking for something that involves computers and an office environment. "
good,I usually worked the morning shifts once you came in you had to wash your hands and come right into the location you are placed. Everything is so fast pace there is no time to play.
good,"Starbucks is a great environment, I would definitely work there again. Starbucks has a very good diversity there and they are changing They are very flexible with schedules."
good,"It's typically very busy, I learn how to work fast and smart in a quick paced environment, and teaches you team work and how to be accommodating. The hardest part of the job is when something inconvenient during peak happens such as an espresso machine breaks down or your out of stock of a necessary item for the shift."
good,"i Started off doing store support, cleaning, washing dishes, keeping the store cleaned, stacked with napkins, straws, creamer, sugar, etc. Then I was trained to work the register. Eventually I started practicing to be a barista, I studied it, took the test, passed it and got certified as a barista."
good,"They are very flexible with your hours if you are going to school or have another job. Can be a very busy job depending on the location you work at and how busy they can be. You learn how to craft many drinks, multi task, have great customer connections, cash handling as you move up, manage baristas to their positions, lunching and breaks, inventory, ordering product, putting away shipment, and much more. This is a great place to start off with great benefits."
good,It was cool team members was great management was cool  fast pace environment comfortable the pay was good there were no contacting views coffee was great
good,"I've had an excellent 2 years with this company. They really care about their employees. While sometimes coworkers get annoyed by customers, I'm always proud to be on a team with them."
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work. I enjoyed talking with regular customers. The management is great and easy to come to with problems. There are lots of opportunities to advance in the company.
good,"Endless coffee"
good,It is a very well paid job to work at.you get to make an try new drinks out on guest. It is a very fast paced environment.  You also get benefits from it as well as tips an an a understanding boss
good,"Great pay and benefits, great flexibility of schedule. It really depends on who the store manager is. It gets tough in rushes sometimes but otherwise a great job."
good,"I am already working with Starbucks Coffee for 3 years and with a really good experience."
good,Starbucks is a excellent company to work for.  They go above and beyond for their employees to make sure they have everything that they need to fulfill their duties while on the clock.
good,"I enjoy working for this company, it has many benefits. Its such a fast-paced environment and cares a lot about teamwork. This job really teaches you to work with others."
good,honestly this is one those jobs you are always happy to go to every morning and the company is good to its employees and the experience is invaluable. hehe
good,Love this job. Great company to work for. Especially if you are a single parent or college student.  They are willing to work with your personal schedule
good,"I would restock, and mainly be stuck in the bar. I learned how to work very fast and efficient while keeping a cleaning due to the fact we would have long long lines. Management was great! she was very understanding and was amazing. Hardest part of the job would be the fact that we became short staffed. The co-workers were great! I really liked this job."
good,"A typical day at work is never the same as the day before, there is a lot of pressure on the employees to deliver their products fast, and efficiently. You never know how a customer is going to react so you have to have patients, and be able to deliver a smile and positive attitude no matter what happens."
good,"Happy time with partners. Great working environment. Nice salary. Locate in University library, not too much customer every day."
good,"This job requires its employees to be able to think on their feet and multitask. There is a huge amount of information to take in upon training, and it is more complicated than a typical customer service job."
good,"I was not particularly wowed by my workplace, but did enjoy being a part of a team and learning as much as possible. I also enjoyed the times and the fact that my schedule was met very efficiently."
good,I've been an employee of Starbucks for the last three years and have loved working of the company. I have gained so many skills during my time. The best part has definately been getting to make connections with new and regular customers.
good,"New urban coffee culture."
good,"I love to interact with my customers. My job title at Starbucks was a Barista.Baristas really are the face of Starbucks. They are an important part of our customers' day, and experts in handcrafting deliciously perfect beverages. Connecting and creating the moments that make a difference in each person's day. Shift Supervisors help direct work on the floor."
good,"A very welcoming job with a perfect cast of employees, rewarding work with advancement possibilities. Meeting people daily and creating great drinks along the way."
good,"Not only are the customers normally amazing, but the co-workers and managers always know how to have fun. Very relaxing atmosphere, and the company truly does take care of its employees."
good,Great place to work and taught me how to handle multiple tasks and how to directly deal with customers and their needs first hand. Great management and a very well structured environment to work in as well as having fun with fellow partners.
good,"Make drinks."
good,"Loved working for AFFES to take care of our active duty and retired military personal. "
good,"This was my first job. I loved everything about the company and still do. A typical day included showing up for work on time and opening the café. Making sure drip coffees were always at hand and brewed properly, and assisting customers while building rapport and remembering common faces and names. I was an opener and showed up for work at 4:30 a.m. daily."
good,"stock the food and salad trays, serve coffee, and conduct coffee tasting seminars"
good,这是我第一份兼职工作，选择这里一是因为我对咖啡的知识的喜爱与兴趣，二是因为星巴克这个公司的知名度与企业文化知识。每天的工作基本都是一样的开吧，制作咖啡，咖啡销售，清洁，整理货物。虽然每天8个小时的工作量比较大，但店里的伙伴人都很好，感觉就像一家人，大家在一起很开心，所以即使累也会互相鼓励与帮助。最开始我觉得最难的是大声叫欢迎光临，因为我慢热型的性格，后来我觉得最难得是收银，不过后来慢慢地也上道了，也主动和顾客推销店里的产品。工作中最有趣的事情就是顾客不多时，向顾客销售咖啡时，听顾客叙述自己一天的发生的事。在这里我学到了合作的重要性和与一些销售技巧，还有一些做人的道理。
good,"Starbucks was one of the best jobs I have had.  this job had many perks. Free coffee, 401k, health benefits, stock.  I definitely recommend this job to anyone."
good,"My typical day at work was always busy serving customers."
good,"This is a fabulous company to work for. I absolutely love the fast-pace environment and what I am trained to do: make drinks, clean, and most importantly, provide excellent customer service. I have learned how to manage my time very efficiently and productively to make sure everything gets done correctly and within a good acceptable time. The best co-wokers are the hardworking ones. It is very difficult to work with people who do not do their end of the work. I have made amazing friends working here and even quit my other job that paid much more to work more at Starbucks. At times it is stressful, but in the end, seeing the smile on the customer's face is all what matters."
good,Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. The culture is awesome. Everyone is there for coffee. What's better? I've had 5 great teams in 5 great stores and have be able to work my way up the ranks of management. If you can engage your customers and partners your experience at Starbucks will be World-Class.
good,Starbucks is one of the best companies I have worked for. There are only downfall to this company is the pay rate. The amount of work and dedication that the employees provide versus the hourly wage is not equal ( I believe) I think Starbucks employees are under paid and the corporate stores do not take into consideration of each stores function.
good,"The management at my local starbucks was absolutely horrible. There was talk of forcing people to quit there jobs so they didn’t have to go through the headache of firing. Nothing is excusable, my coworkers kitten died and they made her feel so guilty for calling in that she ended up working after having to bury her new kitten. Absolutely disorganized and I got zero training because managemnt was busy pinning employees against each other and starting unnecessary dram."
good,Fun an exciting job. Love to see people smile when you hand them their morning coffee. Or even after work coffee. Crazy how 2 cup can change someone's mood so quickly. You can either make or break someone's day with that cup you hand them so be sure you always put a lot of love into one cup !
good,"It was a really good job opportunity at the beginning, but then it started to get awkward as i felt that i wasn't able to bond and be a part of  a team."
good,It's been a fast but some what loving 3 years.  I feel as though the company shifts points of focus more to customers then employees servicing customers.
good,Hated the hours. Manager didn't help. Not enough guidance. Stepping stone to a better career. Don't use Starbucks now at all.
good,"I was always an opener, so I arrived at the store early. Then it was non stop until my lunch break. Then again non stop until I clocked out. They did not have a designated breast feeding/ pumping space, which meant I lost my supply for my daughter. The people that I worked with were amazing."
good,i hated it. the management was not great.  long hours the pay was not great. they did not follow starbucks standards. did whatever they wanted to do. g
good,"My store located in hoboken, NJ was horrible to work in. the customers were ok. but management was bad. roaches everywhere and mice. working there was stressful. they need a new ""playbook"" or give us more partners to work well."
good,Company amazing as far as community out reach - local management did not adhere to the
good,"Every day is about the same. which makes it easy. the associates you get will make or break the job, same with management."
good,working there was ok intel they didn't take into account that I was a college student who had to eat on campus and need time to do homework. they would give me more hours then I asked for during times that I have set up for me to eat or do my homework.
good,"customer relations were great"
good,It’s a great company but at times does require one to work multiple roles on a shift. Scheduling tends to have frequent “mistakes” but I’m sure that’s not every manager at every Starbucks.
good,They give you a lot of hours.The job is stressful and usually very busy. It is very demanding. The place i worked at management was not that great. Coworkers were nice.
good,"I would recommend this job to someone just starting out that does not have many financial obligations. I am sure much has changed since I worked there back in 2012, but when I worked there, it was not a set schedule, it did not pay very much, but I did love the actual job. I liked my co-workers, and I liked making drinks, and it did have many benefits like tuition reimbursement, but I did not use any of them since I was still in High School and lived at home. Overall, it was a great place to start my working career."
good,"The manager at the location I went to didn't even know how to work the regisyer or any of the codes need to ring the different beverages, she had a poor attitude and super favortism within her employees. Starbucks in general the company is amazing there multiple choices of different coffee and hot/cold beverages are out of this world. There drinks are so good. I'd tell any and EVERYONE to have a drink there and visit often."
good,"The culture is changing and not a lot of room for advancement. Not always a wonderful place to work, not always accepting to a work life balance. Hard to balance if you have a family."
good,I have been with the company for 8 years. its a great company but the job is a bit overwhelming for what they pay you. the coworkers are defiantly one of the reasons I stayed so long. they become your family.
good,"I worked at the second busiest store in the city, with lines out the door on a constant basis it hardly gave me time to breathe. With this came both pros and cons. I would say the most positive thing about being a barista at this particular location was the non stop interaction with people. A con of this position was that when I was hired the store was short staffed fifteen people, thus creating a very hectic atmosphere."
good,"It’s part time. I work 3 hours, twice a week. Management absolutely is terrible. Everyone always calls in. Employees come and go all the time. Just looking for something more stable.."
good,it was ok overall management showed favoritism often wanted to relocate immediately. Staff played alot they didn't give enough hours and people were never coming back from breaks on time. still one of my favorite places nonetheless
good,"Every time a new supervisor was hired, the other supervisors would try to pick on them. They were petty and wanted to play who's the better shift supervisor."
good,"After being a Starbucks partner for so long, I was expecting something similar (business model wise) but seems like the Reserve brand still has a lot of work to do as far as reviews, reviewing your management and excelling further within the company. HR is not as helpful as one would believe."
good,Workload is often very hectic. Staffing seems to be a constant issue. Some management members do not seem to care completely about their employees. Quick to terminate someone.
good,"Working at Starbucks is at most times very pleasant, but at times there are people who are hired who like to gossip, and not act professional and bring their personal issues to work, its most pleasant when we all work together as a team"
good,"My manager wasn’t motivating or the best mentor so my opinion is a bit bias. I feel that with better management, things definitely could’ve been better."
good,"Not all of starbucks is toxic, but a few select stores are. The workers rather gossip and cause drama than do their actual jobs and create common enemies with the manager, then hours get cut. i have definitely learned how to toughen up and have thicker skin while working here, but overall i would not suggest it"
good,"I was hired on with a positive team, and the manager that dreams were made of. Then a few months in she left on maternity and a new manager came in and made work unbearable. Anyone who worked there prior to the new manager wants to quit- if not already."
good,"Love meeting new customers, also love seeing my everyday regulars. Love finding about what people enjoy drinking when they come to Starbucks. I Love the Job."
good,"С приходом в Starbucks нового руководства,в компании пропала атмосфера,пропало желание превосходить ожидания,работа перестала быть в радость.Пропало вдохновение,в работниках подавили желание расти и продвигаться."
good,"ehhh didn't really like it and I just really wished I enjoyed my employees well it was mostly the management, they were very unprofessional. and I can't wait to work somewhere else"
good,"I mean , its oka. It's kind of like high school. you have to make sure you make the right friends to be able to move up. A typical day is that you have to do a lot of work for little pay. Sometimes mangers don't know how to mange. Hardest part of the job is that you have to make sure you don't get on anybody bad side. Fun part is the people you meet."
good,"Good Company to work for as a Job, not necessarily as a career. Lots of Benefits, definitely good compensation. Hours are good not great and pay leaves something to be desired. Overall good company to gain work experience and customer service."
good,"At Starbucks you are expected to work long hours, for little pay, often outside of the availability you've given. It's a very stressful job, very fast-paced, with little time for training or breaks."
good,Exelente empresa para laborar muchas prestaciones pero horarios muy complicados
good,High demand job. Hours are ridiculous as a supervisor. You have to commit yourself. There is little to no work-life balance. You need to be there early or late
good,Stressful to work in the early mornings. Customers are terrible and obnoxious. Time sensitive job. Was definitely not my cup of tea but I made it work in the time I worked there.
good,This company is great. Been there for a little over three years and I absolutely love it. the benefits are amazing. I love connecting with the customers.
good,I worked in many different store the company over all is amazing but depending on what store you are at you can run into difficult times. But I had a wonderful 8 years with them.
good,"Typical work I loved what I had a passion for, growth, culture, experience. I enjoyed meeting new people from different walks of life. I have excel all my challenges that came with my duties that I had to perform. I have learned a lot, and it has made me the employee who I am toady."
good,overall experience with this company was not good but made some okay money working for them at the time I will not return here at all. but it is where I met my wife.
good,Great customer Service skills and Verbal.. It Was fast paced high volumes You must try to connect with search and every customer That assures That they come Back
good,"Overall great place to work. Learning new things everyday. Hardest part of the job is learning all the different drinks, or how to make them on top of knowing the most popular drinks."
good,"1. A lot of consumer traffic."
good,"free coffee and snacks but can be stressful at time. you can never call out because they are always short staffed but its worth it for the pay and tips and the coworkers you get to hang out with,"
good,"Greet the manager"
good,A typical Day at Starbucks consists of a lot of good memory building good relationships with the customers . A very fast paced work enviorment where it is very easy to be nervous and make mistakes. I have learned that no matter what is going on in your work environment its best to keep calm and not stress because that causes your coworkers to feel that stress and that can go over into your customer service. Over the past 3 years of my working at Starbucks i have had both good and bad management i have seen 3 new managers during my time and it has gotten better . I Get along very well with both my management and coworkers people always come to me for help any knowledge on certain materials and new promotions .
good,Work was fun and customers were great. Management was highly judgmental and impatient
good,Kinda ok. Suuuuper stressful and difficult management to deal with. Coworkers were very judgemental & customers were horrible to deal with. I didn’t like this job.
good,Generally when you start off as a barista it is a fun filling job . Getting to know yourself while being around others gives you a sense of belonging . After that everything goes downhull
good,"I love the company. its a great place to work. "
good,"I spent almost a year working for a licence Starbucks. I didn't receive any of the benefits employees of corporate stores receive, and the store its self was poorly managed. The manager was very inflexible with working around employees class schedule as all employees were students of a local university. She often spoke to employees in a degrading tone, critique baristas performances behind there back. If she ever had to cut her 2 hour lunch break short to jump on the line, or help with a rush she would become aggressive, refusing to openly communicate with other employees on the line, even smashing into employees with the force of her entire body weight if she was upset with there performance. If it hadn't been for my amazing co-workers I wouldn't have lasted a month."
good,"I had an amazing time working for Starbucks when living in the Seattle area. The environment was fast paced requiring a team that works well together and communicates efficiently. The values and goals of Starbucks portraying the Customer Experience were nailed on every aspect working with my team in Seattle. After transferring to a slower store, with poor management in Spokane, I regretted moving here."
good,"Great company, benefits and perks. Horrible management (GM/SM/ASM).  They dont care about their employees, and very ""clique"" or high school like atmosphere.  You have rudest customers, who try for free stuff daily!!!!"
good,"Although the working environment was good, the problem was the lack of skills that the managers had to set the schedules, to organize the tasks for each employee."
good,"A licensed location has the name and ingredients of a full store, but not the same benefits. You are able to become a certified barista, or certified barista trainer, but there are no benefits, stocks, or 401k."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Starbucks! It was challenging at first but once I learned how to make the basic drinks it was a lot easier. It was always pretty busy and I learned to work under pressure.
good,"However, ive work for course of 5 years into this company. This is my lifestory. 5 years into the company, no one will tell you i didnt do things right, wherever they put me everything will done, from stocking the area, to labeling the are to cleaning the area to also helping others insuring their area. Never once called off, always on time, making a good fun working environment for my partners and guests. Always thinking ahead for before i leave my shift that the shift whos in charge will be okay until the following person shows up. Every time they ask me to stay late i do, but when i ask a favor when i need to go early i never get a favor in return all due because im not clowning around or being friend to my manager. Its a job that if you want to grow, make the manager laugh and have a good time youll grow in no time. But if you’re the person who loves the job and wants to work and go in there only for work... then you will be stuck there for the upcoming 5 years like me until you put a stop and find other opportunities  which im very happy for that my manager put that pressure on me to seek another job"
good,"This review is more of a reflection of Columbia Sussex, LLC not Starbucks. They expect too much with little to work with. Was not willing to work with my schedule. Position was not what I was promised"
good,"I technically worked for giant, since the starbucks was inside the market. with that said, the benefits were really bad. multiple coworkers were fired for just serving themselves a small coffee, when Starbucks franchises let their employees serve themselves at least one cup per day."
good,Starbucks is a rewarding job. There is plenty of customer interaction. Be ready to answer questions to the smallest of details. You have to be willing to show face to people on the daily. Very enjoyable work environment with good coworkers. Fast-paced.  I would say that no experience is needed. On the job training available. Average about three To six months to learn everything. It’s very fun after you get the hang of it.
good,"I was there before they updated the dress code. "
good,"Starbucks in general is a great place to work. Especially if you're looking for an out of high school, going into college job. Unfortunately, the second location I worked at was too cliquey. Too much like high school. The manager doesn't work with your hours of availability. Definitely chose favorites, too. If you weren't in, you didn't get your hours or barely the time of day. At any other location I worked at though, it was amazing. You are really made to feel apart of a team. Starbucks is big on referring employee's as ""partners."" In the second location I worked at, advancing was extremely difficult. I would not recommend working at the Eastgate/ Cincinnati, OH location. "
good,"they were very closed off and would not allow you to grow., they constantly found small issues to pick at you over when in reality you were simply more focused on customer experience"
good,"I would at the Starbucks on a university campus so our business would be in waves between classes.  They also did not accept tips for some reason I did not understand. The first day on the job the manager trapped my in an hr and a half story about herself, spilling tons of personal information I did not want to know.  They also threw out tons of pastries at the end of the day that hurt my sole.  If they would just provide a plastic example then they wouldn't have to waste all that food and the closing at the end of the day would be quicker.  Overall the environment is clean and friendly. They are a good company."
good,This is a fast paced demanding job with great benefits if you're working more than 20 hours a week. Free drinks while you work as well as one food item during your shift.
good,"I had a great working experience and relationship during my time at Starbucks. "
good,"Friendly customers, fast paced, short hours or 12 hour shifts, management was good for the most part, employees were amazing, good discounts and markouts at the end of the week."
good,"The most enjoyable part about my job was fulfilling our guests needs."
good,"Working at Starbucks was great, until they never opened opportunities for the people who were there longer. Rather they'd hire people on for the position instead of promoting. "
good,"always busy, but fun to work there. The people you work with are always nice and it is easy to make friends. The only downfall is that when hired you don't receive as much training as you need."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, but the pay isn’t great and they don’t offer advancements to the people who really deserve it. I love working for Starbucks, but the manager that I had wasn’t a very good one."
good,"A typical day at work would involve around serving our world class coffee and products to our valued customers.  I've grown and developed immensely within the company, personally and professionally.  Examples include time management, public speaking, and personal development and professional growth.  Workplace culture is created by making sure everyone matters and belongs, making the best moment in everyone's day.  I could not point out the hardest part of my job, however I can say that each day is presented with new challenges.  The most enjoyable part of my job is making people happy, both my employees and customers alike."
good,I would never leave that job. But the only problem was the manager leg time and the store was run by others which made it really disorganized. I loved working there until this happened
good,"Definitely need amazing customer service skills for this position. Fast paced job, you have to be on you're toes working here. It was always fun because making people's day with their coffee was the best part of the job ."
good,"In charge of full operation of the store. Make sure the daily order is put away.  Find out who si schedule to work. Begin to make coffee, teas and food products are available.  Do daily order. Depending on what day of the week you have to do the weekly order. Open the store attend to guest.  Peak time  take care the guest and clean up."
good,Good place to work and learn how it is to work in leading companies of the world.average salary.I gpt fired because i had an emergency in my family and took a leave. And was only given 7days leave which was not enough.
good,Amongst regulars you will be able to build unique relationships built around positivity as well as genuine interest. These are the best benefits at working at a place such as Starbucks.
good,"I learned how to multitask, deal with inpatient customers, control cashier while making a coffee was really easy for me to do."
good,"A typical day at work as a Barista would involve creating drinks, operating the register system, communicating verbally and non-verbally with both staff and customers, maintaining excellent customer service, use of cash register and register systems, use of drive-thru systems, preparing of coffee, maintaining cleanliness of the store, the promotion and sales of merchandise, and the training of employees to peak performance within a three or four day period."
good,Starbucks is very fast pace all day learning different types of coffee and drinks was hard but fun the people that I worked with was fun and energetic the hardest part of the job is remembering drink ingredients without the cheat sheet
good,"work was dreadful, management was terrible. The hardest part were angry customers. Some coworkers were fun and most enjoyable. learned to handle tough situation."
good,"Cash Management "
good,"Typical day at work- serving a customers, learned upselling."
good,"I like working there and the work is enjoyable. My only complaint is that I was hired as full time, but since working there I've yet to receive full time hours. This is frustrating because I don't hardly bring home any money. When I spoke with management about this, they didn't give me a 100% concrete answer."
good,"It’s great if you need flexibility, for school you definitely need a"
good,This job was very enjoyable when it came to the atmosphere and the pleasant and routine customers. however management and the operations of this job sucks. Learning new drinks and recipes was always fun. but opening and closing was horrid.
good,"Starbucks was great, I would watch out for a store that is understaffed if you consider applying. I would also recommend working at a corporate store rather than a licensed business with no benefits. It’s about your attitude and your work ethic along with your co workers that make the experience happen."
good,"Ambiente laboral agradable, buenos compañeros de trabajo. Solo falta que respeten los horarios de descansos"
good,"This is a great job to have while in college. Though, I would not recommend a career out of it due to the amount of work required and the amount of people who wont notice it."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work, but the upper management was very disengaged and let problems escalate.  The people that worked in the stores were all great people, but the upper levels were not great unfortunately and ruined the experience of working for such a great company."
good,"The Starbucks I was employed at was apart of the Carthage College campus, therefore we were not allowed the same benefits as a traditional Starbucks. The environment was very relaxed, sometimes to the point where the managers could disappear for hours without returning. The workplace culture was also relaxed, except during rushes, which were extremely difficult. Many times we ran out of supplies and our machines broke without hope for repair. Also, we were not allowed tips, which was understandable as we were on a college campus, and unlikely to get tips from the students anyway. However, despite the negative setbacks, I would not trade my coworkers nor my experience as a barista for anything in the world."
good,"I enjoyed working there, my co-workers were so fun to work with. The atmosphere was welcoming, and there are regulars you get to know. The summers are intense, especially with rude customers, the same thing happens around Christmas time, but at the beginning of the year, it's rather slow and quiet."
good,"It was very busy during the hours that I worked."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, I stayed busy and made pretty decent money. The work isn't very hard and you get the opportunity to meet all kinds of people from all over the world."
good,"Fast paced, intense environment. Always busy. If you’re drink isn’t right we remake it. Very physical job. Most baristas only get 4 hour shifts and most only get like 15 hours a week. Everyone hates it and complains about needing more hours."
good,Love this company I worked for it was a great for improving my socializing skills as well as strengthen my work ethic. The guest were amazing and always appreciated our efforts.
good,Love working for Starbucks. Manager could not fix the  schedule. Made my life with my kids harder. Loved the customer and the area I was in but that all.
good,management could be a lot better but overall it’s a great business offers a lot for there partners with  is pretty amazing many benefits working there and th best
good,I enjoyed this job.  It was a great learning experience.  I also learned so much working in customer service.  I learned that it is important to make the customer happy.
good,follow opening procedures. Attend to customers recommending different types of beverages. Maintaining work place environment in clean and orderly fashiom.
good,The company is an excelent company to work for. They provide amazing benefits and the work environment is great with the right people. Getting to know costumers is a great experience. My store needs a new manager but other than that it’s a great company
good,Overall the job is easy once you get the hang of it. It takes a little time to know everything like the back of your hand but once you do it’s a breeze. Closing shift is the better shift.
good,"making coffee all day learning what specific customers enjoy getting to know them and how there day is the cleaning process of the machines used too, hardest part of the job was probably learning all the ingredients and what or how many pumps or shots too put into ones drink trying to get the daily routine down was probably the hardest part"
good,"•	Acts with integrity, honesty and knowledge that promote the culture values and mission of Starbucks. "
good,"Cleaning and making drinks. Fairly easy. If you have a god manager, you wouldn't have half of the unnecessary issues we had. We never had anything in stock."
good,Fun & busy work environment. Top of the line Italian automatic espresso machines. Benefits for part time employees.  Flexible work schedules; most people are part time.
good,"Starting I worked a full time schedule which I enjoyed the staff and customers, however after a change in management, my hours were drastically cut to less that part time."
good,"Fast pace "
good,Can be a very fun place to work and customer relationships gained is amazing. The fast pace and goals you can set for yourself are definitely satisfying.
good,"I love my job at Starbucks. I wake up excited to go to work. I love the fast pace environment and my partners. But like all other jobs, there are good days and there are bad days. I'm currently looking for a change in pace."
good,"It was very hard to tell the difference in management and barista , they never really took control. I will say the benefits are excellent and it is good for temporary work."
good,"The Keene NH Starbucks is like no other! I love Starbucks as a whole but the Keene NH store is awful. In my 11 months there over 5 people left because of one employee that mangement would do nothing about, this employee is the reason I left ultimately"
good,"starbucks is good company to work for. they have great benefits for employees, such as a pound of coffee weekly, and health insurance. you get free drinks on your breaks."
good,"A typical dat at work at is making drinks, making backup teas and coffee"
good,"Passionate surroundings but certain managers picked and chooses who to appreciate, too personable. The busy mornings were a blast and making a good quality beverage was uplifting."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for and has taught me incredible customer service skills .Connecting with customers in a fast paced environment is the best part about this job. Like any retail position , you're required to work a variety of hours and it can be challenging when moving up in the company if the hours needed are not in your availability which is why I've decided to move on to something more stable and rewarding."
good,"I absolutely love being employed with Starbucks! My regular customers visit and greet me with a smile at all times. It is a fun, fast paced place to be, with something new everyday! Coffee makes me smile, it makes everyone else smile, and I love that!"
good,There will be no days that are same.Customers are loyal. Diffidently that depend on your leader how was your workday  will be. if they organised than it's a pics of cake.
good,une journée de travail typique serait avoir accompli toutes les tàches connexes de l'emploi.
good,It is one of the worst places to work. no breaks low pay for the amount of time and work they expect from you. The department is good and everyone works together but the target stores always seems to think we could do more. bad bad place.
good,"great place to work at"
good,I think that this is a great working environment. there are a lot of new things to learn every day. It is a very fast pace job and the employees are very welcoming.
good,Starbucks coffee is a great place to start gains a great amount of knowledge about coffee and teas family oriented enviornment
good,"I have a love/hate relationship with this company. Years of hard work put in amount to nothing. A long list of great customer and co-worker relationships that culminated in being stuck in a position with no control over your environment or the way you are able to deal with situations. It seems that we are are always being told one thing by corporate just to have it contradicted by the in-person management members at every turn. I love the job, i hate the corporate face."
good,"I loved my job at starbucks. Meeting new people all day was such a neat experience and I never got bored here, but unfortunately I was at a licensed store which means I was not managed by starbucks, but by the Target we were located in. Target management was terrible and I ended up filing a grievance with the company for intimidation and abuse."
good,"Starbucks overall was and is a great company, especially when i lived on a Marine Corp base the hourly pay was a lot better since we were not allowed to receive tips and we were able to make friendly conversations with that of the military personal. However, back in the  civilian world, my hourly wage went down tremendously which took a big tole on my living expenses. I was able to learn so much about coffee and tea that i can take with me anywhere, and help others who are looking to find more information on the products. I think the hardest part about my job as a shift was finding many employees who don't care as much as i would hope about their job or would not want to make the most out of their time on the shift and take pride in their work. A typical day for me is to time manage, delegate tasks, ensure high quality customer service and cleanliness and to be sure necessary tasks were completed in the time given."
good,"A typical day starts by being told where you're needed, identifying what needs to be accomplished for the job to run smoothly, and accomplishing those tasks. Usually we start by stocking up and organizing, cleaning or just re-arranging the station to match your taste. The environment is team oriented where as a team works in conjunction to provide a product/service. I enjoy, most of all the customers and the interactions with them. The job itself is very labor intensive and is way under-paid for how much work is required. I've learned through working in this manner that it's about passion for a quality of service or quality product that drives people to work extremely hard for so little payment."
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks to make connections between the customer and I. My favorite part of working is getting things done on time, working with the people I work with, and making someone enjoy their day just by having a great cup of coffee."
good,"Meet alot of great people working here, also learn about about the coffee industy."
good,"While working at starbucks I learned the importance of team work. When you arrive at work everyone must be doing their job to the best of their ability and must always be communicating with their co-workers. A job like starbucks can feel hectic at times, so working with a team that is positive and with people who push themselves to do well is very important. I experienced a few different managers during my time there, and quickly discovered how much a managers work ethic can affect the success of the store. The most difficult part to working at starbucks it's fast-pace and dealing with hard to please customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with people who make the job fun."
good,I loved this postition it was unfortunate they closed my location
good,I enjoyed the working with my partners and the customers. Work days were long and the physical aspect of the job caused me distress.
good,"management is there for the most part"
good,"Some simple things are out of place but overall goood company  from what I know of working there  , great learning experience and growing experience from anyone"
good,It’s a great place! I was happy working they’re and I was in love with my staff members! The customers that cane through were amazing as well for the most part! definitely a lot of team work!
good,decline to answer and provide feedback on my current place of employment. I am currently trying to find a new job exclusively because I am not given enough hours on the clock at this job
good,"Set boundaries  "
good,"Buen trabajo, creo que no te pagan lo suficiente, tampoco horas extra, ambiente laboral bueno y cooperativo"
good,"Good place to work. Plan on putting in a full day's work. Management is fair to the employees. Pretty good benefits. Free beverages, and a pound of coffee per week for partners."
good,Taking orders and making orders and making sure all customers are taken care of when it comes to them ordering online or in the store always making them happy
good,"It was fun working at Starbucks, I was always learning something new, which I loved that about it. Sometimes it was hard working there as a mother and daughter was the manager and assistant manager, sometimes I felt “ganged” up on. I always tired my hardest and was fully invested in my job, I loved my job. Working with the everyday customers was another plus! I enjoyed listening to Stories about what was going on in theirlives.people"
good,"Great place to work, but it takes long to get an raise, been working there for 8 months haven't yet gotten a raise. Communication is well needed. I will recommend working there but under better management."
good,Overall Starbucks was a cool company to work for . Making different types of coffee & etc . As well as meeting new people everyday making there day better .
good,Great for students with demanding schedules. You get weekly tips which is great for quick cash between paychecks. Free coffee & food and I met some really great people!!
good,"Although the job is really good and with amazing benefits, i's not for everyone. Very fast pace. As well with dealing with all kinds of customers. It does get very stressful some days."
good,"a good job if you need a job that always has something to do. not always the most organized when it comes to staffing, night shift usually understaffed"
good,"A typical work day involves customers first, some prep lots of cleaning. I learned a lot about the products we make, especially our coffees. In my case, management was as management usually is. Shift supervisors of course were the easiest to approach in saying that they themselves did the same jobs we did.  The culture Id say is the best part about working in this industry, you walk in and are a superstar, your there to help people start and end their day and a lot of that brings together a community. It feels like family working with this team and the people who come for their daily pick me ups.  The hardest part of the job is being brand new and not knowing what your doing during a rush.  The most enjoyable part Id have to say is that we get to be apart of the atmosphere and most often we are making the guests day, so there's lots of positive vibes coming from all parts of the job."
good,I really enjoyed working for Starbucks.  Almost every week there was something new for me to learn. I’m middle aged and I loved the diverse culture working in Starbucks.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work as a first job or if you’re just looking for benefits. It’s easy to get benefits there since you only have to work 20+ hours a week and the benefits are great! It can get stressful at times but the job is relatively easy. The biggest con is sucky management. I worked for almost 5 years with Starbucks"
good,not the best but not the worst either. not a job for you if you can’t handle high pressure and stress or angry customers who haven’t had their coffee yet.
good,"This company is great to work for. The pace is fast, there is unlimited avenues to grow however management has to believe in you and push you to grow. A lot of perks behind the scenes of this company are not offered outright but what a terrific company to teach you so many things about customer service."
good,Starbucks is a fast-paced and fun place to meet new people and learn new drinks! I had a lot of fun my time there. However there was poor management and one of my coworkers tried to get me fired but pretended to be my friend. Great first job.
good,"Handled cash transactions inventory, Organized schedules, and Managed a team with over 10members. Great Guest maintain a prompt shift daily with workers and guests"
good,"Being a barista was a fun job, I constantly learned new things and had great regulars. I was able to learn about every single drink on the menu within two days due to the fast paced environment which i enjoyed as well. I Enjoyed staying busy, and learning all the different ways to make drinks"
good,"When I started they were a family focused company that appreciated their employees. Every year they had Christmas training celebrations at the local management offices. Sometime about five years later they decided to do in store training. That got worse and worse. Also, they wouldn't promote from within, but started hiring managers from outside the company with no experience. A 6 week training course can't teach someone how to have a passion for coffee or how to manage people in that kind of workplace. After almost a decade with the company realizing I'd never be promoted I left. Great for high school kids, but not a career move."
good,"Starbucks was a great employment opportunity, i enjoyed the coffee culture and enjoyed learning about the entire coffee process. Short shifts are available for baristas who have busy schedules"
good,It was an overall fun job. I rather enjoyed working there. my only complaints were the management and compensation. Overall though if  I could attain a fair salary I would return with different management.
good,"Worked at a a onroute, we had no benefits that a store would have, manager oversaw 3 stores and had no time for Starbucks. "
good,"It was a good job, nice people, many benefits. Much work to do, cleaning, doing coffee but this was fine. I like working at Starbucks. I truly recommend it."
good,"The partners and customers makes and breaks the Starbucks experience for everyone. Fast paced great coffee, easy to learn. Meeting new people who enjoys great coffee is always a plus."
good,"Company expectations are very limiting and unrealistic, bad management. But the people and connections and lessons that are made as a Starbucks partner are uniquely beneficial and character building"
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for they do have they’re shortcomings but overall a great work experience and the company has opened my eyes to a new world of customer service.
good,very good flexible hours but poor management. working on the till and bar is really fun as youre learning new skills. for long hours such as 8 hour shift lunch break should be longer than 30 mins.
good,"I worked 10 hours a day 2 days off per week. Salary is not enough especially you have families."
good,"This is a great job starting out, they have great benefits even for entry-level employees. If you are an individual capable of picking up concepts fast, able to listen to direction and work under pressure this job will be easy to advance in."
good,"A typical day consists of people in a rush wanting to get their drinks but not wanting to wait for it. I have learned a lot about customers and their love for coffee and some are very picky and others are very uneducated but think they know everything there is to know about coffee and starbucks, but yet have never worked there a day in their life. Workplace culture is OK, if you like working with younger people who are still in college. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the entitled customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the free samples we get to try when theres a new drink."
good,"great place, sadly i had a terrible manager who treated us very poorly and did not care about our well beings, working at starbucks is fun but can be stressful and mentally exhausting. not to mention they expect you to be fast after one week of training."
good,"Having to deal with high maintenance customers, they try and get free stuff sometimes. Must be a quick learner and it's hard to get fired unless purposely trying to get fired."
good,"Open the store, brew coffee, tea, fill espresso machine. put the pastry case back together. made new syrups for the next day greeted guests. everyone works well together. Fun and energetic work environment."
good,"Working with other baristas, makes for an easy day. You have time to speak with them about their daily life when you have down time. There are rushes and peaks of people at certain times of the day. Especially when there is a happy hour or new drink/pastry coming out. The hardest part of working at Starbucks is the expectations of the customers. You will have plenty of regular customers who order the same thing, but you will also have customers who know nothing and ask many many questions."
good,Very casual work environment. Laid back structure in a fast paced environment. You're always moving and learning and interacting with customers. It is a great place to work.
good,"If you need a part-time job that is quick paced with a friendly environment then Starbucks should most definitely be an option. However, I must say the one of the best perks included with the job is being able to sample and taste all of the delicious drinks!"
good,Bien aunque las tabulaciones de salarios no son los mejores.
good,Great place to work if u have the appropriate manager. otherwise it's very stressful and disorganized.which is the current state of this Starbucks with our current manager.
good,"You get to be part of a team."
good,"Flexibility, strong work ethic, morality, and team work are key attributes to help you grow within the company. Utilize the resources starbucks offers."
good,"The training is through and gives you a fair expectation for work there. "
good,i worked a lot. i was not a supervisors because of my car issues but i was still expected to uphold supervisor standards. jessica at malibu starbucks is an awful manager and unfit for the job.
good,A typical day at Starbucks would consist of lots of face to face interactions with customers and coworkers. I learned a lot about time management. Sometimes you get an amazing manager and sometimes you get an awful manager. The work can be repetitive but fun especially when you have fun coworkers. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,Working at Starbucks can be hard if you aren't used to fast paced environments but if you are you should be fine. Depending on the management and location you can end up loving or hating your job.
good,this job was great but it wasnt for me. i couldnt handle working a fast paced job that also had a drive through and stressed me out to work with some not so kind co workers
good,I am very passionate about the Starbucks brand.  I believe in the companies mission asms values.  I habe learned so much from my management team in both good and not so great circumstances.  Unfortunately the hours I need just are not there.
good,"Working at Starbucks can be super stressful! It is an amazing company to work for but being on bar, you do not get a break. Especially if you have drive thru and café to take care of! Your day will go by sooo fast! If you can not be on your feet for more than 8 hours...this job is not for you. For all that baristas do, they really don't get paid much, which sucks. I started out with 8.25...Other than that... Starbucks was an awesome experience! It would be an awesome first job because it shows you how to be quick on your feet, consistent and how to talk to people. The most enjoyable part to Starbucks was the free drinks and getting to taste new ones before they were even out!"
good,Great business overall. The working environment like the management team isn't very professional and the lack of work on the supervisory team is all laid on the baristas
good,"Mornings could be very stressful. Flexible hours. Mostly cleaning/customer service based values. Many perks including 30% discount, a free pound of coffee/k cups/etc every week. One free food mark-out per shift along with unlimited drink mark-outs."
good,This started off as a summer job and I found myself trying to come back and work every change I got. It easy money and once you learn the drinks everything is smooth sailing.
good,This job was more for a younger individual sure it was a fun place to work but some days you just want to get your work done and go home. After standing on your feet all day some days you just want to go home.
good,"-Decent job, but if not full time, then workers can get pushed to the side, and made to feel less important. Feels like a high school job.I wish the management culture was the same across all starbucks'."
good,Starbucks has a regular flow. Peak rush hours where you focus on customers and drinks. Slower times where you balance cleanliness and breaks. The benefits are great and if you engage with fellow partners the time passes quickly. The worst part of the job is just waking up at four in the morning consecutively causing irregular sleep cycles. The menu of drinks is not hard to learn and just takes some practice.
good,"Store Managers are given a workload that requires 55-60 hour work weeks in order to be successful but no one talks about it. There is lots of discussion of supporting your teams development and making them enjoy their work, but the same courtesy is not given to Store Managers who are contacted by their supervisors at all hours of all days. "
good,"I love the people I work with. I love the food even more, but I love getting to know the customers the most. I enjoy the time I spend there because everyone there I can bond with on not only a work level, but a personal level as well."
good,"my only big issue the two years i worked with the company was the management, i made life time friends and was constantly challenged to better myself. was great for one of my first jobs"
good,"People are usually cool, but everything feels last minute and rushed, the turnover is so high that you're always short-staffed. Usually super early mornings."
good,Its a lot of stress. Our store works in a high tourist location. Some of the employees are yelled at for going to slow. but we are the 2nd busiest starbucks in Las vegas.
good,"The Starbucks Environment is amazing; being a manager the partner work experience became a number one priority. Benefits are amazing, hours are not always as high as they could be and scheduling very scattered. A lot of hard labor and cleaning is required."
good,"I love everything the company stands for. My brother, my sister-in-law and my son have worked for the company but we all can agree that the amount of work we do per shift isn't worth they pay. I would be gladly to stay if i was offered more."
good,this job was great. loved working with staff helping customers. Management was ok. hardest part of my job there was get stuff from the back because I'm  scared of heights. I enjoyed seeing  my regular customers.
good,"Typical day was brewing coffee"
good,"Typical work day was very busy, i learned to make multiple coffee drinks. Management was good, coworker were friendly, hardest part is memorizing recipes, most enjoyable was working with different people."
good,I loved the job and the company. The hours weren't bad but the staff and management wasn't the best.
good,Helped with customers with a fantastic team of employees who I am still friends with. The management in the beginning was good and slowly dwindled and everyone quit around the same time or got transferred to different stores due to this. The hardest part about the job was having a smile on your face when people ordered their coffee wrong and then yelled at you about it. The most enjoyable part was working with the staff.
good,I am so happy when I start my day every morning Because I love my job
good,"I loved being a partner, good people, great company cultures."
good,"I loved working for them. However, I don't feel they are family oriented. I was hired and told I would be in a mid day shift which would suit daycare hours. I needed that time frame because I was due to have a baby in Novemeber. Instead of a mid day shift I was placed working nights. I let it go because I was told they could work with me once the baby was born. This did not happen. When I came back from my maternity leave they informed me that they could not accomodate my new availablity. So I am now bettering my education and trying to advance myself in a feild which better suits my skills and peaks my interest."
good,Space for advancement
good,"Fun fast paced environment, meet new people. Clean stock and assist customers."
good,Starbucks teaches you so many things and life lessons that you can take with you for the rest of your life. Handcrafting each and every drink to each customers liking gives you a sense of importance because almost every customer either starts or ends their day with you. The great thing about working a team is we all know that without our customers we couldnt do anything because without that customer repeatedly coming back with have no flow to do what we love. The hardest part of the job is when your new getting people to trust you with their wants and needs like they trust the rest of the team that is seasoned with experience. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that within that one cup up coffee you have played an important part of the customers life and can change anyone with just one cup!
good,I enjoyed my time there. It was Knowledgeable and very fun. The people there were great.
good,Coffee was great. Got a free pound every week. Loved our regular customers. Great experience for someone who was fresh out of high school.
good,"I worked there for about 8 months. As far as the work goes, its very awesome. The customers were always a hit or miss. Either they were extremely nice, or horribly rude."
good,Management wasn't the most appreciated people in the business. I never saw nor spoke to my boss at starbucks after the interview. The customers were lots of fun and always very helpful. Coworkers always needed some self entertainment so there was always drama or conflict. I got old fast. I enjoyed most about starbucks was free drinks and coffee.
good,It is a fast paced environment wherever you apply. But it is a fun job to have especially if you are into coffee. You will learn so much about coffee while having interactions with customers.
good,Love working in a fast paced environment. Drive thru at Starbucks is a commitment that I am happy to be a part of. I have learned how to provide great customer service.

good,This job was great overall and I wish I was not forced to leave due to family issues. I would definitely work here again. The employees worked as a team and no one would be judged.
good,"Corporate employees are well compensated and heavily supported. Licensed and franchise employees do not receive the same experience, I loved working for a corporate store but after moving to a store owned and operated by RPCS, Inc. I saw that it is NOT the same for licensed stores."
good,"Great first job, Would definitely recommend anyone to work here. It helps build character and patience. Perfect for anyone who enjoys a fast pace work environment."
good,this is a great place to work. I liked to make coffee and serve customers with fun coworkers. I would highly recommend this job to anyone who is interested.

good,"Wonderful company, I enjoyed working here. The environment was amazing and they're are extremely accommodating when it comes to personal time or injury."
good,Starbucks is a nice first job and unless you plan on climbing the ladder i would not recommend as a full time job. Even as a part time employee i only get at most 40 hours every two weeks...
good,"Actually loved my time at Starbucks. It has been the management and team, as well as lack of proper advancement channels that has me seeking a different career path."

good,"Good place to work. The job was part time and seasonal."
good,Super fast paced you really have to be a peoplel person and be really fast and good under pressure. You have to have open availability and work during holidays .

good,I love working here as the staff is very friendly and it feels like home. It is fun working in Starbucks as we get to know many customers. Sometimes it gets stressful in the mornings due to long queues.
good,"I have learned so much from working at Starbucks and truly enjoyed getting up for work in the morning. I have made genuine friends and connected with some amazing customers who I still remain in contact with in previous stores I've worked in located in other states. The benefits available to Starbucks partners help me feel secure and able to provide for me as well as my toddler. They also help keep me motivated by offering tuition reimbursement for any major through Arizona University online, which helps create a bright future for my family and I. The people I have worked with have been very friendly and there is a sense of common ground throughout the store and/or the levels of employment. For example, I have made close friends with a previous store manager of mine after we had found out how much in common we had while still keeping our friendship on a professional level. Even after leaving the company they make sure their employees are well taken care of. Starbucks has been the best job I've had so far in my 26 years of life."
good,"They have really great service and even better people. They are open to a bunch of requests, you always get to interact with the customers, and everyone is always nice."
good,"Working for Starbucks was an amazing experience with a fantastic management support group. There were stressful times, as with any job, however the staff always found ways to make situations work. The culture was supportive of any and all types of personalities."
good,Great Company to work with and for....I would highly recommend Starbuck's any day . The people and the customers are the BEST! Everyday was a complete joy! Get on board and get ready for the time of your life.
good,Worked here for 3 years and it was a pleasure. It was like a big family. I worked in the district by Empire State Building and it was the best. I learned so much there and met some of the best people! Starbucks became apart of me!
good,"Oportunidades de surgir y aprender cosas nuevas, buen ambiente laboral."
good,Being about to work here was a nice part time job especially while going to school. They anyone who apply here would enjoy working for this company. Give it a try
good,"Welcoming environment, always something to do to keep busy, you are always learning new things and building new relationships every day with customers and work colleagues"
good,Actually a great company to work for. They were extremely flexible and I felt as though the company itself cared for their workers. I liked the fact that they hired based off potential and not only experience. The company gives everyone a chance.
good,Definitely a great place to gain work experience. Team building and customer service is very important to this company. You get see such diversity in this work setting.
good,"waking up to brew coffee, greet customers and delight each person with what they want and connecting with everyone. Helping partners grow in there role and helping develop them to where they want to be. celebrating small wins and keep the momentum up."
good,"Accommodating company with great benefits. Full and Part Time Employees received benefits that include: health, dental, vision insurance. You receive stock in the company the day that you are hired. 401k options available. Opportunity to attend Arizona State University with reimbursement plan.  Requires strong communication and multi-tasking skills."
good,Great benefits hours aren't consistent. Depending on the store manager you may have a good experience. The restricted stock is amazing. Starbucks supports it's partners.
good,Amazing great company. I had a wonderful boss and loved making drinks. It’s easy to memorize and retain the recipes. Also lots of good benefits for employees
good,"Good, organized shifts. Extremely reasonable and friendly management. Employment was easy except for the early/ morning shifts. The training period was done smoothly too."
good,"Eran bilingues, la gente muy abierta y platicadora. todo bien"
good,"They want you to work very hard and quickly. I worked there for about 5 years and was at 3 different stores. And Bangor felt like the hardest one to work at. The culture wasn't really good, and the manager, although hard working, was not as concerned for her employees well-being or concerned with helping the partners find love in the work."
good,"Pretty good, managers loved me. literally just be a positive working person and you'll be fine! Always for sure full time job or even part time. You pick your hours which is nice. The only thing is that you get annoying customers which their flights delayed and all that but that's bound to happen lol."
good,The job have various skill requirements and you preformed a variety of tasks. You have two to four weeks to train and learn all the recipes before they let you out on your own.
good,Starbucks is a company that pushes you to be the best within the company and outside. They want the partners to achieve and grow and they help with that.
good,I learned about new ways how to make the beverages on cue to finish it as fast i can and i learned how to measure every ingredients that i put into mixture without looking

I learned how to be able to work in a stressful environment. Since I was the trainer and the fastest barista working there. I was often left at the bar by myself with two cashiers taking orders. I had a lot of fun there but unfortunately felt like i was getting paid for the hard work I did there."

good,"I have been working at Starbucks for 3 years and will be leaving once I earn my degree and work in my field of study. Benefits to partners who work 20hrs weekly, time and a half is paid on holidays. Flexible schedule, many available shifts to work, easily switch shifts and ask for days off."
good,My experience working at Starbucks was all I could ask for from team cooperation down to customer interaction. It’s a friendly environment that made me feel more than at home.

good,"enjoyed working there, when it was busy it got very hectic at the bar. Opening was always hard but the team was super helpful so it eased the rush. Highly recommend if you're looking for a first job!"
good,Overall Starbucks was an amazing place to work at. If you’re into fast paced friendly environment this is the place for you. I would definitely recommend Starbucks for anyone.
good,"Never had a problem while working there. The only thing that was a little weird was that manager at my location ended up stealing around $20,000 while i was employed there so there was about 3 months when we didn't have a manager and I wasn't sure who i should go to about my scheduling."
good,"FREE COFFEE. TUITION REIMBURSEMENT. I can't say enough good things about this company. From my manager to my co-workers, it has been the best work environment!"

good,Melhor empresa que já trabalhei  em minha vida ! Perfeita nada a reclamar foi meu primeiro  emprego  ! Super recomendo. ..
good,"Starbucks is a great company with a lot of benefits available. The individual experience will depend on the manager of the store and the regional manager. For a job with minimum skill requirements (I had pretty much none when I applied and very limited availability), it is a good place to start out at and there seemed to be room for advancement. Overall, it was a positive experience and the stores I was at were willing to work with my hours."
good,"Aprendes servicio al cliente, procesos operativos y una metodologia de trabajo americana."
good,"First job which was perfect for me, busy busy store but helped shape me. Amazing fellow employees; especially my manager who I still connect with years later"
good,"Great Workplace Environment "
good,overall i think starbucks was a great job for those that are just getting into the work force. i personally wouldnt make a career out of it but if someone did want to they would be in the hands of a good company with plenty of growth and opportunity.
good,I loved being a Shift Supervisor at Starbucks. I always had fun working with the manager and coworkers. The work culture was all about team work and working together as partners. It was exciting to be able to supervise a team while on shift and getting to know my coworkers and having fun everyday.
good,Working in facilities management for Starbucks was very rewarding as I am able to help with troubleshooting. Once I have resolved their issue and they were able to continue their day it was a great success it gives you great job satisfaction.
good,Me gusto mucho trabajar en esta tienda pues rapidamente aprendí todo lo necesario para ser un buen barista.
good,Tiene un muy buen ambiente laboral en el que el gerente se preocupa mucho por ti.
good,"It was awesome experience to be at a different part of the company, I had a great learning experience there and enjoyed the people I worked with. Definitely recommend this place"
good,it didn’t really pay as well as i thought so i switched to somewhere that i could earn tips at. i also didn’t really like the location i was at too much but the job itself was fun and very enjoyable.
good,fun fast paced work people oriented customer service  i enjoyed working there i made good tips and there were good benifits i would recomend working there.
good,Great for part time job. Customers were great. Had a lot of fun. Would go back as a part timer if I could afford too. My 17 year old wants to work here while attending school and as applied to do so would recommend to anyone.
good,"Starbucks was my dream job right when I got out of high school. I loved coffee from a very young age. The day started at 5:30 am, and continued until I decided to stop consuming coffee for that day. I rang people up at the register from 6 am to 10 am, and after that I would move on to a different task. The management was not poor but it wasn't great. I thought the managers were overall reasonable in their expectations or tried to be fair. The environment was always cold, but I guess this was to be expected. Upbeat, very lively, loud and modern coffee shop environment. If you enjoy coffee and artwork or one of the two, you will probably enjoy working for Starbucks. It was hard for me to consistently stay in one place for a long period of time. This job gave me the confidence to be myself and have a positive attitude while on the job- this is important and good for any job. Since I loved coffee, of course I loved the employee discount, bu I also just liked the smell and the overall experience of going to Starbucks. The best part of my job was seeing the difference smiling in the morning can make to one person."
good,I liked working at Starbucks because I have met people with different personalities. And I love interacting with people from different backgrounds. I would say the hardest part of the job is making the 'idealize' drink for every customer.
good,I love working at starbucks because of the good environment and the employees are friendly. I enjoyed connecting with the customers and that also helps me improve my services to them.
good,Learned time management and valued my customer service skills. Starbucks was able to provide me with the schedule i needed to balance work and school at the time i needed. I believe starbucks is a great starting point for anyone needing a push.
good,I definitely recommend working here. It's a great place to start as a first time job. The benefits are amazing. The only bad thing about working for Starbucks are the customers.
good,The employees will become your Starbucks family and it is worth the stress. You will get to know frequent customers and know their drink order and their life as they become part of your Starbucks family.
good,I loved working for the company. I did work on a Military base so the environment was different. I really enjoyed our customers and my fellow employees. I was a great place to work and I have thought of working their outside of the base.
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun and a place I was excited to go to. My only dislike was your hours are dependent upon when you were hired. My supervisor limited me to 15-20 hours a week because of when I was hired and was considered ""morning shift filler"" it got to a point where I only made enough money to have gas to get to work."
good,Es una empresa donde se preocupan por el personal y sus clientes  tienen todo el sentido de urgencia tanto la calidad de sus  productos como el bien de sus clientes
good,"As long as I got along with my coworkers, as well as management, I felt like a typical 8 hour shift could go by pretty fast due to the fast nature of making drinks."
good,"Great place to work, loved the atmosphere and the customers, that you get to interact with in a daily basis. "
good,unfortunate that the target had to be closed down. other then that great company to work for. learned a lot not only about the work life but working there taught me that no matter where you go there are people out there that are willing to gelp you when you are down.
good,"Very fast paced environment, time flys by, I loved the people i worked with and the relationship building that came with it. I became good friends with a lot of my regular customers"
good,Working at Starbucks was a very fun and formative experience. It enhanced my memory and my people skills. My coworkers and I became like a small family and I looked forward to clocking into each and every one of my shifts.
good,Amazing company to work for with great incentive for partners especially students. Lots of opportunity for growth within the company. Overall amazing.
good,"Absolutely loved the job, and the people I worked with! The only reason I left this company was because I was starting school in a couple of months! Broke my heart to leave my work family!"
good,A great place to work. Fast paced beverage creation and customer service. I enjoyed connecting with customers and creating thier drinks orders. Great opportunity for career growth.
good,"This is a job you'd want to make a career out of but a good way to start off your adult life. I'm currently attending ASU to obtain my business degree and it's thankfully paid through Starbucks. Starbucks also GIVES you stock, 401K matching benefits, health'/dental/vision insurance, FREE education, FREE 1lb of coffee every week, FREE/discounted drinks and merchandise, advancement opportunity, and so much more!"
good,"La principal característica es el ambiente que se maneja entre partners, es bastante bueno y logras disfrutar mucho tu trabajo"
good,What an amazing company too work for. I made many friends and gained valuable experience in my 13 years of employment working this company. I highly recommend this as a job on any level.
good,"Working at Starbucks is more than just offering a cup of coffee, it is creating connections amongst customers and your team mates. "
good,"Good place, very extreme fast pace, would definitely work here again. Breaks are good, lunch is 30 mins, kept fun, always laughing, a lot of good people."
good,Muy buen ambiente laboral compañerismo  buenos consejos
good,Una de las mejores experiencias que cualquiera puede vivir.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, great people and fair pay at my branch at least. The management treated us fairly and provided flexible shifts and benefits."
good,"I loved the speed and multitasking of Starbucks. I got very good at it. They are very diverse and inclusive, over all a very positive company. I totally recommend working for this company. You learn skills that translate to future jobs, like customer service, efficiency, and quality control with speed."
good,I worked here while i was in college and they were so flexible with my hours that way i could still work full time around my school schedule. Very fast paced and a little stressful at times but it made the day go super quick and i made amazing money
good,"I worked at Starbucks while I was in university and I loved it. It's one of the few times in my life that I actually felt like I was appreciated and fairly compensated for my efforts and work ethic. "
good,"great company to work for, it definitely instills a good work ethic and should be a desirable first job for anyone that is looking to make supplementary income especially if they are students."
good,I love working for Starbucks but you do deal with an array of customers and sometimes deal with things that you are not paid enough for such as cleaning an angry customers accidents all over the bathroom.
good,Buena empresa pero pienso que el salario es un poco bajo
good,"good benefits"
good,They were cool I liked the company cool staff. the coffee breaks and food are awesome. benefits are amazing I will work for them again if given the chance.
good,very good company and the culture of starbucks is very good they care about there employee. future with this company is bright . employee have there right .
good,Such an amazing company to work for. It gives you a 401K and schooling as well as discounts. The people you work with are amazing and loving. The customers are usually always nice.
good,"It's a fun place to work with lovely colleges, and make good relationship with customers. It works on my self-confidence.Working at Starbucks is a great job for any new graduate or student."
good,"Overall, I highly recommend Starbucks to anyone looking for an entry level serving position. It's a great environment if you're looking for something team oriented."
good,"Buen clima laboral, facilidad en los horarios para jóvenes estudiantes etc."
good,Being a barista is a customer obsessed job. Your first interaction is personal and your last interaction is satisfying. You get to meet new faces everyday and put smiles on them. It’s a fast paced job with a lot of different tasks at once.
good,"Company has earned its popularity by maintaining a great quality business. Starbucks holds a welcoming environment, is widely available, and serves a variety of menu options. Starbucks has a unique, modern style. Starbucks creates a place fitting to the environment, giving them a truly natural and positive vibe. Locals are most likely to feel at home at their surrounding locations. The employees at every location always fit in perfectly as well. The alternative styles and quirky personalities of Starbucks employees make for authentic coffeehouse vibes."
good,"Fun team environment, awesome growth opportunities/tons of room for growth throughout the company, education bonuses, fun customers, ability to help people everyday"
good,I enjoyed being part of a team dedicated to providing world class customer service which was a challenge in such a fast-paced working environment but it was a good experience.
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work."
good,Was a great place to work I was hoping to become a manager at the roasting plant. I instead dove back into my automotive background and I remembered how much I love working on vehicles.
good,"High paced job that is incredibly fun. The team as a whole felt like one big family. You gain tons of knowledge about coffee, coffee origins, and coffee pairings."
good,Loved my time at Starbucks.  Most of the friends I made there are still my friends today.  Dealt with some immature managers but for the most part I loved coming to work and interacting with the customers.
good,"The only thing wrong about coffee are the customers.  I am not even trying to be mean, but when someone says American Coffee and they are from another country, they could mean three different things (Regular coffee, Americana, etc.).  This applies to almost all coffee names.  No one knows what they are drinking, yet they are very specific when ordering."
good,"Extremely demanding . I like working here with the am amazing manager . It makes thing go by so"
good,Was fun to work at. The management for the most part was easy going. I loved making drinks for people. As far as healthcare i heard they have great benefits. I was just not enrolled in them so i dont know how they work
good,"I loved the atmosphere and people and drinks. Partners get free Spotify. "
good,Très bon environnement de travail
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, not only did they put the customers first but they also made sure employees were well taken care of as well. Working at the highest volumed Starbucks made it a necessity to be urgent and efficient. Being a shift supervisor helped me to build my career in a managerial aspect."
good,"The job itself is not too difficult once you fully under how to makes drinks, and how each role operates. Take the job seriously but just remember at the end of the day, its just coffee."
good,I loved working at Starbucks. I received several promotions and recognition/ awards for my hard work. I recruited several acquaintances to work for the company and developed life long friendships while networking. Physically the job was fairly demanding and you’re on your feet walking or standing 45-50 hours a week. I had a chronic illness that became very serious and had to eventually resign.
good,"Amazing colleagues, forward thinking organisation and an inspiring mission. A very exciting place to be right now. The company is making great strides and has hired really great people who are developing well. Really enjoying it at the moment."
good,"I had a great time my coworkers and store manager were very nice and helpful. Customer's were for the most part nice. Once in a while you would have a customer who is picky or angry, but that's in every workplace when you are in a customer service position. I would recommend to work at Starbucks as a part-time. It works great with your school schedule if you go to school. I left Starbucks because I moved and was offered a managing position for a different company, but this is a good place to start developing work skills. Everyone has different experiences, but at the end of the day you can't control what is around you, but you can control how you react to it."
good,"Awesome place good benefits....stick options.,....all of it......good people....plenty of opportunities if you want to advance in other areas of site..."
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work. They work as a team and the people who work there are very encouraging to everyone. If you work hard, you are rewarded and recognized for it in many different ways."
good,"The manager is amazing, and participates as an entry level employee. All of the workers are easy going and fun to work with. I never go to work not wanting to be around a certain person. Overall it is a great place to work."
good,"overall is a great experience "
good,"A great learning environment where everyday you interact with partners and customers. As a partner you strive to connect with customers, be welcoming with a genuine approach, be involved in the community and follow high standards to food safety and cleanliness."
good,It's a great company to work for! The customers are always the highlight of the day next to unlimited free coffee. If you have a good manager and get promoted it could be a lucrative decision to work there. Try it if you want. It was on my bucket list. The products are a cultural phenomenon.
good,I worked with some amazing people who taught me a lot about patience and caring for others! Being a  barista is more tha  making coffee - it is about making connections
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work with a lot of opportunities for advancement. I learned a lot of skills in scheduling, inventory control, training new partners and cash handling. The hardest part of my job was the customer volume during peak times and ensuring high drink quality with the speed to get the customers out and on with their day. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my coworkers and my customers leaving with a smile."
good,Starbucks is one of the few corporations that shows any sort of concern for the well-being of its employees.  Always looking to improve regardless of costs or efforts.  This is a great place to work as a first job or a part time job while going to school.
good,good benefits fun job nice hours okay management you should work there its so cool its the best job you will ever have omg but that it be carful they are a lot of rules
good,Love working at Starbucks staffs always friendly and professional. Alpharetta crossing Starbucks is like a home. The customers are treated like family even the new ones. Partners there are quick and friendly.
good,It is a good job however not something I would care to make a long trem career. This job is useful to make some extra money on the side especialy while earing a degree.
good,Starbucks is an amazing place to work and no matter who you work with the team is really flexible and I will always remember my days here and will recommend to anyone
good,Starbucks is a fun lace to work with good benefits but not the type of place to expect a long-term career. Advancement opportunities are few and far between.
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, I received great interactions with my coworkers and managers, I always felt comfortable in my work place. It was very fast paced and fun to work for."
good,"Starbucks focuses heavily on customer satisfaction, be it through interactions with Baristas or the quality of their drink(s). I had A LOT of fun working there. I caution that sometimes employees dont really care, but there are DEFINITELY a lot who do and will stay with the company for very long. Cool job to have for a while unless you're planning on moving up. Know it's a slow process, but worth it from what I've been told."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks in the summer is busy from 9-11am, then it's dead until about 3-5pm. Then it's pretty much dead until we close the store. Since working there, I have learned how to work with others as a team but I have also learned more patience in dealing with customers."
good,"Great experience, good benefits. Depending on where you work, good opportunities to advance with the company. Easy to transfer with company anywhere you want to go."
good,A typical day at Starbucks could definitely get stressful but only if you let it be. With the right management and attitude every day can be great all day. And that applies to any job. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be the connections you make with the customers and seeing their faces light up when you remember their order or even ask about their day. It's the little things.
good,I would recommend anyone to work at Starbucks because for me it was a fun and exciting experience. The hardest part of the job is probably keeping up with drinks
good,At that job you always had to stay busy so you always had to find something to do. I liked it because I always had something to and the time would pass by fast.
good,"Great benefits at this company, typical day was coming in mid day to take over for the mid-shift and making sure the baristas on shift were able to handle the customer orders."
good,"Starbucks, especially at a high volume store, is very stressful. A barista is in charge of cooking food, making drinks, cleaning, dishes, food pulls, and putting away orders as well as restocking. The managers at Starbucks are very competent in their job and strive to give you the hours  you request as well as the time off you request. The hardest part of the job is learning all the different drinks and then complying to all the extra requests for them, but thankfully coworkers make it a lot more fun and easy to learn these drinks. Overall a great place to work if you don't mind stressful rushes and enjoy being part of a team."
good,Always fast paced. Great environment over all. Managers very attentive. There was always an opportunity for growth and the support to make that happen.
good,They’re a great company to work for! They are very fair and all the people you work with are accepting and fun. The managers are also very fair and are willing to help you with anything.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, especially if it is your first job. Not only do they offer flexibility with your schedule, but they also have great benefits!"
good,"They stand behind their word, have systems that benefit everyone. Hard working. Love getting ahead, effort is rewarded.  Goal driven, follow through, time manangement is taught"
good,"I personally loved my time at Starbucks the team members I worked with are now established friends who I will cherish for a long time. It seems unfortunate to me that I should seek to find employment elsewhere because I truly do love the job. Unfortunately, I feel as though my manager looks over much of the work that is done there. This is not to say that I am the only person who deserved a promotion there, in fact, there were a few people who deserved it more than me despite how hard I worked; and ultimately the person who got the promotion when the day came, should have been at the bottom of the list."
good,"I enjoyed working at starbucks. Good Company with great training. The training they provide is great, specially when dealing with customer and their orders. i enjoyed it"
good,I liked working for Starbucks. They have great benefits and help with your college after being there for a certain amount of time.They also will work with you as much as possible to see that you can achieve your education while working for them.
good,"Depending on the volume of your store and the style of your manager, this job can position you for growth and development into any leadership or management role in the future. There are a lot of responsibilities so time management and staying focused is key.  I highly recommend this job for anyone who loves a fast paced work environment, gets bored easily and has a passion for customer service."
good,"In my time of working at Starbucks, I learned an incredible amount on the art of espresso, customer care and connection, and ethics in business. Almost all stores I worked in were friendly and welcoming. The benefits this company has to offer are beyond comparison to any other company in this field.Free online college is offered, health care, stock in the company, and more. The experience allowed me to grow as not only a person but as a team member. Management was helpful and supportive, understanding and patience, while still assertive and focused on better the store constantly. I would 100% recommend working here. I would love to go back one day."
good,"I learned over the years that the experience depends on who the Store Manager is and what they have to bring.  I had a Store Manager who was committed to ensuring all policies were followed and that we all got along which resulted in me wanting to go to work every day.  Then, I moved cities and transferred to another store where I did not have the same experience."
good,Very high paced environment but had a lot of fun working there. My managers were very kind and able to guide me through the work days. Never felt overworked or underappreciated.
good,"everything is good...good work life balance"
good,"Working at starbucks has been an invaluable experience for me. These arent coworkers to me at this point, they are family. I cant think of any other workplace culture quite as positive or personally motivating."
good,"It was a great job to work during the time I went to school. It gave me fundamental experience in working with customers, a team, and a high-stress environment."
good,I learned leadership skills and how to handle a bad situation.  the people I worked with became like family to me and it was over all a great place to work and be.
good,"Good company for progression !!! "
good,"Wage could stand to be higher given the area. But I love it overall. Benefits are amazing. World class. Free coffee every week.  You earn vacation time per hours worked, so it could be a lot depending on how much you work."
good,"I fairly enjoyed my hours of work they were not to harsh and I kept up with the fast pace rush hours during the day along prepping for the next shift in a timely manner. Managers always seem to be on the hunt for someone to mess up and confront in public."
good,Starbucks does a good job caring for their employees. They do a great job always adding benefits and are constantly looking to increase the value of working for Starbucks.
good,"Working for Starbucks was the greatest job I have had to date. From the first day to the last I felt taken care of. Though there were challenges in all sizes, the company provided ways through those challenges that helped me become a happy and more accomplished Partner. All the leadership I had was second to none. The Company strives for greatness, from the top to the bottom. I am so thankful for my time there. It shaped how I live my life everyday. Lessons were learned that benefit me not only in a career sense but also in a human living life sense. Once a Starbucks Partner, always a Starbucks Partner."
good,Great place to make connections with customers. Learning how to work in a fast pace environment is easy when making yummy drinks! Lenient dress code and awesome employee perks.
good,I have loved being a partner for Starbucks. Their company values and mission perfectly align with my own personal values and personality. Creating a warm environment comes naturally to me and has made me truly enjoy working there every day. Free coffee is a great bonus!
good,Loved this company. Love their mission and values and how dedicated to the community they are. I   never had a issue with any of the leaders that I   have worked with. Great company overall.
good,I would recommend this job to anyone ages between 18 and 21. This is a phenomenal college job. The number people that have touched my life since working here is unmatched.
good,Starbucks was one of the easier jobs I have had. I learned that a smile can brighten someone's day and that there are many ways to spell peoples' names.
good,"Starbucks is a very good company to work for. The benefits are great and the people you work with are great. Most of the time to costumers are difficult but the regulars who pour their heart into you make up for it. Starbucks teaches you how to work at a fast and efficient pace. It teaches you how to communicate with not only your costumers but your co workers, which is so highly important. Benefits are offered to part time employees too. They pay for your schooling through ASU online and give you stock options."
good,"Otima empresa, com remuneraçãoo compativel ao mercado"
good,"This job is for someone who can handle the pressure in multitasking. Its very fast pace and you have to remember a lot, overall the job was cool I learned a lot about coffee I didn’t know before, being a barista was pretty nice. Make sure you pay good attention to everything because it’s definitely needed. Little mistakes make a big difference when dealing with coffee."
good,"If you love coffee culture and want to grow quickly within a company, it is very possible for you to achieve great places with Starbucks. The work can be rough but fun."
good,"Typical retail and barista type of job. Constantly interacting with customers and making coffee. They're big on values and connecting with the community, so the scene is fairly corporate but depends on the store's location and management."
good,"Relaxed environment. Management is flexible. Free coffee. Job is easier than most, more relaxed. Most enjoyable part is probably helpful coworkers and minimal management overhead."
good,"I absolutely loved my job working at Starbucks. It was my favorite job that I ever had! I hope I have another opportunity to work for such an amazing company! I love high stress work environment, staying on my toes, and most of all serving the community"

good,"I loved working for Starbucks. As a barista, one can expect a very quick-paced day! This position will definitely teach you skills such as multitasking and how to up hold high standards as far as customer care!"
good,"This was a great company to work for, great management and a fair work environment. As well as great opportunities, for advancement in the company. This company also gives its employees the availability necessary for your school or child care needs."
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at Starbucks. It was a little stressful at times, but overall it was a great place to work. The only reason I left was that I transferred schools and the Starbucks by my new school wasn't hiring."
good,"Underpaid, Under-appreciated by most of your client base, but what makes the job worth it is my co-workers, the regulars, and the one person who's day I get to make. The job is not physically demanding, aside from being on your feet for 4-8 hours a day, but mentally taxing at times. Corporate always wants more from us, without paying more, and overall we happily oblige. Experience varies from store-to-store depending on management. Steep learning curve, but when you got it, you're good. Everything needed to succeed is there, just need to bring a winning attitude and a smile. I am happy to come to work."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for over all. They have many benefits and are a very friendly environment.  It is perfect for anyone who is looking for a steady job
good,Interacting with customers on a daily basis and getting to know everyone in the neighborhood is one of the most gratifying parts of the job. While at the same time working with others who make the workplace fun and enjoyable is also a great part of the job.
good,Awesome crew to work with unless you get scheduled with the clique people. The location I was at is consistently busy being across the University of Oklahoma.
good,Its a fast paced environment that requires you to talk to your customers and serve with speed. Depending on the store will you have a drive through and the ability to multi task. The people are nice the team is nice. Hardest time of the days are the rushes (depending what time the rush is) and the Happy Hour days which usually falls on a Thursday once or twice a month.
good,"Fast paced and I love fast paced work settings "
good,"Fun and rewarding place to work with great benefits, schedule, and perks. Great for students, or people looking for some extra income. great work environment."
good,"Fast pasted and enjoyable. Starbucks baristas perform several job duties and provide customer service. Baristas at Starbucks take orders and make coffee, tea, and other drinks to customer specifications. Starbucks baristas may also operate cash registers and credit card machines"
good,"it's okay if you want to work in that industry for the rest of your life making $10 an hr, which really isnt worth it for how many people go off on you daily"
good,I enjoyed my experience working for Starbucks. Employees were treated with respect and courtesy. I would recommend Starbucks to someone looking for a job.
good,"Often times management was too nice when it mattered, one girl who worked there for 8 months preformed at a trainy level and was never repremanded. The job itself was extremely satisfying as giving a customer a drink and having them say it's perfect was a great feeling. Cleaning isn't hard, learning the drinks isn't either, but from my experience it was awful to work for 2 people instead of just myself."
good,"They offered many opportunities for flexible scheduling, decent pay, and a fun atmosphere to work at everyday.  The customers were always a joy to work with!"
good,"typical day at work would be slow or fast, depending on the crowd"

good,"amazing place to work, one of the best jobs I've had."
good,Starbucks was a very good learning opportunity for me. All of my coworkers were very nice and helpful when  did not know my way around. I eventually learned how to do lots of things at once like make drinks and take drive thru orders all at the same time.
good,I learned how to work with all different kinds of people including customers and coworkers. I was able to move up into a Shift Leader position where I helped in front and back of house while also overseeing daily activities carried out by baristas.
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun for the most part. It is a very fast paced, busy work environment and can be stressful at times. I learned a lot about the coffee industry and the benefits were amazing. Management could have been better, which was a big reason that i ended up leaving. Very unorganized and there were always issues with scheduling each time a new schedule was made. I did thoroughly enjoy the customers. I was always able to walk into work knowing i would have a good laugh, enjoyable conversation, or be able to put a smile on someones face every day."
good,"Depends on the location, but an overall good experience. Most locations are enjoyable with a very warm energetic environment, but not at the Brookefield Place location. They make you feel like a robot working there, especially if you're new."
good,"the people were all really friendly, you learned alot about different coffee types and you also got to taste test them all so you know what youre selling which i think was a neat idea. gotta know your product."
good,"Working at Starbucks, they encourage you to get your education, but only as long as they get most of your time in the process. Otherwise they threaten to fire you because you're not profitable enough for them."
good,Loved the job. Time went by fast. The reason I left is because I got a job in my career field that would help me get further into my career. If I had to work at Starbucks again I would because I liked it.
good,"For m first job I enjoyed my time there, the experience was great and was ableto meet a lot of people. I loved the hands on work and interacting with costumers. Made time go by fast since we were busy most of the time."

good,It was a really good place to work. I highly enjoyed it. I liked making coffee for customers. It laid a foundation for me to be a hard worker in the future.
good,"Best per-hour corporation I ever worked for. Benefits for part-timers as well as full time and a top-notch company culture. I've worked for several other nation companies, and none made you feel as much a part of what you did."
good,"Exchangeable roles between the team which provided us very different soul than any other places , "
good,great people and great vibe but much trouble with management as far as ego trips are concerned. Not much attention paid workers needs when it comes to scheduling and not much attention from anyone in higher management.
good,"Productive & fun workplace"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to learn customer service, time management, multitasking, organizational skills and many more. A difficult but rewarding job with a lot to learn and master."

good,Great workplace culture. Lots of support to learn position and advancement opportunities available.  Coworkers and managers make or break the enjoyment of the workday.
good,Great company to work for. A lot of hard work. No one leaves starbucks because of the company but its always because of horrible management. Offers great benefits
good,"Starbucks was my second job, and I loved it. The employees and management were great people to know and I really enjoyed the work atmosphere. I would recommend anyone to work there."
good,Always productive always had great reviews on our customer service. The only thing that was poor was the communication between employees with their personal issues .
good,i loved working at starbucks as it was a very friendly and energy filled environment. every body in my team was so helpful and even though it took me a while to adjust everybody was very helpful
good,I loved my job at starbucks. my location had it all drive thru and exclusive clover products. also an evening store which is not common. it is very quick paced. no down time and always moving. management at my location could have been better but my team and company were amazing over all
good,"Although I still enjoy Starbucks coffee & always have, working there has def changed the way I view the company. I wish the people & other supervisors had the same passion for Starbucks that I did, unfortunately not."
good,Starbucks is truly an amazing company to work for. It does require a lot of hard work and effort but you get out what you put in. I have met a lot of great people through working here and would definitely recommend to anyone ready to care about a great job.
good,"I started with Starbucks in a different state. When I transferred with the company to the Evansville area, I was crushed to realize this district was not at all a reflection of the company I knew Starbucks to be. "
good,Great company to work for. Benefits are awesome for part time and full time partners. I enjoyed the relationship I’ve built with my customers and partners over the years.
good,"I absolutely would recommend working here to anyone with an upbeat and outgoing personality as the customers and partners are gold and it is very rewarding. Physically demanding, nothing easy about it. Definitely a lot of fun. I wish I didn't have to leave because the pay but it worked for a while."

good,"Every Starbucks I worked at had an excellent team, management, and customer base. I enjoyed learning about everything coffee related and sharing that knowledge with my customers."
good,Starbucks Coffee has created an incredibly supportive work environment for its employees. Trainings required before and during employment allow for employees to maintain the highest standards of customer service.

good,Great fast pace learning environment. The people are great and customers are always willing to hold conversation. You could get lost if you're not paying attention.

good,"Taught me how to wake up very early, create a schedule and habit for myself. Taught me great customer service and how to problem solve in the face of difficult situations. I had great supervisors, manager and co-workers who made coming to work enjoyable. Hardest part was learning all the drinks and steps on doing certain positions but you can learn quickly if you try and are motivated."
good,"This is only my specific on-campus store, I had a horrible manager, and we were not paid the normal wages that Starbucks workers receive. It was also a very catty work environment, but the costumes were amazing."
good,"My manager was always trying to make it his way and not the original starbucks way. I loved the people I worked with, great atmosphere for sure. Everyone was always joking and getting along until the boss would tell us that we weren’t allowed to be communicating on the floor and that we couldn’t dicuss personal things even if we wanted to just vent. I had a really rough time at one point and my boss gave me trouble for almost going suicidal said that work and life should be different and not to bring your problems into work."
good,"Great benefits for all ages (401k, free spotify, free college via ASU)"
good,Excellent General Managers and partners working in each of the 15 locations in Central Texas.  The market is a satellite market with little corporate support.

good,"Being a barista isn’t super easy, you have to remember a lot of ingredients and work in a very very high pace environment. I worked at the Starbucks inside of the Nashville airport so there was a line out the door before we even opened! Got paid well and made tips."
good,I would not like to write a review of Starbucks Coffee company at this time. It was a great place to work at the time for me. I think they are a great company
good,Work was often relaxed and fun even during rushes. If you have an uptight manager it can be very stressful. Tips were always good to get and use for lunch or gas money. The pay was somewhat low but expected. And the discounts and perks were good to have. Hated coming home smelling like coffee all the time.
good,"My experience at Starbucks was nothing short of great! I always had a good time there, and the other employees always had a good time and we all worked as a team, no ME stuff. "
good,"I have always felt empowered while working at Starbucks.  Who doesn't love coffee and the customers."

good,Starbucks was by far the best job that I have had while in college. The work environment is very relaxed. The co-workers and managers are very  friendly. Highly recommended.
good,"Very friendly and optimistic workplace. Motivation at every turn and a lot of opportunities. Teaches a number of skills to all employees seeing as every person does every position (i.e. cashier, dishwashing, making drinks)."
good,I started at Starbucks in college and wound up as a store manager. The hours were long and pay not great but competitive for similar positions. The benefits were far better for similar positions. Flexible hours and fun atmosphere.
good,I had a child and needed more money to support both of us. So I left the job I loved for one with more money and benefits. That I hated and made me really depressed I would love to find a job like Starbucks again
good,"Fast pace enviorment, sometimes overwelming without a supporting management team. This company is overal a great place to learn and grow  In many different areas"
good,It is a great company to work for. They make sure you get breaks and they also tip you out if you are a barista. The hours are flexible with school and if you have another job.

good,"Working at starbucks is the best job you can get as a college student, straight out of high school.  It was my first job and a great introduction into customer service and hospitality."
good,There was ample training and there were many advancement opportunities. For their sector of the industry Starbucks was ahead of its time by offering health insurance.
good,Everyone is willing to help you and you can work at any location. So it's like one big network family. They have amazing benefits as well. It's a great place to work.
good,"If you love coffee, meeting new people, and the opportunity to make a difference in people's daily routine by creating the third place then Starbucks is the place for you."
good,I loved working at Starbucks as they really invest in their employees. They want you to grow within your role and be more than just a barista. They educate you on the different blends of coffee and how quality is what drives the company. I made long lasting relationships with my co workers which was definitely my favourite part.
good,"Typical day consists of brewing coffee, preparing food, and additional tasks that consist of restocking and helping to keep Store clean and organized."
good,"I really loved this job, It was a amazing place to work, from my fellow co workers to the mangers everyone was amazing I would really recommend working here"
good,starbucks is a great work place it always keeps you busy and helps you learn a lot of great skills. typical day is to have certain tasks done by a certain time all while providing great customer service.
good,Pavilions sucks. People constantly gossiped and spread rumors about everyone. Toxic environment. The Starbucks booth itself was wonderful it was just the grocery workers who made it stressful.
good,"I learned so much in this  Industry it was a place where I was excited to visit even when I was off. I lost my mom during the course of me working there and had to move, The company helped me pay for an apartment which was a blessing because I didn’t have a lot of money saved."
good,"Great place to work, loved the people I worked with. Loved having regular customers who came in, and loved working the drive through so I could give the dogs puppaccinos"
good,"I enjoy working at starbucks, it can be very fast paced at times and sometimes stressful. But it is a very fun work environment and even exciting. The only con would be the amount of hours i get."
good,A fun and productive place to work. With a lot of cool and friendly people with a lot of room for growth and change to make it a career that can be happy with.
good,"Great place to work in high school. Coworkers are fun and always make going in a joy. Although there is a tone of work that has to get done when closing. Cleaning everything on top of helping a tone of customers is not fun. It is constantly busy and you only get one 10 minute break. For the amount of stress we are put under and stuff that has to get done, the pay is not worth it.  Wish the company focused on making their barista's happy, since we are the first ones to interact with customers."
good,"District managers and higher ups are amazing. Some store managers lack professionalism. They definitely back up their employees and have a great support system for the most part. Partners for the most part are also great, but also seeing a lot of people that don't to work. Fun environment"
good,"A lot of one on one with customers, memorizing the usual customers orders and multi tasking was KEY. Never got a complaint of my work ethic, I was always free to take over someone calling in sick."
good,"Throughout the two years, I enjoyed working and growing with the company. Great management and really put customers first all the time. Schedule was also flexible"
good,"El trabajo en equipo es esencial para tener un buen despeño en tu trabajo, el saber relacionarte con la gente y tener liderazgo en cualquier situación"

good,"buen ambiente laboral, se aprende mucho y se crea buen equipo laboral."

good,Lack of employment growth/opportunity; nonflexible hours. Inability to understand recent management. Enjoyed fast paced environment and employee benefits.
good,Starbucks was a great company to work for. You can tell that the people up top really care about the jobs satisfaction of their employees and also their customers.
good,Everything depends on the partners but at least is a good company to work.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Starbucks, and getting to learn all the different things that makes Starbucks what it is. I enjoyed my co-workers, but the most enjoyable part was getting to meet the regulars and seeing them almost everyday."
good,There was never a dull moment around the store and there were not very many complaints about any of the people working there. It was a positive environment with everyone helping each other out.
good,"I started working at Starbucks in college.  Benefits were good and pay was serviceable with 15-20 hours a week.  After I moved out and finished school, pay was no longer sufficient with less than 35 hours."
good,Fun environment to work. Benefits available for both part time and full time employees. Lots of memory work but the company provides lots of training.
good,SO super fun. great for networking. fast paced environment. tough work but great benefits package. loved the connections i made here both with customers and coworkers.
good,A typical day at work was fun but the management would get annoying. he would always get in the way and tell us to do things that were not how they were supposed to be done. but the team environment help to alleviate some of the stress.
good,Amazing environment with amazing customers. Never a day that I regret making the leap into becoming something with this company. This company and store has treated me with nothing but love and respect and brought me in with open arms as a kid coming out of high school.
good,"Normally Starbucks is a casual, fun place to work. They do have these ""rush"" hours or peak hours where it's a bit more fast paced but once those settles, it's a lot more relaxed. You also get to make your own drinks!"
good,"Target is a great company to work for, if you are young and have a drive to work then this is a great place to start, or if you are looking for a little extra money this is ot."
good,"It was definitely a good place to work, very supportive environment in which to grow in.  I felt like I developed some good teamwork skills here and achieved some skills."
good,Take the time and learn about everything Starbucks actually offers employees.  20+ hours a week qualifies you for full-time benefits that more than compensate for (what may seem to be) low hourly pay.  Total compensation package is more than generous to those savvy or inquisitive enough to learn about it.
good,"I loved working there and interacting with the regulars and new faces, I was one of the best Barista's at my store, I thoroughly enjoyed making coffee, tea, etc.  The manager of that store is the only thing I would change because she is rude, impulsive, and plays favoritism."
good,"Keeping impatient or short-tempered customers happy especially when the wait time is long is the hardest part of working at Starbucks. This is a fast-paced environment which requires constant moving, problem solving skills, and a positive attitude."
good,"My experience at Starbucks was short because of a concussion I suffered and I never ended up finishing my training, however, I felt that it was an amazing experience, and such a great company."
good,"The culture of Starbucks is great, the benefits, the coffee, the customers.  The person who is a manager at my store is young and inexperienced.  He is not able to connect with community organizations in a professional manner.  He is unclear about his role and so the newer employees are not trained very well, and the feedback he gives to workers about policies and procedures is often indirect and ineffective. The hardest part for me is that when I go to my boss with a problem I'm having or just an observation about another employees performance (as I'm not a manager, I can't coach people about how to do their job) he often sees it as a personal complaint.  He will either tell me hes sorry I'm stressed out, or he will go right to the worker and tell them what I said, using my name and making it seem like the feedback is not coming from him but from me."
good,"Customers love to interact with their baristas, so it's important to be social for this job. Requires being able to work in a fast-paced environment and think quickly."
good,Starbucks has great employee benefits and is an amazing company. Treats their employees well as well as has a great customer service ethic and policy which is the most important thing in any field of work
good,LOVE working with Starbucks for a quality job as a college student. I appreciate the encouragement and openmindedness that I receive every shift. I also love the incentives.
good,"Work is fun but hard work. You MUST be able to multi-task and handle high-stress situations while keeping your cool. The team behind the counter becomes a family and once you get the hang of it, it becomes very fun to work."
good,Loved the customer and client interaction.  I also loved how fast paced and busy I was.  Enjoyed meeting new cliente and it was great that I was always busy as I love challenges.
good,Excellent place of work and very committed people. The manager was very nice and friendly. I was able to learn many things about coffee and business behavior.
good,we're always having fun and laughing at work i love the company but not my store manager. we dont get enough hours to pay bills so a lot of us have multiple jobs in order to live.
good,Definitely a great job for high school and college students. Pay was fair and included tip as well. Free drinks and free meal every 5 hours of work. Hours were flexible.
good,Great place to work lots of benefits a positive attitude gets you a long way.  They have a culture of family and coming together to make the workplace a good place to be
good,Great environment with a wonderful community feel. It is a fast paced job and you have to learn how to multitask and work under sometime stressful conditions. I loved the people I worked with. I wish the hours where more constant and stayed the same day to day.
good,This job was my favourite because I get to talk to a lot of people and learn a lot of things about customer service and about preparing coffee and other coffee shop like products.
good,Extremely friendly atmosphere with hardworking yet easygoing peers and fair supervisors. Always kept clean by the employees. Extremely organized management that did their best to ensure smooth sailing of the store.
good,"Manager was great, people were good. customers were pretty nice. tips were GREAT. The area was nice. I don't have many complaints about this job. If I could go back and pick I would choose to work in the morning. Night time involves a lot of cleaning."
good,"I was able to work and complete my degree as a full time student. Starbucks' benefits took care of me with full health and dental, flexible hours and benefits towards my schooling. "
good,"Providing customer service, This includes opening and closing the store, supervising employees, delegating responsibilities, training baristas as needed and developing positive relationships with the staff. The shift supervisor also should recognize the accomplishments of staff members with positive reinforcement. Ensuring proper cash management and cash register policies is another important part of the shift supervisor's job."
good,"Such an upbeat environment. I've never wanted to continue working for a company as bad as I've wanted to with Starbucks. In my experience, the hour situation won't work with my new situation"
good,"Over the past year, I enjoyed my time at Starbucks. It provided many benefits for my wife and I in a time when we were in need of them. The store manager is very personable, and deeply cares for her employees as people first and employees second."
good,"Relax fast pace job have to be alert at all time , make sure you work safe and the are you work is clean . Friday people if you are fast . The customer is always rite"
good,I Had a challenge to make sure to keep up with customers needs. Also had a great deal of fun running the crew I did they made the days fun and entertaing.
good,Received exceptional customer service tactics and ability to multi task in a high stress environment. This is a great first job. It sets a real good foundation for an amazing employee.
good,"Although it can be a bit hectic to work at Starbucks normally I leave every shift happy, it’s a good place that lets you meet new people. My coworkers are some of the greatest people I’ve ever met"
good,"I learned to remain calm while rush after rush came in. My manager was responsible and worked as hard as I did. We got tips, 2 drinks and a meal every day, regardless of how long our shift was."
good,I loved working at Starbucks as a company and the employees were great. I got along with the customers well and it was fun being able to make drink for people and make them smile
good,"It's a good job, with many benefits. I like the inclusion of different cultures and the comfortable and easy going people I work with. I also enjoy making drinks"
good,"–  Planejamento e organização de equipe, fidelização de clientes, controle orçamentário e fechamento diário, treinamento de baristas, controle das atividades do estabelecimento, elaboração de relatórios diários."
good,L'équipe m'a très bien formée et m'a accompagnée tout au long de mon parcours dans cette entreprise.
good,"Great place to work at. Fun, fast paced, entertaining. It's a lot of fun having to interact with different customers and giving them their orders and watching them enjoy it."
good,Starbucks was a very good place to work. it showed me how to become a leader and how to multitask and I was able to learn how to lead a team and pay attention to detail.
good,Working here was a great experience. The company had great benefits and the management at the store was very helpful in helping me grow professionally.
good,It was stressfull and at times employees not treated the best by customers and company but we recieved good benefits and it works well with individual schedules. I love the partners and I have learned to remain calm in stressfull situations
good,i loved when the line was long and i could move the most fast and get the line down. if i had a different manager and got more money for the efforts and sweat i put in i would have stayed.
good,Good Company to work for. I would recommend this job to others intersted or for someone new starting in the work force. This iis a good starter job for someone out of highschool.
good,Its a super fun place to work. Everyone has a fun personality and for the most part all the customers are friendly. The company takes really good care of its employees. Learning how to make all the drinks is fun.
good,The experience working at Starbucks was very fun and learned many new skills along the way. I would recommend people working here because of the friendly work environment.
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work and I thoroughly enjoyed making the drinks that customers want. I also enjoyed connecting with customers and making them happy giving them their cup of joe every day. Even the regulars and I became good friends after I had learned their drink. It was a great experience and I would love to do it again.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work with, it cares a lot for its partners and the workplace is great, Learning a lot about handling customer relation"
good,Great company to work for. I would recomend working at Starbucks. Competitive compensation. The company will help pay for school. Excellent benefits and perks.
good,it was a fun place to work because the co workers were ok. you have to learn good people skills and communication cause costumers are mean. the hardest part is submitting to the monotony
good,starbucks was only ok. it depends on who you work with for if its a good work day which I think says enough. basically you do just the same tasks everyday
good,happy workplace and there ara a lot of learnings.. as well as sorruonded by people who will hone you to develop professional skills. great management.
good,"Starbucks honestly is an amazing company. It was my first fore into the work place, right after college while I was living with my parents, to earn a little extra cash. I was looking into their long-term programs and training when I received a job offer with better pay. Otherwise, I'm sure I would've completed my masters through their program (they pay for specific degrees) and would've continued my employment with them."
good,"I Liked it, Just not for me! I loved the environment but I never intended to stay there long term! I love the people, management, and everything to do with it."
good,"Great Place to work, enjoyable to work with people you know, fun to drink coffee all day, nice to meet regulars, positive leaders from the higher ups to those you work with daily"
good,"muy buen ambiente de trabajo.  "
good,"Trabajar en Starbucks fue una experiencia inolvidable, aprendí mucho sobre la cultura del café, la preparación del mismo y sobre el manejo de caja."
good,"I've been with this company for a couple years now and it's been a roller coaster. I've been promoted and recognized as Partner Of the Quarter twice, which are great achievements. Unfortunately I've also experienced a multitude of bad things involving both my Store manager and District manager. Although I've proved myself competent and hard working I've had unnecessary backlash from higher up management. I stay with this company for the many opportunities to transfer, aquire benefits, and remain with a stable well paying job. The people I work with are amazing and the customers can be difficult but overall it's a good company and they truly care for their employees."
good,"Working experts that keep each store running like clockwork. Managing a shift, running a team and making store operational decisions, they develop leadership skills for the future. They role model and coach the delivery of high-quality service while creating meaningful connections with my customers and partners."
good,I loved working at Starbucks! The job was fast pasts and could be a tad stressful at times. The partners at Starbucks were always incredible and everything was run very smoothly.
good,"The job can be really fun, depending on the team you work with. Extremely boring once business slows down. If you enjoy fast paced jobs and can multitask this is the job for you."
good,"Great opportunities, fun, and great benefits!! I have a great manager and co-workers. I was able to finish my Bachelor's degree with Starbucks tuition reimbursement"
good,"very political within management, it's all about what you can prove when upper management comes against you, and about who you know. there's no loyalty"
good,Starbucks is a wonderful place to work. The atmosphere is fast but inviting. Rules are strictly adhered to. The people around you value those rules and strive to be better. I worked here for years and loved every (almost every) minute of it. No exaggeration! The breaks they give are awesome too.
good,"It's a great place oportunitie to work on Starbucks, you can refined you're skills and abilities to a very hight standard!it's also very fun place with a great team members!"
good,"L'ambiance, l'équipe de travail et les formations que l'entreprice nous a données."
good,"You will have fun along with learning lot of new skills. People are very friendly here and you get to work with the best minds in the industry."
good,Working at Starbucks is a very nice place. It allows you to network and learn new and transferable skills.I like what i do here it allows me to explore new flavors as well as cultures. I am also able yo learn about thee things that I am putting into my body because they provide us with a lot of knowledge.
good,i loved working at starbucks but i feel that its not a job that one can hold for too long.  it was very fun to be able to do all the things that a barista does
good,I enjoyed working with Starbucks between working with my co workers and interacting with the customers. I really enjoyed making drinks for the customer.
good,The management changed about 3 times since I got transferred over a year ago. The management gives out a favouritism to certain parties that gives her personal stuff that she will benefit from all. keeps hiring people but provides less minimum hours to those people who need hours. The company is amazing at the benefits for their employees but the management uses her power so much.
good,I loved working for Starbucks for the 5 years I was there. I had one of the best managers train me and I was and still am an awesome barista thanks to her.
good,it was a great place for people who are outgoing and friendly. I liked being able to work at a fast pace job and being able to make people happy with the smallest thing of making their drink correctly.
good,Relaxing Job with Lots of responsibility but good benefits. Easy job as long as you're willing to learn. Great company to work for with many benefits. Great part time job to have while finishing up school.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is fast paced, productive, and fun. It does not feel like a job to me because I personally enjoy working there. We have a great team of associates and we all work together very well."
good,Great work environment. Perfect job while attending college. You learn more than I ever thought possible about coffee beans. So much love goes into each drink. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the changes and off the floor work. Best part of the job  is working with amazing people and the relationships you build with your customers. They truly become family.
good,"Awesome company, and job!  Have to have extreme flexibility to schedule to business needs. Highly recommend to anyone that doesn't mind working weekends."
good,"I loved my job at the local Starbucks so much that when I lost my car and became homeless, yet still continued to be scheduled for times when bus service was unavailable, I walked just shy of 4 hours to and from work (each) for a shift that usually lasted 5 hours. When Frappuccino Happy Hour came along, my mom needed heart surgery. Despite notifying them 2 weeks in advance and trying my best to find cover for my shifts (which were required and non negotiable pretty the needs of the business), I was let go for choosing to be work my mom. The work has great and I loved what I did. But the manager was unorganized and somehow made it impossible for me to even get an interview at another location. It broke my heart, since this was the best job I'd ever had."
good,"go for it. pretty okay wages, opportunity to grow. my district had a bit of a small town buzz to it but i feel like it might be different in big cities. tips are good!"
good,Working for Starbucks was really fun and the kind of pace I needed. Learning the drinks and roles can be a little challenging because everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. You learn what you're best at and try to improve in the other areas.
good,"At this job I had a lot experience with nice customers some rude but it was okay, the manager was really sweet, it was laid back, I worked in the drive thru and in the front as a cashier, I just counted the money."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. The flexibility of the job and ability to transfer locations easily has been extremely helpful to me as a college student. Starbucks has very awesome, generous benefits as a partner, and the workplace is an upbeat place to come!"
good,"great place to work. the hard part was the schedule but otherwise I really enjoyed working there, Great benefits and management was great also. the area where I work, I used to get very good tips."
good,"Starbucks is a start off job not a career path. Even though there's many careers avalible, the pay is not worth it. The are community friendly company. They help out and volunteer when possible."
good,Starbuckss is typically a fast paced work environment depending on the time of day you are working and where you are working. The people that work there are generally a wide variety of characters and some really good friends can be made. It is super easy to connect with customers and it is fantastic. It is a great place to work while trying to get through college and the pay plus tips is typically very nice.
good,"They are great if your starting out of high school and i learned many things from working here, its been able to help me get many other jobs and they really do take care of you."
good,"I love what I do, but I'm no getting enough hours and my manager is rude and unhelpful. I love being able to connect with my regulars. The job is very fast-paced and can be stressful at times."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with customers there and the team made it seem like I was surrounded by a close family. Although it was hectic at times, I liked the environment."
good,"A nice place to work. Not for the faint of heart or the lazy. Depending on the location, the work flow can vary greatly. Almost all coworkers are great."
good,Great place to work with amazing benefits and fun activities for the staff and management. Fun and challenging place to work where I worked with people who made me a better employee.
good,"I learned how to work in a fast-paced environment and how one drink can bring a smile on someone's face.  The most enjoyable part of the job is if you love coffee like me, the smell will make you fall in love."
good,"If what Starbucks really stands for is kept to more by management then this would be the best place to work. It is fun, challenging, and fulfilling. You can really impact peoples lives for the better everyday and Starbucks will help you. A couple of their slogans are ""Make every moment right"" and ""surprise and delight"" and i really love that."
good,All my regular customers were very sweet. I miss the fast pace. The energy and rush you get when making drinks in the drive thru. You get to build relationships with customers.
good,Strong focus on inclusion and encouraging growth from within the company. Being referred to as Partners gives the employees a sense of being valued. There is a continuous focus on global growth while maintaining fair trade practices. Taking care of the farmers is a priority.
good,The hardest part of the job is staffing the store.  The best part is everything else.  Starbucks takes good care of its people.  I am a Store Manager and it's hard to promote to the next level.
good,Great place to work. Incredible sense of community with a hard-core work ethic. Super fun work environment and a perfect place to meet fellow coffee lovers.
good,I had a great experience during my time at Starbucks.  The corporate culture is unmatched.  Everyone I worked with took their job and the company's values seriously.
good,"En cuando al ambiente laboral es excelente, mucho compañerismo y valores humanos."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, good co-workers, Management was a little iffy, meaning a few of them didn't last and the last one had a lot of issues."
good,"it always kept me on my toes and it was never boring with all different types of customers. the day to day routine made it easy for me to come to work and do my job everyday with the same care and satisfaction, day after day."
good,developed a lot of experience and knowledge through my role and really helped me gain a lot of experience in many areas which is the best thing about working for starbucks.
good,"I love working for Starkbucks! Its a great company, friendly environment.  I enjoy working, and I enjoy how they treat their employees.  Its amazing!! They are real supportive of their employees!"
good,Excellent training and supportive working environment. Flexible in terms of time off. Hardest part of the job was  providing a high level of service when the service station was very busy.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work i enjoyed eveey job ive done for the cashier, barista, communicating with the customers, greeting every customer, keeping busy there was always something to do i loved it i just wished they paid a little more."
good,"A great company to work for. Environmental twas friendly for customers . "
good,"A typical day at work starts with a morning rush and making customer connections. Throughout the day we will grab merchandise, and ingredients. We send orders and work the orders from the previous week. "
good,"If you want an actual job with livable weekly hours this really isn't the place... but you get benefits even if you're only part time.  It's perfect for married people who have an additional income or people looking for a transitory deal, like college kids intending to go somewhere else etc.  I wish I worked two jobs my entire time here thus far.  Most people working there have some kind of support system scenario like family helping them out, but I'm working towards independence, so it's inadequate in ways and perfect in others"
good,Had a bad week need a pick me up starbucks is what comes to mind come enjoy your favorites from lattes to cappuccinos down to hot chocolate even snacks
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for and I would totally recommend the job to anyone who would want to apply. Unfortunately I did not have good management, thus making my store have high turn over rates."
good,It was an easy job but management made it uncomfortable and unbearable. I wouldn't have left when I did if my manager would have been nice and encouraging rather than rude and mean.
good,There are many things to get done as well as multitasking is essential. Goes beyond being on till and making drinks but must also have a friendly attitude and personality.
good,"Good place to work when I was younger, a typical day would include, serving customers, making and customizing drinks, preparing/cooking food. "
good,"Great, fun work environment. Always engaging, but never boring. Interesting retail work with a supportive team atmosphere.  Flexible hours, and reasonable pay."
good,"	Supervising and supporting staff working in the coffee shop, so as to effectively and safely discharge the company’s aim and objectives."
good,Starbucks is a great organization with a lot of potential to grow and expand your horizon. Even tho I only worked there for a bit (temporary) I had a great time.
good,"The company is great to work for, it has a lot of great benefits for its partners. They will pay for your education and provide a lot of other perks for partners."
good,"Una cultura de trabajo muy buena, uno se desarrolla muy bien en esta empresas, el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, lo que mas me gusto es el contacto con los miles de clientes que se atendían al mes."
good,"i am very passionate when it comes to work. i make drinks and connect with different kinds of people everyday. i also love to talk with people about their life, business and work."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. Focused on customer service. With a good team relationship, task oriented environment so the work load is not solely on a few partners."
good,"Overall a good company, just depends on the store you’re assigned to , Managers can be a Pain . Make things harder than they seem. But the company does offer great assets and benefits!"
good,"The typical work day at starbucks consist of walking into chaotic environment, a crowded lobby  and lots of noise. after it dies down and you finally get a moment to breath it gets more croweded"
good,"Has given me essential skills to progress in a number of different careers. Fun work environment with friendly management, staff and customers. No two days are the same."
good,I loved my time at Starbucks. Working there taught me a great deal about business and the interworking. I quickly was promoted with a pay increase and more responsibilities.
good,Starbucks has a great culture lead by the CEO. Starbucks had a lot of benefits offered to their employees. These benefits included 401K and stock options. the longer you stayed with the company to better your stock options were.
good,"great place for a first ob"
good,"Actualmente llevo 2 años y tres meses trabajando para Grupo Vips concretamente para la empresa de Starbucks. Soy barista de 24h/semanales y la verdad que mi situación laboral es inmejorable. Cuento con un ambiente de trabajo muy agradable así como buenas condiciones humanas y laborales. En estos dos años he aprendido muchísimas cosas en lo que al cliente y la venta se refiere ya que es un empleo de constante trato humano, a pesar de que algunos días no es un trabajo fácil ya que es cara al público soy bastante feliz y me siento muy realizada trabajando en esta empresa."
good,"Starbucks is a great environment to work in. It's fast paced, a bit cut-throat, and intense but it really brings people into themselves. It pushes you to move fast think sharper and smile gentler so that every customer has not just a cup of coffee but an experience they won't forget. Though it doesn't sound fun, it allows you to build up skills that will help you forever in your future endeavors."
good,"My overall experience with Starbucks is good. Their business model is effective and is something that can be taken into other opportunities, even if the industry is different."
good,"A typical day is spent brewing coffee, making drinks, keeping the store clean and tidy. I've learned a lot on how to stay organized as I work in a very high stress, busy work place. I really enjoyed the location I worked at being able to talk to new people and the regulars every day. It has really helped my communication skills grow."
good,I loved working for Starbucks and i was really good at it too. The only thing that i was very unpleased with was management in my area and it unfortunately put us understaffed and in a lot of tight predicaments. Other than that I loved it and by the time of my departure due to a move back to the states i was almost done with manager training.
good,Give and take with others partner.For me nothing is easy.Coffee maker is the best work ive do.How im so in love about the coffee.And get lot of knowledge about the coffee!
good,I only quit because I became a stay at home mom to our first born son in 2010. Never regretted it for a moment. Any person that I meet in my college classes I recommend getting a job there for the benefits and flexible hours.
good,The best place I ever worked I am a people person so it fit just great I was very interested in what people though  of coffee and how coffee was like a partner to some people. A typical day at Starbucks was very high paced and quick moving very engaging and people orientated. High energy smiles and warm hello made for a pleasant atmosphere. The potential for growth was great oh the diversity was such and add on to the atmosphere which enhanced my ability to connect with other. Everything about this job was great I have nothing  to day that can speak badly about it. I had to move o to pursue other career opportunities however I would woke there again .
good,I do not wish to participate in a review of Starbucks. There is enough publicly available information out there for job-seekers to make an informed decision.
good,Working at Star Bucks is like working with family. Communication goes a long way in running an efficient team! I would definitely recommend working here. The hours are flexible and great benefits.
good,"I had the opportunity to work with Starbucks my freshman year of college and I would say it’s agreat place for college students to work for some extra money, but not for a lifetime career."
good,"Great place, fun job.  Enjoyed working there for almost 5 years, only left due to personal reasons.  Would definitely go back if given the chance to.."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company and culture. They have full health benefits for all employees and great discounts. If it weren't for my most recent manager, low pay for supervisors, and the poor transfer policy I would still be with the company today."
good,"Starbucks is a great company and treats their employees well (aside from pay). The work is fast, prepare to feel stress, but overall is fun! I enjoy my time at work, have learned alot related to working as a team, and have made some amazing friends!"
good,This is a great job for anyone looking for something to keep them moving and on their toes. This is a fast paced job and requires a lot of teamwork with your coworkers. Your success is based on how everyone preforms as a whole and as a manger you see to where your partners are located to ensure a successful outcome.
good,"The job envornment was tough at times but is always fast pace, which makes it easier to get through the day. I think that baristas should make at least two dollars more."
good,I have worked for three different locations and all were very wonderful. each one was unique in its own way. They focused on different store strengths which helped shape my ability to adjust accordingly. Each store is very diverse.
good,"Customer service all the way.  You have to be flexible with schedules if you would like to move go.  Have to hustle all the time.  Great job, each store and district is different, unfortunate to say."
good,"excellent emploi, cependant difficile d'aller chercher plus que 12h par semaine (uniquement 3 employés sur 22 avaient plus que 20h/semaine)"
good,This company is a great company to work for.  They have awesome benefits and perks.  I greatly enjoy working for this company.  It does require dedication to work here.
good,Learning to make all the drinks and become a Barista was very fun. Interacting with guests and knowing the menu and up selling drinks or adding on a pastry always came in handy as well.
good,"Management directs workers based on think-tank job procedures. Fine for some thing but fails to allow for the CONNECT to ever occur with customers or co-workers. Strict to the minute tasks do not allow for interactions that Starbucks touts as the culture. Cluttered work spaces, dirt, trash and disorganization were everyday problems. Some co-workers so stressed that other co-worker took the brunt of the verbal abuse from them. Slow to learn workers were talked about behind their backs as being a waste of money."
good,"I worked for Starbucks Coffee as a Certified Barista at Guaynabo, PR. I found the company culture to be excellent and I also had the opportunity to learn a lot through out the years. Overall , the experience was better than I could have ever hoped for."
good,A good and easy job with fun coworkers but working at the airport if hard an stressful especially when you're inly two workers and theres 50 flights that morning.
good,"Great company.  Great benefits.  It is your standard expectation for a coffee job.  A strong dedication to the feel of the stores, uniformity of drink preparation.  Good chances for advancement."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Starbucks for the benefits and the people who would come into the café. However, I only worked with about two people that were genuinely friendly, and my boss did not care about my personal being it felt like. The associates that I worked with for the most part were not friendly nor welcoming, which was a huge disappointment, because they were the opposite of what I thought Starbucks employees were supposed to be like. Every other Starbucks that I have been to, it seems like the employees are all nice to one another."
good,"Starbucks was extremely interesting to work at. Eventhough management was not always stable, the co workers and regular guest were amazing to assist. The location that i was employed at was a part of a Target Super Center so we werent able to accept tips. But we were getting 10 dollars an hour. Like every job, theres pros which was half off food items but the con was that there were barely any hours to split between 5 people and very short shifts."

The only down side is that  it is retail so sometimes customers aren't the best but, overall they are usually nice and understanding."
good,"Learned leadership skills and teamwork. Flexible hours, high standards, fun environment, training experience, good benefits, opportunity to advance, free coffee."

good,Love the people i work with. Satisfaction given when you know that you helped out a customer or made a customer's day. Making your shifts fun and making people around you so motivated.
good,In my previous job learning new things that you can apply and share to your co-workers is one of the happiest and exciting to do like sharing knowledge to your partners or co workers and at the same time sharing it with our customers will really satisfy them.
good,"Training was excellent"
good,if you have a decent manager and partners youll enjoy your experience. you get free drinks. you meet great people. and you learn alot about coffee and making drinks
good,Working here was a blast! It was never one of those jobs where you were waiting for something to do. There was always something that needed to be done. I would HIGHLY recommend working at a local Starbucks.

good,"i enjoyed my time at starbucks but it is not for everyone. it's very quick without mistakes. i loved my coworkers and manager but the customers can be harsh, so that is something to prepare for. overall it was a fun experience"
good,Everyone got along with everyone. You get to meet your customers on a day to day basis and build that one on one connection with them on a personal level.
good,You'll have a lot of fun as a barista. I had a really great time and learned so much. The customers are fun and exciting and they make your job easy to do.

good,"I enjoyed my time working at Starbucks. The knowledge I acquired while working there definitely makes me want to return to work there in the future, My day consisted of cleaning, working drive-thru, making drinks for customers and working the cash register. The staff and customers were very easy going for the most part and I enjoyed meeting new people every day. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers whose requests were unable to be fulfilled. I feel like I have gotten harder skin from being able to deal with angry and sometimes unreasonable customers. My favorite part of the job was making drinks. I enjoyed it and loved when customers complimented my drinks.  My overall experience working there was fantastic, I left due to going away for school and wished there was a Starbucks I could have transferred to by the school."
good,"don't really have time to get to know your colleagues "
good,Customers are not always friendly and they will blame it on not having coffee but they are just awful. I enjoyed my coworkers and enjoyed how fast paced the job was. Starbucks is very good about dividing up work evenly and making the work more efficient.
good,"Working at Starbucks is more than a coffee shop. To me, it was like having a home away from home. I was able to develop a great relationship with my customers and still carry those bonds past my job today when I see them around town."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks includes meeting hundreds of new people, making an impact on hundreds of people, and learning patience and kindness for all people and situations. I learned to always give people the benefit of doubt, to hold myself to high standards and to consistently exceed those standards, to maintain a happy and safe environment, and to enrich the daily lives of my customers."
good,"Love working for Starbucks. From the upper management to the guests coming in every day, it's always a new and fun challenge. Starbucks is fast paced and very accommodating."
good,You know you are in a fun and productive work place when eight hour shifts fly by as if you only worked four hours. Great place to network and meet friendly people. Great place to work if you desire to move up in the company.
good,"I loved this job the only reason I let was because I started a new job. They required that I have one job and the pay was better. Starbucks was fun and light hearted. I wish could have kept both jobs. I have very few complaints and none about the company or how it was run. Management was understanding and very kind. the only thing there was little room for advancement, at least at the store I was working at."
good,There were many things to like. The hours were flexible and the training was hands on and great. The benefits were great as well. The only downside was the pay was not very high at my location.
good,fun great team work. diverse invironment great friendly customers and employees. organized cleanliness fast pace multi tasking involed. very professional
good,"Benefits are great. Coworkers are the best, but the customers are rude. I usually work early morning shifts around 5am-2:30. The hardest part is dealing with customers that want a specific drink made their way/"
good,A typical day at Target involves a time that is filled with plenty of opportunities for interacting with guests and for completing tasks that improve the quality of the workplace environment.
good,ive learned so many things working with starbucks. I think the best part about it is meeting new people everyday and gaining relationships with your customers.
good,"The atmosphere is great, and you develop a relationship with your other partners. You get mark outs, which are one bag of free coffee per week, and each shift you get a food item for free. The hardest part of the job is really as you are training, there are tons of drinks to remember and more patrons than that. If you stick with it, it gets better. it will always get better. <3"
good,"unique family environment, WONDERFUL CUSTOMERS, great coworkers, extreme multitasking, HIGH TURNOVER ON A WHIM. even when your manager says you're doing a great job and you are up for a promotion, she'll fire you if shes in a bad mood ;)"

good,"Out of every where that I have been employed, Starbucks has been by far the best job that I have ever had. I was able to maintain a friendly work environment and make great friends while at work.  Starbucks was amazing, and there is absolutely nothing I would change about my experience there."
good,Every day of working was extremely fun and enjoyable. Great managers who care about you and corporation standards. Also you can use get great benefits. Besides you can drink as much coffee as you can
good,A day as a Starbucks barista is definitely fast paced and exciting. You have to be able to multi-task and have a smile on the entire time you are there. It almost relies almost entirely on your customer service skills.
good,This job is fast paced. The supervisors and managers are very helpful and are very focused on accommodating to workers who really need help. They make working at this location worth it.

good,Flexibility in terms of schedule. fast-paced work environment. Clients and customers are first and great corporate culture. Employees are treated well.
good,Overall it was great working there. One of the most difficult things to do while working there was that it took a while to memorize the drinks. Everything else was pretty much self explanitory.
good,"made coffee/tea/Frappuccino's"
good,Good place very busy people are chill and pretty fun learn about coffee and customers are great get to build relationship with customers not bad at all
good,"My job as a barista is fun because i get to make over 50 different drinks daily, its also challenging because i have to remember each and every one of them. Management at my store is very strict and set to standards. The hardest part about my job is actually leaving to go home, customers bring a warm welcoming vibes that you feel very appreciated."
good,Great benefits. They even help pay for college! We are called partners instead of crew members because we are all partners in this coffee experience and always made the best out of each moment.
good,"Communicate with Manager and be liaison to Partners ensuring all standards are met. Assist in ordering, purchasing, money handling, and scheduling. Train new and current partners in functions of business."

good,Starbucks has been my dream job since forever. Having the opportunity to work at one of the locations made me realize just how much I love the Starbucks environment. Very fast paced (depending on location) and also gives the opportunity to meet new people.
good,"aprendi muita coisa, varias amizades, equipe boa.."
good,A wonderful place to work with incredible people. Great benefits such as free coffee each week and health insurance. A great environment where you can rev up your customer service skills.
good,"I took this position as part-time position to supplement my full-time job. The price you pay to afford your own place these days! What I loved about Starbucks is the people. I also love coffee and the products they sell. Employee ""Partner"" discounts and tips saved us!!"
good,"I lived on campus at San Diego State University. I currently work at one of the three Starbucks on campus. A typical day on the job is getting ready, going in, and getting greeted by all my coworkers with hugs and smiles. My workplace is awesome and I love working with all my coworkers. It gets pretty hectic most of the time, but I still love working there."
good,I really enjoyed working for Starbucks even though it was inside of a Safeway. I go to meet wonderful people and work with wonderful people each and every day.
good,"As i am required to write this review, i would like to personaly state that I have no commentary to review this location. I do not feel that it is important to have this."
good,Awesome place with family feeling everyday. i learned a lot being there 3 years. The leadership pushes you to pursue more in life outside the work place. would recommend if you are looking for flexibility.
good,I had so much fun working at Starbucks. The customers and staff are great people and I love still going to the store to get a drink. There are good work ethics behind this company which makes it nice to work with.
good,"Providing good customers services,"

good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. There are many opportunities to move within the company if you are looking to grow. It is well structured and new promotions are well executed. All the partners you can say are linked together by this company.
good,Everyday at work is something new and special. Working as a barista making the customers drink as ordered fills my day with satisfaction and joy. The manager is always showing her support and dedication to the team.
good,"Belle expérience"
good,I absolutley loved Starbucks! Customers were always our number one priority. I always went the extra mile to please and make sure that their order is correct.
good,I learned a lot of my customer service from this job. They had really good management and did an amazing job of getting all the staff together. I would highly recommend this to a student or someone in need of a part time job.

good,"One of the best companies I have worked for. Treats the employees well with so much benefits for them. It is very fast paced, never a dull moment. Always learning something new daily."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, but it absolutely depends on the store manager, if you are working at the retail level. I've had awesome store managers, and I've had managers who barely work and are terrible at their jobs. The baristas are usually awesome people and fun to work with. I've made some awesome friends working at Starbucks. Also, you get free drinks while you're working and a free pound of coffee every week and a 30% discount of merchandise. It's awesome."
good,Great job if you're an early morning person.  The busiest times are from 7 am to 10 am in which you will do 65% of your daily business.  Benefits are great for full and part time partners.
good,Great place to work.  New experiences everyday.  Great interaction with many different people.  Great place to make people smile all for a morning cup of coffee.
good,"Good client to work with and will be interested in learning new things daily. Day to day work involves tickets, requests from multiple customers.Nice company"

good,customers and employees are great and fun. time used to fly by because of rush hour and you talk to customers and other employees while working so time used to go by very fast.
good,Starbucks is an open and friendly environment. The boss and workers are very respectful. The job was pretty easy to do. And it helped that the customers were very respectful. I only worked a short time because I ended up getting pregnant and had to leave because I moved to another city that didn't have a Starbucks.

good,"Working at Starbucks is the best of both worlds. It can be high-stress at times, and in other instances it can be a lot of fun. Starbucks offers premium benefits such as competitive insurance and stock plans. There are also many opportunities to grow within the company. Although, I believe employees working in stores are underpaid."

good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. The culture is always friendly, positive, and customer focused. The benefits open to you while working for the company are great.

good,"Completing customer orders, prepping daily products and work environment, learning how to respect and anticipate all customer wants and needs. General customer service and cash handling"

good,Starbucks was face paced and fun! the team was more of a group of friends than co workers and work was a breeze when you get the hang of it! perfect side job!
good,Workplace culture is great. Management is usually good. Learn great customer service skills.The hardest part of the job is the difficulty of some customers but for the most part people are great. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build with your partners and customers.
good,"Oh how I miss the smell of coffee and fresh baked rolls at 5am. My typical morning is clocking in at 5am and setting up the café to open at 7am. I was versatile in just about everything in the store. From waiting tables, to cashier, to washing dishes, and even a little bit of throw down in the kitchen with our head chef! Workplace was always busy but never chaotic because we'd always have orders and everything else under control. In all honesty, nothing was much of a challenge here for me. The most enjoyable part of this job was I had the opportunity to work side by side with the owners and and CEO of the La Boulange owners for a day shortly before they sold the company to Starbucks :("
good,I have worked for this company over and over again.  I can get enough of the coffee.  Just great company I have ever worked for.
good,"Great coffee."
good,typicla work day was good.  i learned how to be a good retail worker.  the managment was very good.  the culture was good.  hardest part was memorizing all the drinks.  most enjoyable part was the regulars.
good,Connecting with customer and regulars daily. Very flexible schedule for any student. Friendly environment and you truly enjoy working. Great employee benefits.

good,The best company I have worked for. They take care of their employees and put a big deal into work life balance. The benefits are pretty good overall.
good,"A typical day at work would sometimes require waking up at a time where most of the world is still asleep. But that is something that is easy to get used to. I have learned so many skills that will help me thrive throughout my life, beyond my careers. I not only developed my abilities in a work-place environment, but also my social skills on how to relate, talk, and connect with people. My manager and co workers both helped me grow not only as a barista, but as an individual as well. It's rare to find a good team of coworkers that you get along with so well, but at Starbucks everyone has each others backs. You never have to feel like you're dealing with anything troublesome alone. The hardest part of the job for me came down to waking up so early. But like most things, if you do it enough times you get used to it. The best part of the job was the vast amount of connections you make with people. I met so many different people, from different parts of the world and different backgrounds, and it was simply amazing to hear their stories and to become even a small part of their life. I would have never guessed that something as minor as making a cup of coffee could go above and beyond to encourage a great day for someone,"
good,I deal with lots of different kinds of customers. I make sure I have lots of patiences with them and very respectful as well. I must try to convince customers to buy the store new products. It is a very fun job but can be very tiring at times.

good,Working at starbucks you interact with a lot of different people. You learn a lot about coffee and great recipes for drinks
good,Fast paced environment. The employees you work with make all the difference when dealing with difficult customers or stressful days. No you don't just make coffee. It's a retail industry and a food industry.
good,It usually gets very busy and have to stay on tasks. I learned to multitask while talking to customers. The hardest part was making sure to stay calm and focused.
good,"Although the fast paced environment could get overwhelming at time, the team members always tried to make work be as fun as possible"
good,A fun and relaxed place to work with an abundance of friendly co-workers and interesting customers. Best part about the job is the coffee tastings and speaking to new people everyday.
good,I honestly liked my job there. The management were supportive and the work was easy for the amount they paid. I had insurance even if I only worked PT there. They also helped with tuition.

good,"starbucks is a great place to work. it gives you an oppertunity to step out your comfort zone. it is a great atmosphere to work in. a typical day at work would depend on what time you start work. for example, if you start when the store opens, you will most likely be prepping everything from food, coffee, stoves, and the condiment bar. you would also have to restock the merchandize and bathroom."

good,"Working at starbucks no two days where the same. Making coffee and getting to meet all different kinds of people was awesome. Going into work you are either assigned to the bar, register, or the drive thru (if your store has one). Once you know your place (bar was my favorite) you start doing your work. You work in small spaces so teamwork and communication is essential."
good,"Always busy throughout the day Mon-Fri, Learned how to make drinks and go from ringing customers up on a register to making drinks, Management was poor barley worked, other coworkers were as hardworking as I was, the hardest part of the day was always the rushes, and enjoyable part was making drinks."
good,"The people you see at Starbucks that are always energetic and happy, are like that behind the scenes as well. The best part of the job was being able to meet amazing people, the ones I worked with, and the customers that came in. I learned how to be humble and kind towards other people!"

good,"Fantastic job that encourages team building and individual learning daily."
good,"My typical work schedule was only 4-4:30 hours long."

A work day goal was to make sure each & every customer was overly satisfied with their purchase &wanted to return due to our great customer connections. I learned many essential customer service skills as well as the skills required to make exceedingly awesome beverages while maintaining a customer relationship. I loved connecting with the customers, even though at times it could be challenging while we had a full store of customers."
good,"Starbucks was an amazing job to have to start somewhere. Co-workers were amazing and energetic people to work with. Although this job was very fast paced, the workers manage to find how to work together and give off the best customer satisfaction from the time they walk into the door to when they exited."

Learned to multitask as well as memorize all the different ingredients in the beverages. Learned to promote and advertise new merchandise. Hardest part of the job was standing for hours but after while you adjust to the standing. I enjoyed meeting and gaining employee to customer relationships."
good,"Fun place to work with great diversity with coworkers and management "
good,Very good store. Fast paced. The only issue is that there were too many employees and not enough work hours to go around for everyone and everyone was left with small amounts of hours.
good,"Starbucks is always very busy, so there is always something to do. I feel that working at Starbucks has helped my memory. Most of the drinks and how to make them are memorized. The hardest part of the job is the cleaning at the end of the night. There is so much to clean and take apart."
good,everyday was a new adventure being able to brighten peoples day with a  simple hello or being able to remember a regular or not so regular customers order to make the experience mean that much more.
good,It was a great first job. I learned a lot about customer service and how to stay calm under pressure. I always had great coworkers and managers. The worst part about the job besides the pay is difficult customers.
good,Environment involves team work in a fast-paced environment with many distractions and sometimes harsh environmental conditions. Company provides excellent support for employees wishing to transfer or needing leaves of absence.
good,working at Starbucks was a lifetime opportunity. Being able to make a customer's day was one of the best parts of the day-to-day things we accomplished.
good,"Their benefits can't be beat, as well as extra perks like free products and great insurance. better than any other retail job out there."

good,"Despite the low wages Starbucks treats employees with respect and the stores are filled with fun, interesting people."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is welcoming the regular customers, getting everything in order to get the rush continuously moving and customers in and out satisfied. The job duties are register, restock, mop/sweep, sanitize dishes, prepare coffees and teas."
good,"I started at Starbucks as a high school senior needing to make money before college, but I quickly found that this was much more than just a job. My partners make every day at work fun, cracking jokes and having a good time in a fast paced environment. I've learned how to work as part of a team, and how important my position is to making the store function as a whole. Nearing 5 years with the company, I can honestly say it has been the greatest experience and I could never have imagined starting my life in the work force in any other environment."
good,"I learned to work effectively as a part of a team in a high-stress, results-oriented environment. My co-workers essentially became my second family away from home. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unsatisfied customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was making those unsatisfied customers happy by giving them the starbucks experience."
good,"I've taken many skills away from this position and will always be grateful the opportunity that was given. The more the upper management requires the store level to work understaffed with the same level of efficiency, the more store level morale dips and good, hard working baristas are seeking employment else where.  Really an unnecessary trend for the company.  If upper management chose to teach those who are guilty of labor waste, with those who manage labor successfully year round, then scrambling during a 4th quarter crunch would not be necessary. I would stay if the labor crunch was lifted."
good,"Very busy no matter what day. You grow as a team as well as individually. It was a family-like experience. Customer service proved to be the most challenging at times, but it helps you grow."
good,"Starbucks has so many benefits and opportunities to grow. The management and co-workers feel like family, which is the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some difficult customers, but Starbucks wants employees to cater to the customer to make them as happy as they can, which makes the barista's life a lot easier."
good,Depending on location is how the stress level may be. Higher performing locations may become more stressful and demand more efficient work. Lower performing locations are more laid back but allow for fewer labor hours with less workers on the floor at each time of day.
good,"The company overall has a great culture and many opportunities for advancement, but in my locality, there is few opportunities and compensation for a dedicated employee is subpar."
good,"I learned a lot from working for Starbucks. It accustomed me to a great deal of responsibility as I was a shift supervisor. Fast paced, energetic environment that encouraged customer connections and a positive outlook on life. Great standards, great expectations and a high level of leadership skills. Granted me the ability to take initiative, delegate properly."
good,"This company walks the talk and give their employees a lot of benefits like vacation, health insurance, 401K all for part-time workers."
good,"A fast-paced work environment catering mostly to Creighton University students. Great coworkers, flexible, and I am proud to be a Starbucks partner."
good,"Though one was expected to be professional, organized, and efficient in one's tasks, the workplace was constantly filled with good humor and pleasant conversation between coworkers and customers alike."
good,I have nothing negative to say about Starbucks. The benefits and the care we receive is unbeatable. The store feels like a family. Like a family there can be drama but it all gets worked out professionally.

good,"I enjoyed working for this company. You'll learn alot about people based on the drink that they ordered. The environment is always laid back and relaxing. Where it would motivate the employee to want to come to work. Not too often do you work somewhere, where you want to come to work."
good,you always have to be multi tasking by cash handling and making espresso drinks. always have to have your area clean and your dishes.
good,The people I worked with at starbucks were amazing. They always helped me in learning the recipes of each drink. Overall an amazing time was spent at starbucks.
good,"A typical days work involves commuters. I am a very up beat person, even when starting at 4.45 am, and my aim for a morning shift is to be both efficient and friendly to help them start their day well. As part of the management team I have to make sure orders have been placed, stock takes are completed and end of week (including looking at GP, wage bugets and the P & L) are all completed. I am also fitting in after work studying my NVQ Level 3 in Business Management."

A typical work day I would greet hundreds of customers with a cheerful hello and a smile.  I would prepare a beverage of their choice and make it to their specification.  My co-workers were amazing.  They were always there to lend a helping hand when needed and made working there so much fun.  I would say this job was a pretty easy job.  For some, they might say the hardest part of this job is learning to make all the different beverages and being quick and accurate with it.  For me though, the hardest part was learning all of my customers names and their ""go-to"" drinks.  Even though it wasn't required, it made the customer feel special and in return would give us repeat business."
good,"Great company that takes care of its employee. Busy environment, full of diversity and fun people. Great place to start your career."
good,"There were some bumps in the road along the way, but overall Starbucks was my favorite job I've ever had.

As a supervisor, I also was in charge of cash handling, running breaks, and coming up with creative solutions to problems and road blocks on the floor. I learned a great deal of patience and social skills with this job, and every day was different. My co-workers were very hard working. At Starbucks, we're known as partners and not employees. We're a team, and during rushes when customer tempers flared up and my co-workers got overwhelmed this simple word made more sense than ever. We we're supportive of each other and communication between us was crucial. The hardest part of working at Starbucks was having to interact with people before their coffee fix, and dealing with problems that would arise.

good,"Starbucks has been a great company to work for. I have gained a lot of good experience through interactions with customers, and my fellow partners. Management has always been fair and cooperative with schedules and hours. I can always pick up extra shifts if I need to, since there are so many locations within a few miles of each other. Standing up all day, and dealing with the large number of orders at peak times can be difficult, but overall this is a company that gives back to their partners."
good,"FUN job, great job for learning multitasking skills, staying on your feet. The atmosphere is very energetic and high pace, great people, challenging but very fun."

Most co-workers are great, but there are a few that make a shift long and boring. Not really a difficult job. Most enjoyable part of the job is creating relationships with customers and partners."
good,"well, as for working for Starbucks for over five years it has been quite tough for me, what makes it so tough is the people that work for Starbucks. I have wanted to step up on the leader and never received an opportunity to do so. which makes me feel sad about not being promoted, I have asked the manager what can I do to grow with the company and never received a response. I have had my personal business put out through the whole store by the manager when it was suppose to be kept confidential. but besides the people the company itself is a great company due to hard times they help you, and you receive benefits, stocks and paid vacation which is amazing."
good,"Its a fun place to work. You learn a lot about coffee that most people don't know about. It is a fast pace environment, but making the beverages, working with your partners and talking to people make it fun."
good,Fun place to work but can get messy at times when it comes down to cleaning. the benefits of working at Starbucks were pretty phenomenal. There is always something to do at Starbucks
good,The job is overall a great experience. It can get crazy busy and stressful sometimes. The hours work with you lifestyle and getting days off is really easy.
good,"Good place to work, good perks, but it is a high stress environment with a high turnover rate at many of the stores. Although Starbucks promotes itself as a business where you can move up quickly if you really want to, it can actually be quite hard especially with the cliques that can form within the different districts."

It made me a more motivated individual and through that I could better accomplish the company mission. The hardest part of the job was the long hours of standing.

I learned how to serve many different types of personalities within customer service, as well as working with many different types of people because it is very diverse. Management is always approachable and friendly. The hardest part, for me, was keeping a work schedule that accommodated to my school schedule. The most enjoyable part was always enjoying my shift and having an upbeat vibe throughout the store."
good,"I love working for Starbucks! The perks and the health benefits are great! I wish I could have stayed, but I was offered a full time, higher paying job, so I had to quit, but I loved my time there!"

good,"Starbucks is where I first started in the working world. I worked there for over 3 years and it was the best time of my life. It wasn't always easy but the customers made it worth it. In the time I was with the company I worked at 3 different stores full-time and was able to gain great new experiences. The teams I worked with were amazing and easy to work with. My managers have always been great and have goals set that were exciting to meet. It's a job that will always push you to go further and further in the company. The hardest part of the job was the training and learning all the different kinds of drinks. But that's also the best part of the job, once you know how to make it all you can explore and create new drinks and be original. The most enjoyable part of the job was the partners I worked with and the friendships I got out of it, as well as the customers who learn to know you by name and really care about you."
good,"I typically open the store with a shift supervisor. Once we get in the door I clock in and head straight to the pastry case , barista's usually do the pastry case. A pastry case is a food case that we sat in front of the store so fresh pastries are to be sold to each and every customer.  Throughout my shift I'm on register asking for customers names , I make handcrafted beverages for customers, and make Starbucks a well known business with providing customers the knowledge of Starbucks culture. I have learned so much from Starbucks, but the most valuable asset to learning at  Starbucks is everybody is different co-workers, customers, management etc. Starbucks doesn't have one set race or ethicity that comes to the business, its not for rich or poor , it's because they are coming to get their very own personal handcrafted beverage. Management is great, they are very busy with the store. But they are also very organized with their partners to making sure they are in a right place. Co-workers begin to grow as your family, you develop a relationship with team effort, everybody has eachothers backs."

good,You'll come to a point wherein you will go to work because of the partners and customers as well. I learned to kill the customers and the rude customers all with kindness. The store is being managed by a very responsible and cool store manager. The hardest part is when its Christmas season but you will get to enjoy the time because of the partners.
good,"I have to say that after working at Starbucks for over a year I still really enjoy it. I was hired as full time and given full time hours all the time. Booking vacation time off was never an issue as long as I give plenty of notice, I had to cut my availability back to only two days a week and they were totally accommodating. I miss not being there more often. My fellow partners are amazing, they whole atmosphere pushes teamwork and cooperation, I really enjoy it--plus, free coffee!"
good,"Starbucks is my very first job. It is good experience and it is very good way to meet different people. However, it is not for everyone."

good,"A typical day at work includes brewing coffee, handcrafting drinks, and providing a positive energy to the customers. I have learned a lot about time management and how to provide better customer support. The management at Starbucks is some of the best I have worked for. They are very knowledgeable and helpful, whether it is job related or personal issues. Along with the management, my co-workers are just as hardworking. There isn't a person that I don't want to work with, or haven't learned something from. I believe the hardest part of this job might be the difficult customers, but with the right attitude, any situation can be handled in a professional manner. And as for the most enjoyable part of my job here at Starbucks, I love interracting with the customers and handcrafting the drinks."
good,"Be prepared to work hard and multitask, this will all payoff because you will establish an amazing work ethic that one can apply anywhere else. Managers are willing to work around your schedule so it's great for students, plus part time and full time employees get benefits."
good,"Wonderful environment with highly supportive and understanding scheduling for students and parents, along with a fantastic benefits program and a great opportunity for growth in leadership."

good,Starbucks has lead the industry in caring for their employees.
good,"Either opened or closed the store depending on my class schedule. From the time the doors were open till they closed the line would constantly be filled with students/ faculty of Cal State Fullerton. At times my co-workers and myself were making close to 100 drinks an hour. I learned the process required each morning to have the store ready and prepared for the thousands of students expecting their coffee throughout the day. I also became very knowledgeable of how the store was to be closed properly, so that it was ready and prepped for those opening the next day. When I first began working, there was only one store location and manager, they were a picture perfect manager. Knowing where to place each employee in the line of rotation, making sure breaks and lunches were always going out. They knew the busy times of day and the times in which the employees could focus on preparing for the next rush. My co-workers were always helping each other out, covering shifts if someone was unable to show up, as well as knowing their place and position among the rotation around the bar. The hardest part of the job was keeping a constant pace for each new customer that walked into our store, because we knew they were on a time schedule and could not afford to be late. The most enjoyable part of the job was working the hot bar, being able to make hot drink after hot drink, calling out the owner of that cup and seeing the look of appreciation on their face. I also enjoyed seeing the customers that would come every day, and knowing their drink of preference."
good,"Great starter job  with  good benefits, and lots of opportunities to advance"

good,"I loved working for Starbucks and coming in every morning. Waking up at dawn, grinding fresh coffee and putting pastries out. I have gained most of my people skills at this job. I loved seeing the regulars and not having to ask what they wanted because I already knew when I saw them step into the line. The management was also friendly and was a blast to work with. The co-wokers was also a great time to work with. The hardest part was at the beginning trying to remember all of the recipes for all of the different drinks we had. After awhile and a thousand customers later you get a hang of it. The most enjoyable part was just seeing everyone. I worked at the one on my campus so I saw a lot of my friends and gained a lot of friends also. Overall, The job is a great way to meet new people and get a kick in your morning routine."

I love all of my managers and also my different co workers that left and the new ones that came. The hardest part of the job was to have the patience with rude people that came in the early mornings, the most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere and the energy people cam win with and from of course my co workers."
good,This job was very enjoyable for me. The fast paced environment was a great experience and taught me how to work quickly.
good,Beaucoup d'indépendance mais aussi un soutien professionnel qui permet d'en faire un très bon lieu de stage.
good,The company is willingly to develop their employees as much and as far that employee wants to go.
good,"A typical Day at work would be to set-up, make drinks, and interact with guests. I learned how to interact with various people, new skills, and information about the company and products. The management was ok but lacked a sound structure. Most of the co-workers got along. The hardest part of the job was sometimes running out of product to make drinks. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the regular customers."
good,"I worked as part-time job in Starbucks for over 1 year."
good,"A typical day of work can go by fast if very busy."

good,"This job experience gave me not only skills like accurate planning, setting and delivering daily and monthly KPIs, analysing sales reports and P&L, daily managing of staff, team-building and motivating, assesing staff performance, but also a sense of belonging to the company as a family and loads of friends. I genuinely enjoyed working with bunch of people with great passion for what they do and are willing to walk the extra mile to give customers a homely feel.

The management was always fantastic at my store, and he did his best to work with any scheduling conflicts that may arise.  My co-workers were fantastic and ultimately I was sad that I relocated and had to leave this job."
good,"Excellent experience, loved learning new things and meeting new people."
good,"I started off as a Barista, and moved up to an Assistant Manager. I basically co managed with the head Manager. Day to day, look over employees and guide them. Provide a safe but fun and energetic environment for customers and employees. Assisted my manager with hiring new employees, everyday orders, scheduling, etc. I learned that management somewhat has to be a role model to the employees to benefit everyone. The hardest part of the job was confronting employees if they did something they were not supposed to, I learned to stay calm and talk with them instead of down at them. My most enjoyable part of this job was the fast paced environment and working as a team with my employees. The best reward is seeing a customer smile as they leave and come back the next day."
good,Nice company could offer more service to its employees. Even if we are part time.
good,Through a typical day at Starbucks you are interacting with returning or new customers. As a barista it is your job to make the customer feel welcome and acknowledge their needs. The management and staff at this location are very professional and positive.

The most enjoyable part of this position is being able to make the customer happy and have them leave highly satisfied.

good,"My shift started from 0700 to 1400 from Monday through Friday, I would check in with the Security Officer on shift to relieve them from their duty to start my shift. I would perform numerous foot patrols through out the building to insure safety along with vehicle patrols to insure safety outside of the building. Through my 3 months of working at the Starbucks HQ got me familiar with high professional integrity and learning about the company about how it began as a small coffee store to Howard Schultz owning over 48,000 stores. I have worked with some of the most professional, goal oriented people. I got the privilege to work where Starbucks started out. I would say the most challenging part about working at the Starbucks HQ was that it was a very attractive place for tourists and it would become difficult to know where the tourists were going because the building has 10 floors and only 2 of the 10 are for employees (partners) only."
good,I enjoyed working here always fun and fast paced while still a friendly nice and calm environment always smiley faces and always someone willing to help

good,All the time Starbucks is lunching new promotion and as a employee my duty is to share my experience about this new promotion with costumer and it is the most interesting part of this job. When I 1st started to work up there i find it bit hard. But later on i find this as easy to do work and for this i like to thank my colleagues who gives me all time support and encourage to be efficient.

good,rescato mucho de este trabajo que cada  cliente que entra a tienda es mas que eso se convierte en un amigo a quien le creamos momentos de inspiración en la vida diaria de cada uno de ellos.
good,"My usual day at work is pretty fun and always learning new things. When I come in there is always something to keep me busy which I love, whether it be making drinks or cleaning something it keeps me productive. Most of the time I work there I am by myself. I have learned to be a team player as well as independent by working the Starbucks by myself. Overall my management is great and we see eye to eye most of the time. However some of my co-workers will slack off and not get their daily jobs done which puts more pressure on me when I come in after them because that means I have to get their work done as well as mine in a timely manner. It has made me develop more in knowing what im capable of in doing above and beyond what I am asked of. The hardest part of the job is sometimes when I am by myself and we get busy and I have to take all the orders and make all the drinks in time to satisfy the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is my loyal customers who come in just because they know I wont let them down in knowing exactly what they want and making it perfectly every time."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a fun, comfortable, high energy, high pace environment. I enjoyed coming to work and seeing happy faces of my customers and making there day with a simple cup of coffee.

The hardest part of the job is physical activity all day long since we started our shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the clients were living the store very satisfied with our service and when they used to come over  and over again,appreciate our hard work and enjoy themselves at Starbucks."
good,"One of the best most fun, college jobs I could have chosen. Their benefits and discounts are rewarding as well."
good,"My typical day consists of making coffee and dealing with money.  I do a daily deposit from the sales of the day prior.  I've learned do handle various types of people and I know how to handle different stress filled situations.  Management could use some changes, mainly because of the lack of actual management presence.  My co-workers are great just on the immature side of life. The hardest part of the job is handling the morning coffee rush, but after 7 years you get use to it.  I've been with the company for so long that there really is not a hard part, just reminding myself that its just coffee.  I do love the fact that insurance is provided and that stock options are accessible to us, even the part-time partners. I love the weekly coffee mark-outs that we receive (1lb of coffee a week)."

This is what I enjoyed the most about working for Starbucks; the positive work environment."

Starbucks has an outstanding about of customers everyday and it is of utmost importance to provide high customer service at a fast pace.

It was a healthy balance which was important to the manager who was friendly and approachable. In the beginning it was stressful trying to remember all the different drinks but after you mastered a latte it all just clicked. I am so sad I had to leave and would absolutely work at Starbucks again.

I had a lot of running around to do of course, but there wasn't a place that I needed to be without either a fun, funny or questionable customer, or one of my co workers right behind me. I learned a few things working for Starbucks. I learned the beauty of teamwork. Working together with my team made it possible for the things we needed to get done easier, customers to be happier and clean up to be a breeze! I had the most amazing management team EVER! My GM was really laid back but always kept us exactly where we needed to be, my AGM was really cool but nobody wanted to mess with him or mess up when he was around, my shift supervisors treated me like I was one of them as in they never made me feel less than anything. I was trained to be a professional at what I was doing. My co-workers were amazing. We all laughed, joked and made each other feel like family everyday at work. The hardest part of my job was getting around to EVERYTHING and getting them done before the time it was suppose to be finished. If the time is 9:50 and my coffee was suppose to be brewed at 10:05, I would have to get the tables cleaned, milk out, stations filled, bathrooms checked, milk containers cleaned, cups restocked, syrups brought out for my team members making coffee, straws put out, restock milk for my team members, most likely get stopped by one of my customers, change garbage and then get to my coffee on time. Even though I did that and more, that was the most challenging part of my job. The most enjoyable part"

There's a mutual understanding that we may be great right now, but we always ask how we can be even greater, for ourselves, for each other, for the company, and for the world. "

good,"Starbuck's Billiards was a poolhall in downtown Pensacola. I'd typically come in at 8pm and stay until roughly 3am. In between those hours I'd keep a watchful eye, stop any problems that may arise, do a little routine maintence, clean, stock the cooler, and other little jobs. The owners were excellent managers. They were very willing to help me anyway possible (schedule change, loans, etc.). I got along with most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job (which was my favorite part) is knowing that you are responsible for everyone else's saftey and well being."

good,"A day of work consists of customer service. My goal is to have customers leave happy because of the service I provide. I am very team oriented and the store helps me use leadership skills. hardest part of the job is not enough hours, I would like to work more but there are a lot of people. I like that I can leave without taking any work home with me. Co-workers are good if we work as a team."
good,"A typical day at work would be making/serving customers drinks, making sure everything is clean and organized and that the customer leaves happy. I learned a lot working here, its definitely not just about coffee here, it's way more than that. There are always new drinks or food coming out, you need to be able to describe coffee it's taste what food to pair it with. You learn how to deal with difficult situations and its just a fun place to work. Like every job it has it's days, for example a difficult customer but then you have your co-workers who make everything much better, at least where I work everyone is great. Most enjoyable part of the job has to be learning new drinks trying them out, or when you hand a drink to the customer and they let you know how much they loved it, it's definitely a great feeling."

good,I love working at Starbucks. I loved being able to make coffee for people even though sometimes it would get pretty crazy. When I would have a line up of like 10 coffees and people were still ordering.. but I loved the hustle and bustle like that. If its too slow I lose interest too quickly. The only thing I can say that I didnt appreciate was the fact that people got quite picky about their drinks they wouldnt tell me that they wanted their drink a certain way until after it was made so they thought they could keep the other drink even though it wasn't made to the proper specifications. But I loved making drinks and if it was slow we were able to try out different recipes to see if it came out good and if it did we were able to suggest it to the customers as samples. it was a great place to work.
good,Enjoyed meeting and greeting regular customers and creating unique drinks to suit their needs.

I've been trying to transfer to a different store but there haven't been any openings at other stores, so I decided to find a change in employment."
good,"The company takes care of its employees, offering healthcare and stock options. Scheduling will be based on how your manager handles it. From my experience, it was flexible enough to accommodate school."
good,"Best place to work! Pay is good, benefits are great, coworkers are always fun and easy to work with. "
good,I was constantly challenged with the fast pace of the job and the changing expectations day-to-day. I most enjoyed being able to network with different people and expand my network as well as be pushed to my limit to remember facts and prioritize my tasks in need of importance. I was able to cultivate my multi-tasking abilities and my ability to make quick and strong connections with people. The hardest part of the job ended up being the lack of upward mobility within the company as well as the strenuous labor of the position and the career level. 
good,Starbucks taught me a lot about hard work and customer service and I will forever value the years I worked for the company.

We have become a very tight-knit family pushing each other to grow and improve our skills in life and business. I learned basic marketing, sales, and promotional skills through training and meetings. I grew as a leader when I took on the role as retail supervisor. It challenged me to not only hold myself accountable, but my team accountable for their performance, attitude, and success on the floor."
good,From 7am-4pm would be my shift. From 7-11 there would be non stop rush with lots of business.

The hardest part of our jobs is keeping us with our hourly rushes. The most enjoyable part of our job is the loyalty of our customers who come back everyday, several times a day."
good,"I loved the job. It was detailed in depth and fast-paced. I actually felt like I was apart of a team and not one person having credit for everything. The manger tried her best to manage us, but at the end of the day, there was always room for improvement. The hardest part of the job was the conglict between partners and the sress of making sure every customer enjoys their beverage. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I never not once doubted me being there. I loved going in every morning and looked forward to working."
good,The Starbucks mission is to inspire and cultivate knowledge.

I learned about the roasting process and how careful the Starbucks Products were handled while being shipped across the United States. My co-workers and I would work very well as a team in placing Starbucks Products into designated boxes and placing them neatly organized onto pallets to be loaded into the trailers.

good,"Starbucks is a great first job. The people you work with ""partners"" really become a family once the years go by. However, new management can greatly affect the experience.

good,The job is good. If you are looking for a part-time job that pays pretty well and where the company looks out for your best interest this is it. The offer you benefits and vacation hours even if you are part-time.
good,Starbucks truly cares about the continual development of their employees and are very flexible with work schedules.
good,"A typical day at work was fun and exhausting at the same time. Working for this company taught me real patience. Upper management was not supportive to the needs, ideas, or feelings of the partners. I didnt like all of my co-workers the same but they were a nice group of people. The hardest part of the job was being belittled, lied to and strung along by mangement. The most enjoyable part of my job was to know that when my fellow patrners and customers saw me at work that they had no worries about it being a great shift/day or there drink being made right or about being greeted with a warm smile and having a great day."
good,"Arguably, one of the best places to be employed at. Great benefits, unique culture and you make tips!"
good,Starbucks Corporation is a very beneficial team environment providing daily learning experiences in customer service.
good,"Best place I have ever worked for, It was a good environment. Great people to work with and always kept busy but fun at the same time."
good,• Implemented employee appreciation campaign for the store.
good,"would love to work there again! great place to work, full time benefits, great atmosphere, perks, and steady flow of tasks and customers"
good,"I worked at Starbucks for about 4 years and aside from the questionable management, I truly enjoyed my experience there. It really helped me gain the tools I need to become a successful bartender/cocktail waitress."
good,I loved working there and meeting new people. Management in the city is not as good as it is in queens. Would recommend working there if you like a busy enviorment
good,I loved working at Starbucks and the company. But I had to leave because the management was really toxic. My regular customers always made my day. I still work at a Starbucks but not the same one.
good,"Long lasting option if you commit to connecting with the staff and keep up with seasonal drinks.Teamwork , mastering your craft and listening is essential. Making sure you pay attention to Starbucks personal goals such as making the experience feel personal for each customer is important. Take Pride in being part of the Starbucks family and you'll fit right in ! Enjoyed my overall time."
good,"A good place to work and develop."
good,Poor management and great company and benefits. Hard fo move up and be promoted and hard work goes unnoticed. Fun environment and great school program if you maintain good grades.
good,"They have their issues.  Being a Veteran, I was excited to have been offered a chance to enter their Management training program.  They boasted a work life balance, of no more than 50 hours in your store, and that is nearly impossible in todays culture, where missing work is ok with some. You are expected to be a barista, while managing as well.  You are given roughly 12 hours of administrative time for your managerial duties, and expected to be a barista the rest of the time.  Pay was not in line with the amount of work, and bonuses were horrible being they were only quarterly. "
good,Works at Starbucks is suitable for a person who is capable in handling stress at one time. Sometimes you are going to come face to face with customer that has an attitude. Sometimes you are very happy with what you do at Starbucks
good,"Loved this job! Great first time job, great atmosphere! You start to feel like a family! Loved the fast pace and excitement on customers face when they received their handcrafted beverage! Will always be a job I look forward to returning to."
good,"You’re gonna be face with a lot of snobs, aggressive and mean people working at startbucks; I think there’s something in the coffee that makes them so edgy all the time. However, the partners always help lighten the mood and make the workplace fun, knowing how to make fancy beverages are fun too, you feel like a professional when you are well trained and know what to do."
good,"Honestly I love my job and the people I work with. HOWEVER, I feel like the start pay should be different especially for those of us who have family to support. $9/hourly to start isn’t a huge check. I don’t expect $13+ and hour, but I mean I could make $13+ and hour somewhere else and not have the flexibility or understanding like Starbucks offers."
good,"The best job I ever had, staff and management are extremely friendly, always have your your best interest, like one big family, very fast paced but the day goes in fast"
good,I have an ok experience with my customers and co workers. Some of them are harder workers than others. Some dont do their jobs and makes that one person who does everything a little for irritated. Customers are very respectful.
good,A great place to work as a first job. Great company culture and benefits. Difficult to advance with no clear path to advancement. Management will make or break your experience as an employee for Starbucks. Definitely a fast paced and fun job.
good,"I understand corporate never wanting a manager to feel stagnant where they work, but every quarter a new SM is moved to a new store. Leaving a lot undone for especially small stores (mallbux)"
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. It is a demanding work environment that hones ones strengths and sharpens weaknesses. There are never ending learning experiences and superiors encourage advancement in the company.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks as I am a fast paced worker. It is somewhere I would work again as I like fast paced work places. I learned that there are different kinds of people in customers. The hardest part of my job was having an off customer, trying to relate to their problem and be the best I could to fix their problem. The most enjoyable part of the job was having customers leave with a smile."
good,"Alot of hardwork , fast , and hands on . Tired days , long days , a lot of smiling and connecting with customers. Remembering named and customers is key ."
good,"The number one goal is serving the customers, but depending on staffing, it's hard to focus on that goal and hit all the other goals. When a team has a supportive and tuned in manager, it usually goes well. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know customers and create awesome relationships. I have loved every barista team that I have worked with. So many of them are amazing, creative, and strong."
good,Overall the job was great but the work environment was horrible the managers was very rude didn’t help with anything but the customers were so lovely I worked at a college campus so pretty much the same customers the customers were the best part
good,Working as a student at a University directed Starbucks is a nightmare. We are constantly understaffed with upper management refusing to give more hours necessary to be as successful as we could be. I gave hours I could work and included days I couldn't work and was put on the schedule for those days anyway. Needless to say I didn't show because I had class and they understood. Took about a month for this issue to be resolved.
good,I felt like every employee was like family. The managers were very educated and respectful. They always asked how I was and if I needed any help with anything at work. Frequently came together to support one another especially during times of distress.
good,I love working at starbucks it is an easy job cleaning and up keeping. Money is ok but there are no benefits so if you are looking for a career it is not that kind of job.
good,Really fast past and can be difficult if you get overwhelmed easily in a busy environment like the airport! But i enjoy working there especially with my coworkers and management.
good,Starbucks has a great culture and work experience. Be wary that like most fast food places there are always some bad apples. However Starbucks does a really good job with addressing any problems as well as relocating if possible. It also one of the few companies I know of that have options to move up to management level internally. Awesome company overall and would recommend to anyone.
good,"Worked for the company from 2013-2016. Shift leads like myself made the same pay rate as regular baristas. It didn’t matter that/if you were certified or not. The company also has a poor way of handling tips. Instead of it being only the shift working that day, it was spread across the whole team working that week. People who didn’t even work except 1 day a week made as much in tips as those of us who put in 40 hours..."
good,"I worked at good store, I just needed something less hectic. I loved my boss, the employees, and the atmosphere but soon it becomes redundant and unstimulating."
good,"I enjoy my time working for Starbucks, I wish they gave more options for working mothers and full time college students. The management was not always available when needed and never responded to concerns"
good,"A bit overrated, I would have to say. The girls who urged me to apply for this position talked about the workplace being insanely fun & exciting, filled with nothing but good days, easy work, great pay, lenient mamagement, etc. The actual job was much more difficult than anticipated, I was totally unprepared for what was expected of me. The interview I had initially failed to mention basically everything that I would need to know, I was thrown a giant binder full of recipes for eveey Starbucks drink ever made in history & told to memorize it. Management was awful, I personally had a horrible experience with my manager. You could say she threw me to the wolves my first day. I had to learn everything on my own, save what ONE of my coworkers, who rarely was on the schedule with me, managed to half-heartedly explain to me. Definitely a big disappointment as far as I'm concerned, I would have expected much more from such a prestigious company."
good,I loved my co workers and I loved the job . Even on the bad days something good came out of it . Hours could’ve been better and security could’ve been better but overall it was a nice place to work
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working side by side with like minded people who just want to make someone’s day. And meeting new people who become apart of your everyday routine.
good,"Great place to work if you like fast-paced days. Customers were really nice and friendly. Once I learned to create drinks, it was pretty routine. I opened and worked mostly mornings."
good,Working at Starbucks was an incredibly rewarding experience. I was able to assist in the launching of a brand new store where I learned a lot of valuable skills that I have used later in my career. If not for the low pay I likely would have worked for the company as long as they would let me!
good,"Great company to work for. Plenty of room to learn and grow. Great partner benefits and LOTS of free coffee and food. Always moving, rarely a dull moment. Can be very stressful and hard on your body."
good,I work at a licensed starbucks so our store is run a bit differently then most corporate stores. The customers are great most times too. The only thing i dislike is the way our manager runs our store. There is no consistency and family members of the manager are in high positions so a lot of things aren't fairly disputed or dispersed.
good,The managers worked with my school and 2nd job schedule. Though I had a lot of experience I was never able to move up. Just to continued getting work.
good,"Give us your opinion about"
good,It was fun working with SB philippines. They're good and kind. The company always making sure that the baristas always giving a legendary customer service. 😊
good,"It was a good job for me while attending college. Depending on which location you work at experiences can vary. From my experience, it is a good place to meet different types of people."
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for. The benefits that are provided are very worth it but the pay is still not enough to get by on your own. Corporate is amazing with new and exciting work place changes, but management is lacking and there’s a bad problem with playing favorites at this location within the management. Apply at any other Starbucks for the amazing experience you won’t have at this location."
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers; they were all very nice people.  The managers often disregarded my class schedule and gave me far more hours than I requested.
good,Worked at a Franchise. Great place to work at in college! Never felt overwhelming. Would love to go back for just the weekends. People were young and hip.
good,"Overall experience I'd say is great but, it is time for me to move  onto a lasting career. I would have to say the stress of trying to work as fast as I could was getting to me a bit. But I'd still recommend working there because the atmosphere is so welcoming and the drinks are the best part of the job."
good,"fun workplace, great people, best part of the job is the connections you make and all the different drinks you learn how to make. flexible hours, really good job for students."
good,I love working for Starbucks but I have had four different managers and only one was an actual manager and I started at $7.25 and i have been there for four years and now i make $9.25 an hour. The benefits and discounts are amazing but not enough to stay.
good,Not enough hours and not payed enough per hour . The managers differ from good to bad and depending on the people you work with the shift can go completely wrong .
good,For the most part Starbucks is a good job it was just the simple fact of not being able to progress and develop As a barista.  But it is  fast pace and constantly keeps you busy  Which is good for those who get bored easy.
good,"Avantages sociaux est un plus chez Starbucks, qualité de travail exemplaire"
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks and if the money were worth the effort I would have stayed. The manager I worked under ran her store phenomenally and I can honestly say I wouldn't want to have worked under another manager. I am proud to say my store was the cleanest in my district!
good,"make spesific coffee"
good,Fast paced work days. You'll always be doing something and moving around. Hours vary. If you have open availability this is the job for you. You'll get the most hours and tips. Tips are spilt after each week. Find an average hourly rate and you get that amount to the hours you've worked.
good,"Good job but I personally had terrible management, the pay was good and the job was quite easy. I like the customers but didn't appreciate how I was treated when I tried to call in and no coverage was available, they made me work while sick."
good,Starbucks is a good company to work for they just don’t pay their employees enough money to live comfortably. Having a small child I live paycheck to paycheck.
good,i always loved going to work my team my customers every holiday was always a joy and great experience. new drinks new food . never a dual moment within the company
good,loved seeing more & more customers each day come to me saying i’m their favorite barista or they point me out telling me they want me making their drink! It makes my day knowing I can put nothing but a smile on my Guest faces!
good,It is a supportive environment that works with my single mom schedule it has so many benefits. It has also been great at teaching me life skills for example everyone new partner gets stocks. Also have training every month on how to treat customers with respect and understanding.
good,I really enjoyed my time there people i worked with really help me to grow further in the company and make me strong. Also i liked how they took good care of there employers.
good,"Working at Starbucks has been the most challenging, yet the most rewarding experience. A day at work involves learning something new, providing a safe and happy environment, and overall a great time. 1 amazing thing I've learned is multi-tasking. dealing with a lot of pressure is a sure given for the job but, really worth it."
good,"Starbucks saved my life. Perhaps this statement is a little dramatic, but I did not know what I wanted to do with my life until I became a barista. It is the most satisfying job I have ever had."
good,I was at starbucks for 9 months and I enjoyed it half way through my time there. I moved up to San Jose for school so it was a bit hard to be away from family. In the beginning my boss was understanding but over time it hindered me. Management changed over time and it seemed lke there was a lack of support for partners
good,"I like working at Starbucks, I wish I could go back but I can’t bcuz I have a baby and I also breastfeed... they pay really good at the airport..moveu"
good,"It is very fast paced in the mornings, but in the afternoons its really chill. You make friends that last a lifetime there, I would definitely recommend this job to any college student!"
good,"Starbucks was such a great job from my point of view. I would highly recommend anybody who loves to work an who’s in great shape. Great job, great people working together to get the job done."
good,"I uphold our values daily and believe in our mission statement: To inspire and nurture the human spirit one cup, one person, one neighborhood at a time."
good,"There is a need for better Managers with a better understanding of the older more ""Servant Leadership"" model that served the company so well for decades.    They have lost this aspect as they get their house in order, and the company no longer does a good job of developing their key people or vetting outside hires."
good,"I worked at a starbucks inside a giant in Maryland. I'll be focusing on the starbucks aspect, seeing as the store itself is another story. I enjoyed my time there greatly, the people were always caring and the employees were fun to work with!"
good,"It’s a fast pace work place, if you learn how to bar you can do pretty much anything. You have to be on top of your feet and not get frazzled easily or you would not make it."
good,"You got to learn about all different kinds of customers, especially regulars. Everyone was always in a good mood and willing to help. Hardest part of job was remembering all the steps of different drinks. Most enjoyable part of job was getting customers to try new things and them being happy with the result."
good,Starbucks was a very cultured atmosphere with a lot of room to improve ones customer service experience skills and improve guest's satisfaction. I learned a lot about the process of making coffee and Starbucks' QASA regulations that help ensure that their facilities maintain an exceptionally high standard of cleanliness. The management was okay. The hardest part of the job was realizing that by no means did Starbucks pay enough hourly and in my personal opinion just tried to compensate that with a lot of benefits. The most enjoyable part of being a barista was definitely forming relationships with the regulars and how fast the time flew by!
good,"Starbucks is for those who are willing to go the extra mile when working. A person must be willing to work at a fast pace but still be interactive with others, while still having fun at doing your job."
good,"I worked at a Starbucks in a Target store, which I realize is a bit different than the experience of working at a Starbucks stand alone retail store. The experience was just okay. As a Target Starbucks, we could not receive tips, nor could we receive any of the Starbucks benefits. Although we were doing all of the same duties as a normal Starbucks barista."
good,"I liked being able to interact with customers, craft customizable beverages, and provide great customer service. Starbucks is a great company to work in. The hardest part of the job was making sure everything is what the customer wants, even if they ""change their mind"" after their order was placed."
good,Worked in one store until the store was closed due to the outlet village being refurbished. Loved the work and enjoyed working with the company. I then moved to a different store where the manager was not as friendly as before. I thoroughly enjoy working in a fast paced envirnoment.
good,"As a purveyor of quality coffee, i was challenged  with the task of serving all kinds of coffee and teas. While demonstrating great customer service in a fast paced atmosphere, with supportive co workers and management. the best part of the job was sampling the new drinks and pastries."
good,"I had a good time working at Starbucks."
good,"starbucks is a wonderful place to work, I love what i do. its fast paced and fun, its whole different type of experience and the guests are a whole different breed in the best way."
good,"during my experience, in Starbucks Philippines, its fun and enjoy because your not making a beverage to enjoy but your making a culture that customers will satisfy his/her Starbucks experience."
good,Working at Starbucks as a Shift Supervisor helped me learn a lot of skills for after I graduated college. I left with the knowledge of how to manage other in a fast-paced and hectic environment.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great place to work at. I would train the new hires, interact with customers. Some were new, some were my regular customers."
good,"The only bad thing about working at a Starbucks where you get tips, is that only the Baristas who are ""certified"" get the tips. "
good,I generally like this place I just wasnt paid enough for where i was living in texas. But now I live in Florida. So I'd like to apply almost anywhere its desperately needed.
good,"The people make up the culture and it was a thrill to work with such smart, energetic people. Maybe the free coffee helped with all the energy. I would recommend working for this powerhouse Brand."
good,This was a great job to get through school or trying to figure out your next career. Flexible hours and support. They promote with company up till a certain level.
good,"Starbucks was a really fun place to work, during the ""rush"" hours it was very fast paced and exciting. I loved that you are never doing the  same thing and every work day is different."
good,I loved being able to open the store and be able to go home at 2pm. I had enough time to actually live my life outside of work. It is a very fast pace job but if you can keep up and deal with repetitive tasks you will love it.
good,"I like staying busy and there was always something productive to do and support from fellow staff and management. Working with customers was almost always fun, and i had an oppurtunity to have repeat customers which was fun to remember people by the coffee they drink."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work at. I had a nice fast paced shift each day at work. Starbucks was very diverse and had many opportunities in meeting new people. I think Starbucks managers needed more training and should have been well taught before offered positions. The hardest part of Starbucks was the hours were not flexible. I really enjoyed working at "
good,"In this economy having competitive pay is a top priority for many employees, including myself. Despite promotion, raises, and upward momentum, I’m barely making enough to pay my current bills let alone save up for my future."
good,Only worked there for a little while. But loved my time there. Great discounts on products and they do a fantastic job on training you. You really feel like you’re part of a team
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 6 years. I always wanted to be a shift supervisor. It took me 5 years to get it. After working diligently for a year, I was denied any forward movement with the company with no real reason given. Got me through college, that’s good enough for me."
good,"I enjoyed working with the Starbucks company, it was a fun company to work for and their was always room for advancement. My favourite part of the job was being a barista and making the drinks. I also ran shifts and was a trainer as well which kept me busy and made the time go by fast in a fun way. I would work for this company again."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, though I had an unfortunate experience at the particular location that I worked at. If it had not been for one or two employees, I would happily still be a barista for Starbucks - it is easily the best company I have ever worked for."
good,Starbucks is a great job just dont work at any of the ones on campus because its through another company and you dont get any Starbucks benefits and working on campus sucks.
good,"Great place to work. For me it was a great job to have post-college while I figured out what I wanted to do in life. My manager listened to my availability, the structure allowed me to learn and grow, and I look fondly back at my time there."
good,"The short time I did work at Starbucks, it was a very welcoming environment although very fast paced. I only worked such a short time because I was hired for a new job that worked better with my college schedule at the time and was a bit closer to home."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, especially while getting your degree. Great benefits and very flexible schedule. However,once you become a supervisor the career opportunities cease to exist as they generally hire externally for management."
good,"Great place to work In Austin Texas, Santa Rosa, CA and Indiana. You spend a lot of your day doing cleaning tasks and making drinks. It's important to connect with customers!"
good,"I enjoy being a shift manager. I've been doing it for a long time and it has been easy to stay here because I've met some really great people and I've enhanced my managing skills. However, I'm at the point where I  need to use my degree and have a career that I feel appreciated at."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing place to work for your first job! Teaches you discipline, respect and the value of hard work. The management team and customers will teach you how to be a respectful and great employee/manager."
good,"WhIle I was working at Starbucks it was friendly, a couple of gossiping but overall I liked working there. There's about two managers there who would seem to wake up on the bad side of the bed each shift I worked. I recommend working here for a first job."
good,Your typical day at Starbucks is quick moving with lots of team dependence. There is a huge push for roles and staying in assigned roles but there is also a constant desire for support roles.
good,I worked during here during college through a university program that only hired students.  It is hard to fully evaluate the company as many things were very different in this environment.  I did enjoy how they trained us and the customers.
good,"Good first job for college or highscool job "
good,Great Co-workers and it felt like a family. You do not get paid to much sadly which is the reason I had to leave. Highly recommend it to people looking for some spare cash.
good,"No matter how bad management was or how stressful the work place was, everyone was like a giant family. I loved my co-workers and how much they encouraged everyone to do and be better."
good,Starbucks needs good managers who are selective with the partners they hire in there store. A manager with people skills can easily inprove job culture by influencing every one to act in a specific way. A good manager can make or break any store and the customers know this.
good,"There have been celebrity guest appearances at 60 wall street location of starbucks. the tips aren't much compared to the location, however the store is very fast paced which leaves little time to focus directly on all customers in a personable aspect."
good,I kinda outgrew the job. It was time to move on. It was a lot of drama within the workplace. A lot of cattiness & betrayal. False hopes to be promoted & a lot of work related stress.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, but sometimes higher up management doesn’t seem to appreciate or care much about the lower employees and mostly only about the sales."
good,A typical day at work would start at 7:00 am. You would come in and set up and be down by 8:00 am. The rush would begin at 8:00 am on the dot. If you're in training it gets overwhelming that's why they start you as a cashier. It starts to slow down after 10:00 am. Its a decent day up until 4:00 pm again. You end up getting another rush again. My manager was never on the line AT ALL. She was always in the back of HR chatting it up with other managers and she would take every other week off. But other than that if was a great experience and I made a lot of cool friends.
good,"Starbucks was my first full time job. It was an excellent job that taught me how to interact with customers and coworkers, how to fix something done wrong, work in high stress environments and follow health and safety procedures."
good,"Starbucks has great benefits, and a fair living wage.  If you are looking to promote, this is a great environment. Supportive District Managers will provide a path to moving up, with regular meetings to check progress.  Scheduling is usually very flexible, so as to accommodate a school schedule or a second job."
good,"Pouvoir découvrir un autre métier"
good,"If you can ignore the rude customers, everything is good there. Sometimes management may seem a bit iffy but I believe they have somewhat good intentions."
good,"I worked for Starbucks twice. I enjoyed it enough when I was younger and it was my first job that I went back when I needed work to hold me over. Would not recommend long term but it's a decent company and if you find a good store with good people the work environment can end up being a lot of fun. Often the busier the store the better, in my experience."
good,Wonderful  work environment. Although while under new management the responsibility fell upon the barista and shifts to uphold a working environment without chaos as the new manager was being taught to run our store.
good,It can be a great job with the right crew working with you. You just have to like the fast paced nature of the job and being able to handle people at their worst when they come in.
good,"From start to finish, your day will go by in a flash. It's always a great time servicing customers ad getting to know them more, plus the knowledge of coffee is always so interesting to pick up and its always in nonstop growth,"
good,"Mgm is very well respected place to work, The weekends were the busiest and most enjoyable times to work. I learned a lot about working for Mgm and for starbucks, I have meet some great people working there. The hardest part about the job was getting home in the early mornings"
good,"Unfortunately, Starbucks is a great place to work, but one unprofessional DM can ruin it all.  I worked for a horrible DM who got rid of all the managers with kids, and replaced them with lower paid single mangers.  She was the worst DM I ever met. Never going back there.  She was 2 faced lier, and rude. She didn't even follow dress code."
good,"The culture enhances my carrier opportunity to grow.  I have grown my Management skill and Customer services skills in this company. "
good,"If you like to stay busy this is the place or you.  Perfect for high school or college student working while going to school, etc.  Low pay very + strenuous physical work."
good,"Starbucks was a blast to work at! Making drinks, food, and talking with customers was always fun. I enjoyed the challenge of dealing with an unexpected rush of customers, and making/inventing new drinks was great!"
good,"The Starbucks I worked at was in the library on USF campus. We were open 24/5 and were busy all of the time. Lines out the door, very hectic and sometimes stressful."
good,"manager got too involved personally with all employees making it hard and uncomfortable to balance work and outside lives and keeping them separate."
good,Deals with a lot of customer service on a daily basis. My current store has a drive thru. Everyone on the floor needs to do their part efficiently. It is important to keep up the customer service even when trying to get customers in and out in a short amount of time.
good,"This has been one of the most interesting jobs that I have ever had. Even though I wasnt there for too long, it felt like i was there forever. Met many great friends and managed to grow a lot as a person."
good,"This was my favorite job!"
good,"working in starbucks is super fun, you will meet different customers. new friends, it will develop your teamwork skills, my knowledge for customer service become deeper,"
good,"When I first started my task was to cook the food in the ovens or customer support. When working with the ovens it gets pretty hot and boring when you're standing there all day, and working customer service is fast paced because you have to make sure everyone has what they need and the store looks presentable."
good,Excellent people work at Starbucks. There was a high  turnover of management personnel. The workload was very high but managable.  I would work there again if I lived closer to Seattle.
good,"- Doing a same works doing drinks"
good,"Worked there for eight years and loved it. It is hard work and sometimes thankless. Just like anywhere you go there will be great people and managers, and terrible people and managers."
good,"Starbucks is a great company where I learnt a lot. I learn great time-management, efficiency, professionalism and how to make some awesome latte art! Being a part of an awesome crew who supports one another is what makes the workplace culture and the job really enjoyable."
good,The customers and my regular are my favorite part of my job. I enjoyed having meaningful conversations with them and getting to make them smile once they leave the store.
good,very busy since it is located on college campus. lots of standing and walking. most customers are regulars and came in multiple times a day. it is easy to get to know people and their orders
good,"I love Starbucks overall, so it was great to work here and learn how to make each drink. The hardest part is telling the customers ""Sorry, But We're Out Of ...."" The Culture is very life changing, Starbucks is  a learning, enjoyable melting pot."
good,I loved my job at starbucks if I could have made a livable wage there I would have continued to work there. It is a great company to be apart of if you need a part time job.
good,"Very fast pace and in your face work enviorment, the customers are what can make your day but then there are certain ones that can absolutely break your day."
good,"You'll make a tonne of friends. Your coworkers are at the same point in life as you are so it's easy to get along with them. Its also very convenient for students to go to work before, in between or after class."
good,if you love free coffee this is the place for you! weekly tips. fun work environment. management can be a bust. fun coworkers. incentives. free 1 pound of coffee per week.
good,I believe Starbucks is an ecellent place for people with no experience to gain some. It has helped build on my skills as an effective person of communications. It has also helped improve not only people skills but also working in a fast paced environment. But for someone who is looking to further a career it is only temporary.
good,"Its a nice starter company, but it is the Starbucks way or no way at all.  If you can be flexible and listen to instructions you will do great. Also working hard is helpful."
good,Working for Starbucks was not difficult it was very stressful at times considering I worked at the busiest store in the district. I enjoyed the customers and the pets the customers would bring.
good,"Working at Starbucks was one of the best experiences I've had with an employer thus far. For the most part the managers were always helpful and willing to work around scheduling issues and my fellow partners were almost always a pleasure to work with. The worst part about working at Starbucks, is the customers. Due to Starbucks high customer service standards customers have now taken to using the kind policies to receive free or discounted drinks even if there wasn't anything wrong with what they ordered. The worst part about being a Barista is the customers."
good,"Brewing and serving coffee to customers."
good,The company helps teach you but they don't really allow you to be able to continue growing and compensate for the work one does. The  management was great in the people skills but not all to great in the organized section possibly due to the fact that they didn't allow for a assistant even though their were to many workers.
good,"coffee is always the product i love, and i always enjoy a good cup of coffee, so when i speak and serve a good quality coffee its very obvious alover my face, and i know the customers will be sutisfied becuse i gave them the coffee they really needed, when they leave the store, i need to know they had the best time and the service and the  product meet their expectations"
good,"The expectation of ""understanding"" everyone that works for you...that they may or may not come to work, that the previous managers may have not followed starbucks standards, makes the job a challenge."
good,In this job you will learn a million and one drink recipes but it is fun and awesome to know. Coffee becomes a lifestyle. It's a very busy job that allows you to learn how to become an outstanding worker.
good,Learned how to serve good coffee in a fast pace enviroment. Best part was connecting with customers and being able to help them have a good day. Hardest part of the job was when they got rid of all the cafe establishment and made it manditory to have a drivethrough.
good,comfortable and fun workplace at starbucks because starbucks's staff is so friendly and this culture can provide a happy customer.
good,"cafe is my love , cafe tasting , connecting with costumers getting new  stories of there taste exchanging knowledge , work in rush exciting .every day is a new start and get new learning from it .."
good,Free good food and coffee.worst part is the customers 5 percent are nasty and rude other 95 are great everyday people. They offer a great stock plan thats made me thousands of dollars ive never really notice out my check.
good,Have an great time working there the people were wonderful the job was awesome i learned so many thing working there i loved putting smiles on peoples faces early morning it was a great feeling ill miss working there
good,its very nice feeling to work in this company with my awesome collegue everyday there is something to learn i really love to interact with the customer as we get new ideas and lesson from some of the customer also with a good feed back.
good,"Serves drinks to customers, manage a proper multitasking work."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for and they will work with you to help you in the best ways possible. The Cup Fund helps struggling baristas, plus the tips are a nice way to start saving."
good,At times it is very hard to work with people who don't like you. Other times the only way you get through is by the grace of your co-workers who love you.
good,Starbucks was a good job for me because I am very task oriented. It was fast paced but relatively easy to pick up. The hardest part of the job was rushes. We could have up to 20 cups in line on the bar and still have a huge line at Point of Sale. Being a barista is a high stress job.
good,"Be prepared. This isn't a job for everyone. I've had people of all ages, most of the older folks quitting on me, saying it's too much. A barista makes drinks, rings customers, cleans, you name it. We do a lot, and in a short amount of time. Customers, as picky as they can be, can be exhausting, and unfortunately, they negatively attack and blame and finger point. However, this isn't all customers, as some you will learn the names of, and remember, and miss. It can be very rewarding, or it can be very stagnant. Do not apply if you wanted to stand around. If you are a hard worker, you will advance quickly, but Starbucks discourages standing around; there is always a task to be completed. Be prepared to think critically and have the best customer service, or you will drown. The training for a barista is short and simple, but it's teaching extensive subjects, so pay attention, and WATCH and LEARN. It's a very visual and hands-on job."
good,"Starbucks is very hard work. They do pay above the minimum and offer all sorts of perks that make up for the poor raises that they give. If you want to learn about business work here, as it will shape you into a hard worker. Long strenuous hours, but worthy  it if you're young and need a job while getting through school. They don't pay the best so its not a long term career."
good,Plenty of opportunities if you're looking to move up. Days can be grueling but in the end this place is alright enough. Get to know all your coworkers and customers to make life simple.
good,"Working at Starbucks for three years has given me a chance to develop helpful skills for the future. "
good,"I really enjoyed coming into work and seeing all of my usual customers bright and early in the mornings. I also enjoyed getting to meet many of the new faces we would see day to day. My co-workers were nothing, but the greatest. I had the opportunity to build friendships that will last lifetimes."
good,"customer service is always about making the customer happy, i have learned to be patient and understand to customers"
good,"They have a professional aspect and make sure that all their employees receive anything they need in a timely manner.  We were usually busy at work, which made the day go by quicker. Learning how to make drinks was an easy task and is quick to learn.  Some days are hard when working a shift by yourself but I get through it with a positive attitude! I love getting to know our customers, which we have many usual's in which we know by name and know their drink."
good,I loved working for Starbucks!  The atmosphere is great and co workers make everything fun. I had the best manager. I really enjoyed working here. The only reason I had left is because the pay is RIDICULOUS. They really could manage to pay is more being such a big multi million dollar company. Other than that I loved it and wish i could have stayed and I would of if I had been paid more.
good,"great opportunities"
good,"A typical day at Starbucks consists of overseeing employees and communicating with regional and corporate offices "
good,"I really loved working at Starbucks! Great people, great co-workers and discounts. It was fun learning about all the different coffees and having coffee and food paring classes."
good,This job has great benefits. Its a lot to do but it has great benefits. Hardest part of the job is having to constantly hire and train. Turn over rate is very high.
good,"The customers can be very aggressive, but I learned you don't have to go home with them so do whatever it takes to make them happy. I do feel like management uses scare tactics and harsh criticism, and can be very unprofessional at times. My co-workers are amazing. I work with some of the coolest people, but some of the newer employees are not trained very well so the experienced workers end up picking up the slack. The hardest part of the job would be trying to balance your personal lief with your work life Starbucks can be very draining, specially when customers are not happy.The best part about the job is when you do make that connection with a stranger and you make their drink right or you just went above and beyond the genuine thank you that you get from a customers could change your whole day!"
good,"They work with your schedule and there are many different shifts available. The customers can be rude and high maintenance but there are many regulars that are very friendly, too."
good,"I loved working at starbucks, managing there was really difficult, however i learned so much at a very young age. Starbucks is a very serious company and has many rules and regulations, especially about tattoos and piercings, being an artist i have a few of these and it made working there difficult. however it was a great place."
good,"Starbucks is a very fun place to work. Customers think that it's just coffee but Batista's looked at it as art. I wanted to always make the perfect drink and make it visually appealing to them. It's a fast working position which made it more fun. It was a temporary position. I worked the drive-thru and had a customer that kept telling me that he loved my customer service and kept begging me to work for him. He gave me his business card, and it had a golf cart on it. I was thinking there was no way I was going to sell golf products. It just so happened that I finally gave him an interview and was hired that day- Tampa g Mfg. Co. It was not selling golf products, it was an admin position."
good,*Great company culture.  Good work/life balance. opportunities for community service & special projects abound...  Employee discount is great
good,"In a typical day as a supervisor I get the store set up and then delegate tasks to the other baristas. I then mange the cash drawers and check emails to make sure everything is running to par. I balance time placing orders with working on the floor directly interacting with customers. The most difficult part of my job is dealing with and resolving issues that can arise between employees and customers. There is a fine line between treating a customer with the ""customer is always right"" attitude and realizing when further steps need to be taken. The best part of my job is having amazing coworkers and to talk with all the wonderful customers who come in daily."
good,"A typical day includes cash handling, cleaning, inventory management, food handling, customer service and answering the phone.  I learned many skills to advance my ability to help customers, manage inventory and communicating with co-workers.  The management is great.  They are easy to talk to, great at helping fix any problems that arise and help to better your working career.  My co-workers are always helpful and make a great working environment.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the public in a retail setting.  There are times that nothing goes right and the customers take their anger out on you.  The best part of the job is when you can make someones day.  Just seeing a smile on their faces when the have entered in a bad mood makes it all worth it."
good,"As a barista, you are expected to be able to make drinks in a timely manner and deal with the occasional rude or impatient customer. If you don't let the stress or annoying customers bother you or get under your skin everything else is easy peasy. More often than not, your fellow partners are quirky and fun to work with (at least that's been my experience). The benefits are pretty good, you only have to work a minimum of 20 hours a week to qualify. Plus, you get free drinks when you're on shift and soon a free meal as well. Not too shabby!"
good,Working at Starbucks is very fun. It may get very hectic but that makes a work day go by super fast. I love the coffee.
good,"Friendly and knowledgeable, Learned how to make various caffeinated beverages. Hardest part of the job was the consistence of working alone."
good,"Fast paced, with high expectations from co-workers and customers."
good,"Working at Starbucks can be a very fun place, the store I worked for was very fast faced and slowed down occasionally.  I never had any complaints."
good,"This job was very fun and a great form of self expression through our drink making. This job was a combination of stress and excitement. the stress would build up when we would run promotions bunch as buy one get ones, other than that though the job was joyful because of the relationships built with our guests."
good,"The company within Canada has lost sight of what it was that made Starbucks stand out. Unfortunately they have hired externally instead of promoting within, so the management most times ends up being useless at best. I had the unfortunate experience if dealing with a manager that bullied her partners and degraded and disrespected even  the customers."
good,"its an ok job"
good,Make drinks all day and converse with customers. Clean and stock all areas of the workstation.
good,I learned to work all machines and interact with people at the ame time. I was able to run stands alone without and supervision. I love the customers. they became apart of my daily life and close like family.
good,"Working at Starbucks was stressful at first. It was a challenge to remember all of the drinks and working the POS. After about a week and a half everything came into to place and i felt at ease. I learned quickly therefore everything became more fun. I love being friendly to people and making new friends, this was the perfect environment to do so."
good,"A typical day at work was fun and up-beat.  I learned core concepts to being a good barista and providing exceptional customer service (customers always come first).  In the time working at starbucks, there were several managers.  Some came with lots of experience while others were lazy and did not accomplish much nor participate.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers and made many friends. The hardest part of the job was always striving to make everyone happy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my ""partners"". Being a barista was an enjoyable job and the daily tasks were constructive."
good,Fun place to work with great staff. Great regulars and conversations. You can have fun on the job as long as you can multi-task. The management is good the boss is friendly and happy. I have learned that you can meet amazing people that soon cross the line of customer and become friends. The hardest part of the job is remembering all the drinks that you have to make. The co workers are friendly and willing to help should you need it and always making you feel welcome. the most enjoyable part of the job as I said before is the customers that you get to know and can call friends.
good,I learned I enjoyed many different coffees. Also loved the many different teams I worked with.
good,"the job always was never busy.management was so bad.they never helped you.never showed you work,you had to come in and just find something to do."
good,"It gets busy but you can still keep it fun, all depend on the management."
good,Love making coffee and helping people This was a good job but needed more out of a job.
good,"All I can say about 4 years of working at Starbucks is that it is LABOR. You are on your feet 4 to 8 hours at a time, EXPECTED to always say yes to your customers no matter how ridiculous they get (unless they have no receipt....)"
good,"Starbucks is completely made by the people who work there. Having worked with the company for seven years, I have seen full staffs come and go. The great thing about the company is that they invest so much in their employees. They are consistent with providing two full weeks of training to their staff members, which is unheard of for a coffee shop, but necessary for grooming staff who are able to fill in at any other store in the nation. I am so happy to have been part of this great company and family of people."
good,"I have always been a fan of Starbucks for the atmosphere and friendly staff, which is why I chose to apply to work there."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing environment, upbeat and fun, great place to interact with people make coffee bring smiles to people!"
good,"The company itself was great at training new workers. It was fun making new drinks and such. It was a 2 week process to train us, but it went by rather quickly."
good,The work environment is really awesome. And the people are amazing. Management is different at each location some are amazing and others not so much. But i loved every moment of being there.
good,"Family atmosphere and a great place to work. My only complaint is the management is not good. The corporate head office is also not good. This is due to the fact that the head office has a lot of complaints, but none of these people have actually worked in a Starbucks."
good,Enjoyed my time working here. Made lots of friends and developed my communication and leadership skills by running shifts and taking on more responsibility.
good,"The started early and was busy from open to close. It was nice, the management was really good and it was a great leaning experience of how to deal closely with customers."
good,"The work environment can be great considering how it feels like you're surrounded by friends. The skills required to excel at this job are attainable and quick to learn. Beanstock is great introduction into acquiring free stock and building your 401k.  However, my biggest complaint comes from where the managements begins to lack. Night shifts tend to be understaffed and have the most responsibilities. The management can be slow on promotions, and tend to favor partners for everything aside from work performance. Overall a great job but management will make you feel burnt out."
good,"I always enjoyed my time at Starbucks yet whenever things got more hectic or slow it would fail at times. Through the fellow workers would not  hold their weight as  apart of a team whether calling out, just not showing up leaving two workers to close the entire store."
good,"Very nice company to work for they care about their employees and the cup fund is really awesome it help me in a time of need. The only thing that sucked was some of my coworkers, but that has nothing to do with the company"
good,Was amongst the hardest and.most reliable workers on the floor. Constantly picking up shifts and working doubles for the team teamxxonly.to.be fored for s name tag.missing weks.befkre I had my.dsughter. be fired be
good,"Great work environment, staff, and cleanness. Enjoyed working at Starbucks as a part time job during college. The hours were flexible and I was able to maintain my studies."
good,Doesn't pay enough not enough hours  but I loved working here. Customer service is something I enjoy and interacting with people. I love coffee and learning about its origins as well
good,I was hired at Starbucks in High School and have been promoted after about a year and a half of being there. I have also gotten small raises throughout my time with this Company. I have tried transfering with this company and have had a poor rate of importance in doing so.
good,The hours are very flexible and the schedule works. My mangers keeps our store clean and organized maintains the happiness of employees. The benefits are amazing.
good,Starbucks works hard to create a third place for their customers. Making it like a second home or study place. Very friendly staff that is super welcoming.
good,"Starbucks is a face paced, fun, energetic, job that will always keep you busy. They "
good,"Easy job, fun to work but face paced. Same routine everyday so you can easily get the hang of things. Management is different at every store because I worked at 3 different ones. After training, it takes a few weeks to get the hang of things and it becomes second nature."
good,My overall experience at Starbucks has been a good one. They are flexible with hours and provide you with great benefits. I would recommend this job to somebody who is good at making customer connections and who cares about the quality of their customer service.
good,"Starbucks taught me a lot of things for my future roles. It taught me to deal with difficult people. Also, taught me how to multitask. It also taught me how to provide exceptional customer service. Work culture was like a family."
good,"My experience was really good. I enjoyed working there. It was stressful some days but I learned a lot. Management is good. You will learn how to interact with customers, how to do multiple tasks at a time and how to make customers happy."
good,Working in starbucks is good we communicate well to all customers with well manner attitude..We delivered our services and products a in high standard
good,Management were typically perfectionist and could use some classes on how to productively give feedback. I worked at a couple Starbucks and it was a common trend among all of them.
good,Starbucks barista was a very stressful job but I loved it none the less . The employees there have good chemistry which makes team work easy. Communication was a huge part of the Starbucks team and I’m really glad I got to be a part of that
good,A lot is required of you with very low pay . They are very well prepared for anything and have everything every step is planned well and efficiently. The customers I enjoyed
good,"Starbucks was a fun company to work for in my early 20s they offer free schooling and many benefits, it can be pretty stressful and there is always a goal to hit."
good,"a typical day at work arrive and be greeted by all my baristas. I will smile and greet them as well."
good,It was a fun environment with lots of things to learn. The job challenges you to work efficiently. You work on your memory and communication skills. You can express yourself how you’d like to.
good,This job was a great job while I was in college. Hours were fairly flexible. The pay was livable. I enjoyed my crew mates. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks! Starbucks was my first job and I started working at the age of 16 and worked until I graduated College. I did deal with difficult customers, but the amazing customers and the connections I made kept me going. If you have a chance to work at Starbucks, then do it!"
good,"I fully enjoy the work culture of Starbucks, it creates a warm community of friends. I've only ever worked at privately owned stores which made upholding the values of Starbucks along with that of the owner very difficult. Otherwise from barista, to supervisor, to trainer then finally manager, Starbucks is a company that helps people grow, no matter what the roots of the Starbucks culture always provides a comfortable workplace."
good,They offer great benefits as well as work around your schedule. Good company to work for. Great starter job if you’re in college and needing some extra cash.
good,"I have had many friends love their job at the bux, however I've also heard negatives. Unfortunately, I had a manager that was not helpful. She did not like employees to get a second job. Back story about starbucks, as a barista you do not get guaranteed hours unless you are a lead, this was hard has a young adult with bills to pay. My manager also made my take my lunch break at only 2 hours into my shift (because of rush hour), at this point in time I worked two jobs, so me having a ""lunch"" break at 7am when I work till 11pm, was not quite ideal for me."
good,Fun environment. The company has many values I agree with. Fast pace on shifts and lots to do. The general feel of the place is laid back and welcoming.
good,"It was a good time, but the manager was a bit disorganized. Overall though, it was a great place to work. Despite the poor organization, the position is the reason I wish to continue working as a barista."
good,"Nice place for begginners,great place to work and multi culture.Their coffee is one of the best in the world and recommend by everyone.Great team members from different areas of the world"
good,Starbucks is a great company for young people looking to work in environment that teaches you customer service and patience within others I have learned so much about social interactions while working there
good,My time working at Starbucks really helped me keep me on my toes. The fast pace and minimal employees allow me to have to learn skills quickly. Where I worked there were 1-2 employees working at location. This made it difficult to be able to take breaks.
good,I had a wonderful experience working for Starbucks. My team helped create a fun and efficient environment to work in. I learned a lot in my time spent working at Starbucks.
good,I've learned how to multitask and complete work faster and efficiently. Also maintaining conversations with customers while making drinks and taking orders.
good,"Customers were great, there is always something to do, it smells amazing and the benefits were great. You got 2 free items a day and a small discount."
good,A great place to work at. some shifts were very stressful due to understaffing and ridiculous goals that were based on the management direction. It all depends on the managers role but the people and environment is great
good,"I love working here! Between being a full time student and a full time supervisor, it is a little rough to balance the two. I am branching out to other companies because I have been with the company for two and a half years, graduating in another two and still don't know what I want to do with my life. Very fun, very welcoming to all types of skill levels and all types of people. Including customers and workers."
good,"On a regular day it was mostly busy since I was an opener. Everything required wasn't too hard to catch onto seeing as I'm a fast learner. During my duration working there I had two managers, the first being very well knowledged and  the second being new and messy. Despite the last months becoming hectic because of the new management, I still very much enjoyed my time there."
good,"I loved Starbucks. Too many task became alvailable. Goals weren’t achievable. Fast paced environment, diverse, very structured and systematic. Many different focused areas."
good,"Learned a lot of management techniques and communication skills."
good,"Working for Starbucks taught me how to b time consuming, listening skills, and for the most part organization ! Yeah it gets tuff when you have to make ah drink specifically to the customer liking rather than the recipe. But overall it’s great practice for social skills and understanding others ."
good,"Starbucks is very flexible its work pattern, its great if you have a busy schedule at home, eg. looking after the kids. "
good,Workplace culture could be determined by manager.  Benefits are good. They offered full tuition reimbursement for your first bachelor's degree if you attended ASU online.
good,you need to know what youre doing. you only have a certain amount of days to figure out what the basic concepts are and how to make basic popular drinks. if you cant catch on youre fired.
good,Very good company to work for. I would recommend this job to fellow students that are in school while trying to accomplish education goals. I would also recommend this to any one looking for good workplace benefits.
good,"Fun place to work everyone is happy and friendly, always willing to help customers are typically nice and easygoing, you do get tips on a weekly basis & learning is always fun. Management is garbage lots of favoritism and poor scheduling no balance or constant schedule."
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great place to work at. You interact with other people and break out of your shell. You learn how to be efficient and less about perfection, except when you make the drinks. You will be bounced around the store floor, either being on bar making drinks, being at the register taking orders, warming food, or doing store upkeep."
good,"I could not sustain myself in the slow seasons, but that is everywhere. I enjoyed the culture and quick pace work.  I learned easily with good coworkers."
good,"I worked for Starbucks as a barista for a little over 3 years and absolutely loved it. I met amazing people I had the pleasure of working alongside. We worked well together as teams and while the customers could sometimes be difficult, the regulars that I met were wonderful people."
good,I think starbucks is a great place to get the warehouse experience. The people are professional and very welcoming. The team work is great. Just make sure you’re able to stand for long periods of time
good,"Starbucks has it’s own standard when it comes to quality and I loved how they implemented those standards. It is very fulfilling whenever I witness the satisfaction of the customers towards our service. Working in Starbucks made me realize why people have to pay much more for a cup of coffee. It is not about the brand or coffee itself, it is about the partners that makes the coffee and the store more alive and indeed a third place to have."
good,"Because Starbucks is such a large company, it's impossible to judge it based on one store. It's important to find a store that has the culture you're looking for."
good,Even though it was a good job it was filled with drama. The drama between management and the other employees was overwhelming. The fact that management did nothing when there was so much drama was pathetic
good,"The company provides great growth opportunity and benefits. Fast paced environment. For the demands of the job, the wages are low. Some micromanaging from the DM."
good,"For the time i have worked at starbucks , it has been a good experience. I have matured in a work manner and have seen more responsibility in the workplace."
good,"Redefined what leadership means to me."
good,I enjoyed my first manager and asm but my second manager and asm made it into an unwelcoming environment so I had to leave. Overall I loved Starbucks and would go back.
good,"I was working at a grossly understaffed location. Work-life balance was a foreign concept. Benefits were great but they won't hesitate to drop you. Management was... apathetic. Yet somehow, every barista at my location was willing to give their all for our branch. I have yet to find employees so devoted to their work."
good,Good occupation to pursue. Most enjoyable part was building relationships with my colleagues and the customers. Most difficult was the different personalities that came with the diversity in hires but once able to make it work is very pleasant with such a awesome place to enjoy a awesome company.  Tips was a benefit being there paid weekly and split between coworkers for how much hours you put in and the covered drinks and one meal was nice while you were on the clock on break.
good,"Working at Starbucks can be fun or draining simply depending on location . Location is key to you staying in this job or getting burnt out fairly quickly. Before applying to just about anywhere , scout the location out to see how it gets in it’s down time and during its peek rush hours. Get past that and you’ll have smooth sailing when you find the right place."
good,"At Starbucks, there was always work to be done. Typically the work was done as a team where each person had a certain role that was assigned at the beginning of the shift by the manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers satisfied with the service provided to them."
good,A typical work day was pretty busy but the team environment was great everyone got along really well and tried to give each customer a personal experience .
good,"I really did enjoy working for this company I honestly am considering going back because i have yet to find a job that really compares to the work lifestyle i had with this company, just plan going to a different store."
good,"Quite laid back, very tiring. Long hours. You develop good customer interaction skills. Cannot really fault the job. Good for students or people needing an easy part-time job."
good,"Fun and friendly environment. No real problems until you have to go to management or an actual harassment situation occurs. Trans and nonbinary members aren't helped when problems with discrimination happen. besides that, the pay is well, but hours can vary from location."
good,"If you follow everything that Starbucks trains you to do, no matter how frustrating or time-consuming, you will see that everything fits into place--from time management to fulfilling the company mission."
good,"I like serving the public, but Starbucks has so many regulations now, and targets.  I think they work us to the point of exhaustion.  Sometimes we cannot staff enough people for a shift because they are trying to keep  costs down.  It doesn't always make for good customer service."
good,I would come in and make a fresh pot of coffee and then dump out the old ones. I would then come in and get straight to work. I took customer's orders and made their drinks or warmed up their sandwiches. I also would help them make a choice if that came up. The hardest part was closing but it could have been worse.
good,I love working with the public. I have a friendly outgoing personality and the job fits me well. I have a very good memory and can memorize names and drinks.
good,"Working at starbucks can be hectic at time but being that i work on campus, i tend to work with students like myself and its a great time. Starbucks is very organized and structured which makes my shifts run smoothly"
good,I enjoyed my time there. I really loved everyone I was working with. The one I worked at was inside of a Randall’s so it came with other responsibilities as well but I loved it.
good,"It was great at first. As a college student, it works well with your schedule and you can work usually as many hours as you want. When peak time comes, it can get somewhat stressful and you're often doing many things at once and are expected more than what you can give. Overall, it's a good place to work, but for me, it is not a great long-term place."
good,"Great place to work, awesome skills developed and enjoyed the customer interaction. I loved meeting so many people and getting to know the regulars. I also enjoyed getting to know my coworkers and help train the new baristas."
good,Most of the time we were busy so you had to get into the swing of things very fast when you got to work. People do test you but you have to fight through that and have great customer service skills.
good,"I worked at 4 locations, 3 of which being awesome! The most recent one was so poorly managed that I ended up quitting so If you want to work for Starbucks, I would try to get a feel for which location has the best vibe."
good,"A Typical day of work -usually so busy..I improved my people skills, merchandising skills and managerial skills. The hardest part of the job was to clean all equipment and area by the end of shift. Most enjoyable part when the employee could have their breaks and choose any beverage free of cost as an employee."
good,My time at Starbucks was nothing short of a blast. To work with a tema who wants you to develop and become bigger than you could have imagines is awesome. Support during hard time family issues and school Starbucks is always there. It is a company who believes in its team members and it shows
good,apertura del negozio con vari obbiettivi giornalieri da raggiungere
good,los principios sobre los que se basaba la evaluación de los productos artísticos están en entredicho
good,"I loved the company and left on good terms but I feel as a partner (non-manager) would be treated with a lot of respect but in terms of being a manager, there is a lot of stress and pressure to succeed."
good,A typical day at work can be very overwhelming because some shift may pass off the floor in a mess and a gives you no time to reset the floor if there is nothing you have to make the drinks or ready coffee for the customers. I feel like some people at my work place doesn't care about the other partners that have to come in after them or understand what teamwork means
good,They work around your schedule well. You give them your availability and are legally binded to abide by it. They offer benefits and just 20 hrs a week which is rare.
good,"On busy days I knew what my regulars ordered, so I would have in mind how to make the drinks to their recommendations. At the counter I was quickly amendment on learning drink recipes  and beverage preparation. The management was spare and some days so was the items to prepare said drink, however that did not stop me from offering other recommended drinks or finding a solution to fit the problem. Guest service is one of the most enjoyable experiences in working as a barista, pleasing someone with their favorite cup of beverage in the morning before work or after a long night of studying."
good,I enjoyed working at starbucks mostly because of the people I was around all day. The interactions that you have with others teaches you about yourself as well as learning to communicate with different types of people.
good,"Great job you will meet lots of like minded individuals, however, the management at several locations has declined steadily with starbucks popularity rising. The managers are overworked and subsequently they cannot and will not tend to their fellow employees in a professional and cordial manner. I don't blame them. I blame Starbucks corporate for implementing such rigorous and absurd rules on them and working them to the ground. "
good,"I like working at Starbucks, my partners are approachable and friendly and make my working time enjoyable. The manager helps out whenever we have our busy hours. The schedule is very flexible."
good,During my time at Starbucks I met many customers and worked with different people that made the job easy to go to when waking up in the morning. My favorite part is making the drinks all the different recipes for each one is exciting to learn it is even better when you hand out the drank and get to see the satisfied customer get their drank.
good,"Loved working here, just got to be a bit hectic being a new mom and not having a set schedule hours. The people are awesome depending on the management scheduling can be alright."
good,I love the company.  I am extremely grateful for the health benefits and paid education but I couldn't support myself on the salary.  This would have been fine if there were growth opportunities.  I would have even relocated for a better position but I wasn't supported even when I made an individual effort to demonstrate my commitment to the company.
good,a typical day at work could vary between fast or slow paced. I was able to learn to how to  make drinks and notes were posted in the event someone were to forget.Management was for the most part good. they weren't always understanding when time was needed off however. the hardest part of the job was by far the pace at which things moved.
good,Starbucks was a great job to work at while in school. I definitely recommend working at Starbucks for younger individuals and for those that need a job with flexible hours.
good,I did a project for a group through Illinois State University College of Business. I was not employed by starbucks. This was an internship not a full time job or part time job.
good,"Good company for someone who is just starting out in customer service and wants to gain some experience. Low pay, but good discounts. And usually very fun/nice coworkers!"
good,I just want to share how amazing starbucks was. Its a very great pleasure to work here. The MoDs were so kind and understanding. I will not forget how amazing starbucks was
good,I absolutely loved working for this company. Benefits and pay are fantastic. Partners are treated with fairness and respect. I would strongly recommend this company as a company to grow within.
good,Not a bad place to work but advancing up can take some time. But you get to meet a lot of cool people and make some pretty good drinks the free stuff is the best
good,"Working there during school made it easy to make extra change. I learned how to work fast and efficiently, making drinks with ease and consistently for each customer."
good,The benefits are amazing at this job and the coworkers are generally easygoing and cool people. Culture varies depending on the Store Manager/ District Manager for each location. It's almost impossible to get fired from Starbucks.
good,Overall I didn’t enjoy working here. I was in happy with many things. For one I felt like a outsider with the coworkers. I felt  like I didn’t fit in.
good,"Fun place to work"
good,As a whole starbucks is a great company. The management is the worst part about working there. Dyed hair and some piercings were allowed as well as choosing what you feel comfortable wearing with loose guidelines.
good,"Rude customers and busy store. Good job progression. Friendly staff and worldclass training. Long shifts sometimes and short breaks, on your feet all day so can take a toll"
good,"Loved working for Starbucks! Was there for almost a decade!! Everyday was something new, fun, and stressful! Not too much in the way of advancement, unless cold rainy Seattle is your cuppa tea."
good,"I enjoyed making coffee for customers and developing relationships with regular customers. I had issues with management, but that was just one manager and could have easily transferred to another Starbucks if need be. The hardest part of the job were inconsolable customers during rushes."
good,I had a blast working with my co workers. I made new friends with them easily. However there was one manager that did not let me do what I was hired to do. (Bar tend) she made me clean and stock. 4 hours a shift 3 days a week. She then took away all my hours and left me with one day a week for 4 hours. She was very unfair and rude.
good,"It's been a fun job for the most part, but it's not my line of work, if you want to get into being creative then this is a great job for you. The people are really nice, the food and coffee is good, you can always meet amazing new people everyday and make wonderful friends."
good,"Management was not very good, but co workers were very friendly and willing to assist when needed. The hardest part about the job was having to keep up with all of the drinks that'd to be made when we had a big rush. The most enjoyable part about the job was that satisfaction that the customer received from their drink."
good,"Starbucks is the company you go into for excitement and thriving atmosphere, they have life changing customers, and offer a creative ways to reinvent yourself. Starbucks provides a place of freedom to be yourself in an environment that protects your status, they go above and beyond to help employees with any issues they may have. Starbucks could improve their pay, but for their flexibility and hour availability they are reasonable."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks and everything that it had to offer. Worked very well with my availability and my managers/co-workers were always happy to help!
good,"I loved working as a barista but couldn't afford the parking - not making enough to pay for parking and 30 minute commute, tried to transfer to closer location, no jobs available."
good,Starbucks has a lot to offer from benefits to paying for college. They are a great company that really wants all of you to be a part of it. There is a lot of room to advance and move up.
good,Starbucks is a great place to build valuable and transferable working experience. It is a face-paced environment that is all about providing excellent service. Starbucks shares the story of the coffee bean with each barista and training is provided to nurture those ideals while craving every drink.
good,Great job for young adults fresh out of high school or in college. I want to stay but not receiving enough benefits and can't prosper as I would like to.
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks, we have a fun and fast paced culture in our store and the partners I work with are great and charismatic people. The day starts off fast with a rush of people at the door, but we can usually manage it, even though sometimes we are not staffed properly. Management overall can be poor but that is due to many factors not just the mangers themselves, the partners don't always fill out availability forms out on time, and swap shifts without letting a manger know. But all in all I have worked here for 3 years and still enjoy working for the company."
good,"If you don't do well under pressure or hate a fast paced environment, DO NOT work here. However, every day was pretty much the same and there were basic routines to follow."
good,"Great working atmosphere, as well as strong focus on caring for customers both internal (employee) and extern. Facilitates a warm family atmosphere that encourages development"
good,"Fun place to work, co-workers work together as a team but there could be better communication in regards to breaks and relief. High turnaround with Management"
good,"I was one of the youngest workers but got promoted fairly quickly. My manager was wonderful and caring but many of my coworkers took advantage of that. They would either not show up to work on time or not come to work at all because there were little consequences. However, after talking to my manager she started to realize that the environment at work was becoming unbearable. She became more strict but maintained the loving, caring character that we knew and loved. "
good,"Starbucks has its days some days it can be very stressful depending on your staff during the day. Its a easy Job once you get down pack, working at starbucks taught me great customer service and money management that I can carry over to another field. The most enjoyable part of my job is serving and making drinks I get a kick out of it seeing my craft develop."
good,"Overall, friendly staff and customers, and work environment. Turn over in staff is frequent as it is often seen as a part time job, and lots of managers have come and gone, all with different intentions of how to run the same store."
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for. Great benefits, very flexible on work hours. Only down side was the pay wasn't great, I always had to pick up extra shifts at other locations to make my bills."
good,Starbucks really follows its culture and it is evident in the training. Work life balance isn't really an option but that is the same in any retail environment. Pay is average compared to other retail positions. A lot of freedom to do what you think is best.
good,"Unlike most other companies, ""being nice"" is a major part of Stabucks' culture. People are helpful and genuinely interested in helping each other, even if they have never met you before."
good,The atmosphere at Starbucks was a team.  We all were friends and understood each had person had different needs to feel safe. My manager was kind and understanding.
good,"I enjoyed interacting with customers on such a consistent basis. Many had standard orders or quirks and we would talk on a daily basis similar to visiting with work friends or gym acquaintances. It involved learning a great deal about good time management and being aware of your surroundings and the situation at all times."
good,"I love serving the people. The connections that i made is what will make me go back. I enjoy placing smiles on the faces of other people. No matter what i was doing, my goal was to be sure that the people left satisfied."
good,"Great company, terrible employee hiring process. Management lack operational knowledge. Management shall have monthly meetings, if so, reinforce these meeting a to occur for successful consistency."
good,My time at Starbucks was amazing. The staff was like family was very accomodating and the manager did their best to work arounds your needs. A pleasant experience.
good,"A typical day would consist of meeting my other shift supervisors prior to a shift change just to touch base on goals set for the day. For example, was a clean play done, or were partner breaks taken care of? Good management can definitely set the tone for a store, thus giving us all positive standards to work up to."
good,"The job does not require management to know who you are, so they constantly whiff on recruiting from within. There were five or six students attending business school in my store who were not interviewed for upward placement within the company."
good,I liked working there great place to work it just wasn’t for me. I would recommend that job to anyone. I loved making the drinks and trying all of them
good,It was a nice fun and happy work enviornment. It was my favorite work place and I wish I never had to leave. The management was great and I never had any problems
good,"I have worked at Starbucks for over 4 years and I love my position. I am able to provide quality beveraged and customer service, as well as making connections with customers and staff. I have enjoyed my time with this company!"
good,"Not much to say other than it was a interesting and fun work experience with lots of information to digest and things to do, never a dull moment and always kept on your toes with the constant level of consistency required."
good,"Overall, working here is great. The only down sides are low hour, no advancement and it can be very busy sometimes.  You will get to work in many positions which can be annoy but also fun. You will learn a lot by working at Starbucks."
good,"I prepared and served hot or cold beverages, such as coffee, espresso drinks or teas. I took customer orders and payments, and conveyed them to other employees for preparation. Cleaned or sanitize work areas, utensils, and equipment."
good,I loved going to work and not knowing what to expect. But the lack of communication was the deal breaker for me. The manager I worked for at the end of my time with Starbucks was terrible and I could no longer take it.
good,"I opened a lot, people worked fast and hard. I enjoyed working there. It got hard to wake up early because I had two jobs but I liked the people I worked with."
good,A typical ay at work is stressful but can be fun. When properly staffed the job is great but usually we are understaffed so like kind of sucks during those times.
good,customers and close co-workers were the best part of the job. The task were simple. But the side work and regular cleaning task was a struggle for management to stay on top of it got done when we were at our busiest causing people to be in the way.
good,Just was a great place to work and learn I moved up from barista to supervisor with Just s few months of hard work and dedication. I loved waking up coming to work everyday and dealing with the ppl we come in contact with
good,it instills great customer service in a very fast paced environment. Id recommend it to any student exiting high school. great for college students...
good,Based on my experience for almost 2 years as a partner of that company i have learned so much when it comes on operation like for example i can do multi task without any frustration and they gave me a skills and knowledge that i can equipped in my whole life.
good,"Working there for the time that I did, it was very enjoyable. I had a great manager and she was very flexible with my schedule. I learned how to properly time manage."
good,"My experience at my store in Berkeley, CA was eventful. I loved the job and the work I did but my store was slow and because of that, I didn't receive a lot of hours. So that it why I resigned but I was also only 16 at the time so I understand now they couldn't give me too many hour because I was a minor then. Now I am of age and am ready to come back , so hours will definitely keep me there if I get hired again."
good,It is not the same store for store but a lot if promotions are based on your friendships with management and how well you know the district manager. If your manager is not motivated you will not be helped to move forward either.
good,"Great job for while I was in school deciding what I wanted to do. Generally, stores were very fun to work at. They taught great customer service skills that I use to this day."
good,I loved he fast pace and the atmosphere of the company. I wish the music was controlled b the local workers though. Also I really love what the new benefits for all Starbucks partners!
good,"Enjoyed the coffee, my co-workers, the fun holiday decor, the tips are always great around holiday time, and the socialization you get with the regulars."
good,"Starbucks is a great company that really cares for its workers. They help out a lot with work life balance and have flexible schedules. They're also very understanding when it comes to major life events, such as maternity leave or getting married. The only thing I will say is that the pay isn't that great and management is really hit or miss depending on what store you work at."
good,"Working at an in-store contractor is similar but different from working at  corporate store location.  A partial menu is offered and the payment system are those of the contractor, say Safeway or Kroger."
good,It was fast paced but very calculated so you don't have to think about much. Everything is outlined for you. With a good supervisor everything is brainless.
good,Very supportive corporation with great benefits for employees. My store went through a rough manager transition during a 4 month period which was the most difficult part of the job.
good,"I like the fast paced environment. It was really fun getting to learn how to make all of the drinks. I liked that there was a very specific system being run because it helped things run more efficiently. I wasn't a huge fan of the particular management team, there were a lot of rude supervisors but I enjoyed my coworkers!"
good,"I enjoyed just about every day going into work, great co workers and staff. Management helped you grow instead of micromanage everyday little task. great job"
good,Starbucks offers only part time positions unless you're a store manager. If you work for more than 20 hours a week you qualify for all their benefits.
good,"Starbucks was a fast-paced environment that gave you the proper character to work in a fast-paced workplace in the future. It might get stressful, but the pay is very well."
good,"I worked at a Starbucks to kick off my real career in the medical field.. The one thing I was bummed about was the said they could help pay for school.. But only if you di their schooling.. I want to be a nurse, not work at Starbucks all my life."
good,Tiring but had alot of fun working with a new bunch of staff. Rotating members and rotating customers makes it more interesting. I would say the schedule is a bit overkill but i dont mind it overall.
good,Honestly Starbucks was one of the best employers I had ever been with. The real only garbage part of the job was how awful many of the customers treat you.
good,"I love being a partner at Starbucks, looking for new growth opportunities at this time. I really enjoy the company Mission and Values and culture of how to treat one another!"
good,Starbucks was a wonderful place for me because I enjoyed the culture it surrounds and making drinks. My coworkers were great and I always looked forward to coming to work every day.
good,"A typical day included managing and prioritizing duties--breaks, lunches, positions of staff.  Food Safety is very important and checks and balances for that are strict and may seem like overkill but it is part of the job. "
good,"i also followed my directions and followed my manager's instructions.i also watch out of customers  and think about customer is in charge at that StarBucks, ask my manager to check my my tasks."
good,I would work for this company again in a heartbeat if they would only pay a living wage. Excellent benefits if you are able to make use of them. Unfortunately your experience and an employee can very greatly from store to store.
good,"While I love my job there but a lack of safety for the partners who work their is the only problem. It's a great company with amazing benefits. The District manager treats the employees horribly, They force you take use sick pay when you are assaulted on work property and made to go to the Hospital. The company never assumes responsibility or ownership for their partners. They rather fire and hire 18 year olds and deplete the values and professionalism that is Starbucks. But again this is only in the Hollywood district around central to Union Station."
good,"overall great job , management was a bit confused, coworkers were fun but always problematic.got to learn how to make al kinds of coffee drinks and be creative about it."
good,"This company is a great one. They really take care of their employees and show appreciation. The only down side it's hard to promote in the company. Depending on the manager, you won't be able to promote. I tried promoting three times and my manager wouldn't help me out."
good,I have learned how to deal with some very difficult customers at very peak hours at times. I have also learned how to learn how to memorize different items at a very short time span. Its also has taught me what health inspectors expect when they show up to the job site.
good,"Great place to work, however the lack of career advancement and low compensation made this job unrealistic for a long term career. I would recommend this job for a college student or high school student."
good,Its a job for teens and young adults. The atmosphere is really relaxed. The people that i worked with at that time where childish. But other than that I'd work there again if they paid more.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a fantastic experience. It is fast paced, but you learn so much it really helps you keep up. Its a very education-centric employment. The culture is diverse and inclusive. The hardest part of the job is really just keeping up and the physical demands on you. The best part of the job is easily the coffee!!! But the regulars are amazing as well. It's a team focused environment that really pulls everyone together. I just wished the compensation was better, because all of the other benefits were fantastic."
good,Loved working there is was a fun and enjoyable  environment  plus who doesn’t love coffee most of the people I worked with where very nice. It doesn’t allow enough hours to live on but that’s not why I worked there so it was great
good,Really fun enviroment with coworkers however management could be better awesome benefit and scheduling they really try to make sure the work life balance is there
good,"I enjoyed working for Starbucks. I liked that my input was taken into account and that the work hours were flexable with good benefits. At the time of my employment there were strick rules on uniform and appearance which were somewhat restrictive. "
good,"Quick paced job, not for the faint of heart. Flexible hours. Customers and employees from all walks of life. Good benefits. Don't recommend if you don't like people constantly watching you work. Fun for the most part."
good,I love interacting with customers and the connections we get to make daily.  We stay busy and continue to push each other to be the best we can be.  You become sort of a family when you work in such a great environment.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers. We have such a strong team and we help motivate each other to be the best that we can be. Whenever we are slammed we make the environment fun for everyone, including our customers."
good,"Excelente lugar para crecer profesionalmente "
good,"My daily work, take order and punch it and treat customer politely. I learn how to work in team, how to handle customer complaint and be responsible in workplace. About my management, they are very helpful and polite to me.Between my team, we always work together and help each other in completing our tasks. . The hardest part of my job is I need to faced with different type of people, I need to handle them and be patient.Enjoyable part of my job is when I make my customer as friend and treat them well. They were treat me like friend."
good,"Working at Starbucks is bittersweet and a-little bit of a gamble . It all comes down to your store manager and supervisors. Starbucks is an amazing company to work for you get really good benefits, you're well compensated, and they are very good to there partners. Unfortunately a store is only as productive as its management and when policies are not enforced its easy for such a stressful environment to be derailed into chaos. This Is where you learn to troubleshoot to help get the store in order. Be ready for a high stress environment and a-lot of multitasking. Still this job prepares you for a lot of different settings."
good,"Starbucks was my first real job, I learned a lot about costumer service, dealing with and overcoming challenges, and working as a team with others. I learned a lot about how to interactions with others and learned a lot of patience and understanding for others whether that be customers or co workers."
good,"Your team is what makes it worth it. A good manager and good partners (employees) is what makes it fun.  Without a good team, morale is low and makes the job harder than it should be."
good,It was ok. If you're not a fast learner or have a want to learn about coffee. Then Starbucks is not the place for you. But don't let me discourage you. Apply and you just might fall in love with the company.
good,"It is a very awesome place to work (IF) your just starting off, you dont get full-time hours or barley part-time hours, you just cant live off this job."
good,I loved working at Starbucks because it enabled me to have job flexibility while attended college. I also loved yearly stock opportunities as well as vacation benefits even as a part-time employee.
good,"Fast paced work environment, with constant flexibility required. Influx of orders varies, with customers desires and needs changing with each order. Constantly meeting new people and connecting with regulars and coworkers."
good,This is a typical food service industry job and while it was only waiting table and hosting I was able to develop my customer service skills that eventually enabled me to obtain better customer service related work.
good,"Fun upbeat place to work, great people and benefits. Fun learning to make drinks and it keeps you moving through your entire shift. highly recommend to anyone looking for a good fulltime/partime job!"
good,Little to no opportunities for advancement. Any other Starbucks will allot such things. This is due to the fact that the WTAMU Starbucks is under the Aramark brand and not corprate.
good,"Working at Starbucks was not only a fun place to work, but a great atmosphere for the partners and customers. I was able to meet a lot of great partners as well as customers that became friends."
good,company is very good to employees! Work culture is very focused on working as a team and accomplishing store goals together while also giving each partner independent recognition.
good,"The job is sometimes stressful, and can apply some pressure, but the hours are reasonable and the people are lovely. There is a lot of training required, but as it's mostly team work, the learning can be done on the job."
good,Preparar bebidas a partir de las exigencias de los clientes.
good,"I worked at Starbucks for 4 years and through different locations I have noticed one growing trend: upper management needs to get on the floor. Towards the end of my employment there, there was growing pressure to provide customer service which included being extremely pushy towards customers and their need for a lemon loaf. Working there gave me so many skills, but for one to come to their own at Starbucks they need to be given the chance to get interested in making connections outside of profit. "
good,It depends on your location. My Dm sucks and hired a crook of a manger he believed everything he said. The store was struggling . The Dm left the company and wrote up the wrong people without investigating the manager who was later fired.
good,I love working for this company. I love the partners and adore the customers. The hardest part of the job is working nights for me and the best part is making the customers smile or helping them discover a new coffee flavor.
good,"A lot of fun, time flies quickly. Enjoyed it. Not a lot of room for advancement and pay was what to be expected from fast food. Management alright, but not great."
good,"Very friendly staff. Store manager tries her best to accommodate everyone to the best of her abilities. Some shift managers are amazing at their jobs, others need to use it as a learning experience. Benefits are pretty good for part-time positions. Very flexible for school hours. Must be prepared to work in a fast-pace environment, behind a fairly cramped bar, and be able to treat every customer, no matter how unfriendly, with the utmost respect. Everyone has to rotate positions so everyone cleans, bars, and cashiers."
good,"The job has its ups and downs.  If you have a good location with good customers, then you will likely have a good team or choice of employees to work with.  This makes the job fun and rewarding."
good,Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. The have good benefits for their employees. A free pound of coffee a week and free drinks every shift you work.
good,Absolutely great company to start off your career journey. Tons of growth potential. I don't see many other companies provide such growth opportunities from their entry level positions all the way to management and even head office!
good,This is an ok job. I like working here overall. Starbucks has its own culture that anyone can be a part of. Pay is okay and many advancement opportunities.
good,Work life balance is about a 3 to 3 star but compensation package is really good.  Vacation time up to 4 weeks at 10 years.  Restricted stock units yearly a plus
good,My time at starbucks has been very enjoyable. I was given chances to develop my skills many times. You learn about different cultures and life styles. Most of the managers are supportive and driven. My favorite part of the job is getting to know my fellow partners.
good,Starbucks could make u a better you! The motto is so inspire the human connection using one human one cup one neighborhood at a time. and with that.Your tips will be amazing lol!
good,"long hours standing and running"
good,"Starbucks was a lot of fun to work for. When I first started, my coworker's were the best. The cool thing about it is that you get linlimited free drinks during your shift. Only quarrel I have with Starbucks is the sick day policy and how early you have to work. Regardless, lots of fun, would recommend."
good,"My team is awesome, current leadership, lacks direction and occasionally play favoritism. Exiting assistant, recommended me to be replacement in her absence.  My team lead promised growth in company, asked me to take on more responsibilities, to see if I could grow into assistant position."
good,"You learn a lot and are trained for everything very quickly. However, there is no real time limit for how fast you can advance. Be prepared to be held back from the company."
good,"There is a true place of home. Engaging to the customers and awesome workplace. Many things will be a learning, every day actually. And theres a room for improvement."
good,"Definitely a fun work place but its very hard to get a consistent work schedule! its always all over the place, opening then closing then opening and its hard to schedule life around."
good,I enjoyed my two years at Starbucks. I had the opportunity to become Student Shift Supervisor. I worked at a Starbucks on campus so the work environemtlne was great because we were all around the same age making it easy to motivate other baristas at work.
good,"on a typical day I would work closing shifts after I got out of classes, and I would automatically jump on the bar and make drinks. after a while you get used to the routine of the store. My manager helped me learn to control my stress, and irritability where I do not have it anymore when it comes to stressful situations where everything fly's off my shoulders. The hardest part will be everyone bombarding you at once but you learn to balance everything. I loved my coworkers more than anything."
good,Love the environment had plenty of regular costumers who came in and enjoyed themselves and the drinks that were served. Customers and also coworkers were friendly
good,A typical day at work is super chill and fun. Greeting new and regular customers usually and then taking care of a midday rush that is never too stressful.
good,I love the interactions with the customers especially the regulars. I enjoy a fast paced environment. I enjoy opportunities to float at various locations within my district. There are not very many opportunities for growth within company.There has been a lack of communication between the management and me personally; often specials and new items are released and i have not been explained any information or had a chance to sample which makes it hard for me to give a honest judgement for customers. The fellow baristas are super fun and kind. We all share very healthy boundaries and relationships between each other.
good,"50% on point of sales system"
good,"Working in the morning at my location was a little stressful, super busy both front and drive thru. Working nights was really fun. Tips are good depending on what your location is."
good,"lots of opportunity, easy work good work environment. easy learning and good tips. compensation is average but tips make the difference, flexible schedules"
good,"Working for Starbucks, you will learn so much from the drinks to the customers. It is a face-paced work place. You have to be able to multitask. No slacking. When Starbucks get busy, you have to work as faster and harder. Get people in and out."
good,Love this Company but Management has some serious problems. promised me the world to make me work. Never got promoted to manager. Benefits and paid vacation wheather part time or full time employee. Very fast paced environment. Ability to meet and network with all kinds of people.
good,working at Starbucks has been rewarding I have established great relationships both with customers  in and out of my store . The diverse and uniqueness of healthy relationships of customers and those who have supported and loved me is a great blessing you don't see in a work place and is very rare . i am blessed by my years of work and developed relationships  .
good,it was a great place to work. you pick up a lot of different skills working there. the customers are very friendly and you fall in love with coffee. Great atmosphere.
good,"I absolutely loved working at starbucks. i think it's a great company to work for, and my co-workers really helped me settle in to my new job. It's a ha"
good,"I worked at a Starbucks kiosk in a Safeway so my experience is different than the average Starbucks employee. Safeway implements policies which basically take away all the benefits a normal Starbucks employee receives. For example, no tips, no discounts on products, forced to charge employees for water (but not customers??), minimum wage, etc. Despite that, the job was fun. Customers were nice enough and the shifts weren't too boring. I think working at a Starbucks store rather than a grocery kiosk would have made a big difference."
good,"At Starbucks I have created real and honest connections with customers that I've never experienced in the hospitality industry before. The management tries to adhere to your schedule requests, and food and health safety are a priority. The fellow partners have energy and passion to bring a wonderful experience to the guests. I enjoy the team I work with, and highly recommend Starbucks as a place to work."
good,"A sense of urgency is required. You get free drinks every day that you work and 1 free food item, 1 free bag of coffee per week. If you are a coffee louver this job is for you."
good,"Be prepared to encounter more angry people on a daily basis than you are used to. Also, smaller locations, people expect you to remember their drink order perfectly. It's a fun place, but be ready for early mornings and cranky patrons."
good,Everyday is an opportunity to provide outstanding service and represent a world-class brand. I strive to ensure our customers have an experience that leaves them feeling welcome and appreciated which in turn has allowed our business to grow and prosper even in tough times.
good,"Costumers can be hard just of the fact they are not understanding with new people, and they like their coffee a certain way. But the costumers are do able more than working for a subway or burger king. I like working at starbucks but I do think the mangers could use some more looking into just because not everything fair. I do like working there but it does have its cons."
good,A typical work day at Starbucks at Clemson University on campus Aramark as a barista was extremely hands on at all times basically. I learned that you have to be prepared to get your hands a little dirty and not mind it. The management there was very professional and reliable. The hardest part of the job was the unwillingness of my previous coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers and taste testing the amazing food and beverages we made.
good,One of my favorite things about working at Starbucks has been getting to know people in the neighborhood. Many of them I see every day.
good,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing the facility, as well as overseeing a staff of seven individuals. Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,If you get the right team it can be a really fun place to work. The hardest part of the job is working on the floor and also have lots of computer work to do without it going into your work life balance.
good,"Working at Starbucks says it all.  Job was fun and exciting, management led me to believe that advancement was available. I believe there was no chance to advance."
good,Was very nervous coming on as a barista. All of the multiple drinks and recipes can be very daunting at first. However the training program starbucks has for new baristas works and gets you up to par with your fellow partners in no time. All of the fellow partners are always willing to lend a hand. It was like a second family.
good,"Starbucks is a great job to grow as a worker. You learn how to be social and interact with many people, how to multi-task, about speed, well customer service, etc. A typical day working at Starbucks would be from taking customers orders and getting their names, taking their payments, getting their coffee/tea, and warming their pastries or sandwiches to being on bar making drinks such as lattes, frappuccinos, cappuccinos, etc; in routine and handing them off to the customers with sure satisfaction. There is also the tasks of a store support who make sure the store stays  clean and makes sure all the equipment and things being used throughout the stay remains stocked for the workers to work without running out of anything."
good,Working with Starbucks was a great experience. I learned how to handle very fast pace environment by working the morning rush hour shift. I also learned how to make a mean cup of coffee! The company does their best to keep their partners happy. I would recommend this job to almost anyone!
good,"Its a very busy yet friendly environment. The manager is very understanding and demonstrates leadership very well. My coworkers always work as team teaching me how to become more of a team player. Dealing with people's drinks could become hectic at times with complaints, however customers are understanding and lenient at times."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work. The employees have fun which makes the customers enjoy their experience. Everyone know what they are supposed to be doing and when they are supposed to do it, so it makes everyone's shift easier."
good,"A day working at Starbucks is so much fun it's like you never know what to expect when you walk into work, you meet new people everyday the customers are always nice and welcome"
good,The work place is very fast paced and you quickly have to adapt should one of the baristas call out.  You end up not getting the cleaning done so you can focus on great customer service.
good,"Answer customer calls, assess their needs and complaints and leave the customer satisfied with the resolution at the end of the call. I learned how to better my multi-tasking skills as well as my customer service interactions. The management team is just like your overall supervisor but better, they relate to you and help you with the requirements you need to meet with full understanding, co-workers are non-judgmental and positively friendly, very helpful at most, they will help you resolve an issue if management is not available, teamwork setting in the office, the hardest part of my job is not being able to assist customer's with their needs due to lack of information and unable to invite them back for a better experience because they are in the wrong with the company due to scamming. The part I enjoy the most is talking to a diverse population and learning something new everyday as well as leaving the customer satisfied and hearing that they will do well due to the customer service experience you left them with."
good,"you learn the basics of being a barista and help you learn how to handle a busy coffee rush but if you really want to learn to be a barista, you should apply to a more ""mom and pop"" coffee shop and learn the real art."
good,"i really enjoyed my time with the company and made some amazing friends that I still talk to this today.  overall the job was face paced, fun, upbeat ad positive and the work of course is easy."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a very fun job for me. There is a great work environment and you meet a lot of very interesting people. Memorizing all the menu options was a challenge I quickly mastered.  I worked the bar often due to my ability to work fast. You get two 10 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch in an 8 hour shift. I learned how to casually and politely speak to customers on a daily basis, and multi-tasking is a must."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was Starbucks culture (work-life balance). The core hours are flexible with management. Team members are helpful.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work at specially if it is going to be someones first job!"
good,On any given day I could work with a team of three to four people and take in 100 to 500 customers a day. The best days are the days where we have a full trained team that is willing to work hard to please our customers that we serve.
good,I very much enjoyed my time at Starbucks.  As many days are very busy and fast paced you often learn how to multitask.  Management was easy to work for and always looking for ways to show her employee how much she appreciated them.
good,"Loved starbucks and the customer service skills they provided, pay is way too low, and advancement is like pulling teeth. You will fall in love with the partners, and the culture."
good,"Very fast-paced and very stressful but very fun and enjoyable with the right co-workers. Connecting with the customers has to be the best part of my day, I do become friends with a lot of my customers. I also have never had a more amazing and understanding boss as I do at Starbucks, that alone makes it very hard for me to look for another job."
good,"Uma das melhores empresas que trabalhei, onde aprendi muito, seja com colegas de trabalho ou clientes. Sinto falta da correria sim, por mais massante que era em questão de horários. A empresa é maravilhosa."
good,"I enjoy every moment in Starbucks, making beverages, conversing with customers, and the process of learning new things makes me really happy"
good,The job was great overall but there is a huge difference working for a licenesed store versus and company oporated store. The rules are different and the pay and perks vary. It is easier to move up in a company store versus a licensed store. Also the pay for baristas is very low and should be raised for the amount of work required.
good,"Starbucks is a fun fast paced company to work for, never boring always exciting, can get a little stressful at times but nothing to extreme."
good,Opportunity to work with diverse customers which at times can prove to be challenging. Fast pace work environment. Great co-workers.
good,Very big fan of the company. Allowing the employees to thrive as themselves while still providing an amazing group of people to allow the customers a positive experience. Creating an amazing relationship with regulars was very nice and allowed for a sense of personal relation to where you work
good,"tinhamos duas folgas por semana como que a maioria dos empregos poderia ter, por que 4 folgas no mês é muito pouco para um cidadão descansar por isso que só aceito emprego de seg a sext"
good,una de las mejores empresas donde he laborado con crecimiento laboral y personal los valores que trasmiten son muy buenos un dia normal es muy movido y lleno de nuevos retos.
good,"Oversee all operations of an individual Starbucks.  Coaching, training, hiring and firing of employees.  I set goals for my team to achieve and hold them accountable to those goals.  On am in charge of all HR functions of an individual Starbucks."
good,"I had to perform janitorial duties such as: restock supplies, pull food items and count supplies on hand. morning shifts required setting the store up, restocking milks, steam pitchers, and food to be served later that day. Evening shifts consisted of breaking stations down to clean and sanitize and getting the store ready for close. I learned how to multi-task at an exceedingly fast pace. Management was good for the most part, i had very little differences or disputes with managers that couldn't be resolved with a common understanding being met. I enjoyed working with a team who believed we were in this all together and the only way to make it through would be to count on each other for help and determination. The hardest part of the job was having to say goodbye when I left due to separate career field interest. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to make all the friends that I did and getting to experience the Starbucks way of life."
good,the staff was fun to work with. An amazing work experience..  Great management..    Could use staff transportation.   Better staff discounts.
good,"-Aprendí cosas del café que desconocía"
good,its a good place and community for anybody to work at. highly recommend. been working as a student for two semester and i cant complain at all.
good,"Manager is required to serve customers, support and develop team, grow sales, write schedules, analyze business reports, and maintain cleanliness and food safety standards."
good,"Working for Starbucks was an interesting experience. It was fast pace and very fun. I learned how to take customer orders and ensure that their drinks were made correctly. Not only that, but I learned how to maintain cleanliness in the work force. My co-workers worked well together and we had great team work. The hardest part of the job was learning how to multitask while taking customer orders. Moreover, it was important that orders were made correctly and in a timely fashion. Overall, I enjoyed interacting with customers and making sure they were satisfied."
good,"A typical day at work would start at 4 or 5 am stocking products, preparing register, prepare food items. "
good,"Era uma correria, meu emocional era desequilibrado pelo fato de ser o primeiro emprego. Mas em relação a cultura do estabelecimento é muito bonita de se aprender. Triste mesmo é que os 'PARTINERS' não leva esse lema de lugar agradavel, aconchego aos clientes, nas Starbucks de SJC. Fiquei apenas 3 meses pelo fato de conseguir outro emprego em uma farmacia. Como faço tecnico de quimica, não pensei duas vezes. Alias, trabalhar em shopping não é para mim."
good,If you love coffee and can can keep all the recipes in your head work here. Tips are either great or nonexistant but its still a fun experience.
good,It has been fantastic working with Star Bucks where in i have learned lot of professional and team handling skills and this is the first company where i actually came to know and made myself comfortable with high profile customers.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers. Every customer has an unique quality about them. My co-worker are my family we laugh, we argue but most of all we love what we do. We will always put our customers first."
good,I loved my job at Starbucks but the drama was ridiculous. People complaining to Management over every stupid little thing. If they didnt believe in it they complained. Really frusterating working with 20 immature young women who still live with their parents. I would have stayed if the drama quit.
good,Everyday i would walk in and get greeted by another employee. I learned many customer service skills and to never be afraid to ask questions! The managers were very friendly and helpful and as well were my coworkers. The hardest part of my job was balancing my hours with school since I was still in high school. I have now graduated so that is no longer an issue. My most enjoyable part of the day was seeing the satisfaction of my customers faces as they got their drink and pastry!
good,eithical and a great place to work. provides benefits to part time employees after three months. takes care of employees
good,I am a shift manager for Starbucks. A typical day for me includes a tremendous amount on the spot problem solving. Deploying the employees that are working with me on my shift correctly in order to best run the day. Tracking sales and money goals as well as labor time management. I am in charge of ordering food and supplies for the store as well as trading with other stores in my district. My job includes but is not limited to maintaining a clean store with in all health codes and maintaining all facilities in good repair. Money management and deposits. The hardest part of my day varies depending on the problem but I would say the entire week of Frappuccino Happy Hour.
good,"The day consisted of giving top customer service, making beverages and snacks for customers. "
good,"Overall, Starbucks is job that is often overlooked when it comes to stress and physical demands. While most people think that all you do is push buttons, I've put a lot of time and energy into the last three years. While managing drink accuracy and health code standards, you also have to be personable and willing to listen to multiple people at once. Anticipating what will be desired and the desired service provided is a lot of hard work, which I have found enjoyable overall. At times, the orders pile up, but the challenge is acceptable. The company prides itself on providing a third home to customers as well as making its employees feel comfortable."
good,"A typical day would involve multitasking between various positions within the café. Your team is what makes each day successful and the leadership needs to be on point. Each partner has a task that they are assigned and a secondary task to float to. This allows you to float between positions to help pick up business to keep the ball rolling. "
good,"working hours and working days are very good,i had learned good team leading capacity, managing people, achieved budget ,maintaining all brand standers ."
good,"Starbucks can be a short or a long term position.  They offer flexible hours and benefits. "
good,"I felt that the hiring practices for management needed worked on.  My location was stuck without a manger for three months during the busy holiday season.  We were also promised by our district manager that the new manager would have years of experience working for the company.  When we did get our new manager we found out that she was just hired by the company two months ago."
good,This is a very positive work environment structured by a corporation with clear compassion for their partners as well as their customers. The quality of service and product being distributed is above the curve do to continuos support from management and positive feedback from patrons.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks and build great relationships with the customers and employees. My favorite parts of working there was the freedom to take charge and to get things done, while creating those special relationships with regular and new customers."
good,"Made coffee, chatted with customers, kept the place clean... Worthwhile for all the benefits, though."
good,"I don't have any complaints I love this job and the people I work with,"
good,"No day is the same, Constant changes keeps everyone moving."
good,"I loved the free coffee."
good,Everyday was good day on the job. Having great co workers that were great to be around.Taking care of the animals was something that i loved doing.
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy and a lot of team work was included to finish every single task. I learnt a lot about different beverages, how to deal with customers, I also learnt how to work efficiently. I learnt how to deal with all sorts of customers including customers who weren't satisfied, I learnt how to persuade customers into buying food and beverages. Team work was a very essential part in the job because we would relay on each other for the rapid service that we provided, It was mostly all based on teamwork. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all the orders even when the line would be endlessly long and putting the food into the grills and out in time whilst still taking orders for the drinks. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all kinds of different people together with getting to know your customers and their needs even better. Meeting people from all different kinds of cultures and backgrounds was also something extremely enjoyable."
good,Company that works with your availability and gives you opportunity to grow.
good,I learned great customer service skills and how to multi task in a fast pace work place.
good,"A typical work day consisted of a high volume of customers some with upbeat personalities, fun spirits, big smiles and others just ready to go home. My job was so enjoyable because I got to interact with so many different people from different cultures and backgrounds. I think the most enjoyable thing about my job was meeting the different celebrities and business men and women."
good,I loved working at Starbucks.  The smell of fresh coffee everyday was amazing.  Starbucks culture started to fade away from just coffee when it expanded into food.
good,"At Starbucks, I would typically start at 4:15 in the morning. I would prepare the store to be opened by 5am, carrying out tasks such as organizing and setting up the pastry case and brewing coffee. I then would spend the remainder of my shift serving customers in the drive-thru area. If business slowed, I would continue to keep myself busy by cleaning, organizing, restocking and assisting other coworkers. "
good,"You are always very busy and must work like an octopus with 8 arms flailing around-but that is part of the fun of it."
good,"Starbucks can be a nice place to work. The hours aren't to bad usually, depending on your manager."
good,"Work here was great, the co-workers and shift managers were wonderful. The general manager not so much. I worked 4 hours a week, 8 if I was lucky. I would then get yelled at for forgetting little things after not working for 6 or 7 days in a row."
good,"Working at Starbucks isn't just a job, it's a second home. Connecting with customers daily, and owning the experience is what we do. "
good,Starbucks was my first job back when i was young impressinable and 16. I worked there on and off between college basketball and it really helped me become more outgoing and able to talk with anyone. I loved the benefits and that you could get health care with only 20 hours of work a week. As a shift supervisor you never know what your day would bring and starbucks really empowered us to be able to make the right decisions andmake great memories in customers lives and just daily grind. The hardest part of the job was the very early mornings having to be so awake so fast the best part of thejob was becoming friends with my coworkers and customers.
good,"Great company that tries to give you an equal balance having a life outside of work but has a hard time delivering those expectations. The pay does not correspond with the work load here in NYC however the benefits are great for someone who is getting paid effectively,"
good,"aaaaah Starbuck were many memories made and bizzare storys to tell at home. the job was awesoem, making hot coffee and when theres downtime your able to get to know your regular coffee addicts.  the task inculde cleaning, stocking, sales, and of course making those delcious carmel frappicinos. the co workers are unique and interesting indiviuals. everyboday had different background and the age group was from 16-50. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people and having them pleased with your finely barista skills. the hardest part was just your typical slow dull days. "
good,"Working here took a lot of training but once you get it down, it is a breeze. Great environment. Customers were pleasant here. Hardest part was learning all of the drink combinations but once you learn them all you feel like a know it all.  "
good,"Shifts would last 3-6 hours, usually constantly moving"
good,"Starbucks is a great company, they take care of their employees and it is a fun work environment."
good,Starbucks generally maintains a fast paced work environment. A typical day at work involves excellent customer service and the ability to perform multiple tasks. The partners that I have interacted with have been mostly positive and almost always supportive. The management is fair and straightforward with assignments and expectations.
good,I loved coming into work every day. I loved all my coworkers and mangagement was great. also loved the benefits since I am a Starbucks fiend!
good,Although I had only worked for this company for a short time I enjoyed my time there. GREAT relationships with employees and customers.
good,fast paste
good,co workers are the best.. customers are nice and when we get real busy time goes by fast
good,I've had the best Manager I could possibly have. All the employees are nice and have good work ethics. The customers you grow into knowing.
good,"This restaurant is a high quality breakfast/lunch establishment. The work was hard, but fun. I love being a server, but it did not offer benefits, which I needed."
good,"Benefits are great, and it's very faced paced which I loved."
good,I typical day for me is making and taking orders. Handling money transactions and helping keep everything clean. my co-workers are like famliy and that has to be the best part. Management is helpful and works with you around school and other things becuse they care about you as a person. the hardest part is learning it all but once you get it you wont ever forget it again.
good,"A lot of work, and requires an amazing memory. Building up your ulti tasking abilities. Also builds up patiences, especially when dealing with early mornings."
good,"Great connections with regular customers. Pretty good benefits and flexible hours. I work with other excellent co-worker that were supportive, fun, and friendly."
good,I would come to work an start mt day by greeting my customers. I loved making coffee all the time and loved the smell of it. I learned how to use the espresso machine. My co works we also very helpful. The most enjoyable part was learning how to make all the different kinds of coffee drink's.
good,"StarBucks was the best job I every had I absolutely loved working at StarBucks. It was the worst paying job I every had but I did not care I loved it and if I had not moved away I would have never left, there is so much growth opportunity there is money to be made if you just stick it out."
good,"a typical day at work would be interacting with the many different customers that would come into the store, making coffee, teas, and frapps, joking around and having fun amongst employees... had good interactions with employees. the hardest part of the job was cleaning eveyrthing at the end of the day... the most enjoyable part of my job was my customers... i learne dhow to be organized, how to have great money handling skills, how to be a great employee. the management was great always worked the employees to better convient things for us"
good,"Little responsibility, Enjoyed the face paced and energetic environment. I also enjoyed building new customers. Usually worked alone in Kiosk at Albertson's"
good,Loved being a Batista
good,"To be honest, this was one of the hardest jobs ive ever worked. The hours are crazy and they work you hard. If business is slow they will find you something to scrub. the management sucked in my experience, because they played favorates a lot and it was hard to advance unless you sucked up and had an in with management. The only thing i liked about this job was my co-workers and the free coffee. everything else sucked!"
good,My typical day at work is usually the regular customers that come on a daily and they are all outgoing people. I do also get the new customers and its fun explaining the different varities of drinks and the flavoring.
good,"Responsible for supervising and directing the workforce, making staffing decisions (i.e., hiring, training, evaluating, disciplining, discharging, staffing and scheduling), ensuring customer satisfaction and product quality, managing the store's financial performance, and managing safety and security within the store. Actively managed store employees by regularly conducting performance assessments, providing feedback, and setting challenging goals to improve partner performance. Managed ongoing partner performance using performance management. Became a Classroom Facilitator and a Quality Assurance Ambassador for my district. Obtained the highest Ecosure Score at 97.9% for the state of Michigan."
good,In this place I grown so much. Is a fun work place and they give you the opportunity to grow in the company. They believe in diversity and believe in your potential. The co-workers are great and became part of your life.
good,"though it was stressful at times, everyone was so nice and helpful and they truly made it fun to work the. the most enjoyable part was connecting with the customers and baristas."
good,i enjoyed my job. It was a great place to work and the employee perks were awesome. I still like going there to get a half sweet matcha latte with almond milk
good,"Don’t give up, you will get it! Keep your confidence level high, learn from your mistakes and remember... Your team, coworkers have all been the “new kid”. Overall I believe Starbucks taught me confidence and that I can do anything if I don’t give uo"
good,great job for someone in college or someone who isn't the sole provider of a house hold. great perks as far as extras . it really is a team environment and they encourage it
good,"Starbucks gefiel mir sehr gut, da man dort nach einer kurzen Einarbeitungszeit einen sicheren und für die Branche normal bezahlten Job hat. Durch kleine ""Wettkämpfe"" im Team zum erreichen der Verkaufszahlen wurde durchgehend neues Leben hinzugebracht und es wurde nie langweilig. "
good,The manager of your store will be the person most responsible for how your time at Starbucks proceeds. With a good manager you will be able to achieve any goal you set for yourself. Your partners will come and go and it's up to you to make the most of your experience and be willing to advance.
good,"Loved my job, enjoyed every minute of it. It was really laid back, and great opportunity to work on people skills and Perfection with Drink creation and up-sale."
good,"Starbucks helped engage me into the community simply just by the social environment in which it entails. Communicating and serving to people each day, often being the first face a person may see in the morning and being able to work efficiently but at a fast pace was a great skill I learned working at Starbucks."
good,"It was overall great experience working at Starbucks. Relaxing environment, great people to work with and good on job benefits. It’s good to see people with diverse cultures working together."
good,"Overall a wonderful job, however lost many hours when it slow and when I need hours to pay for school it's very bad for me. Workers and customers are amazing and super super sweet"
good,"Its always a faced pace environment that lets you work with an amazing group of people in a company that truly values their employees. I learned how a company was properly ran to keep people happy and successful. Management is okay, you have a store manager and then a district manager. Hopefully you're lucky to get a good one for either positions but  not everyone gets that lucky. I didn't on either accounts. Other than that its a great company to meet awesome people wether its customers or fellow employees."
good,If you find the right location it is a great place to work. It's not a hard place to work lots of things to learn if you have a good trainer or experience in food service then you'll be fine.ororexpfoservice it's an easy job
good,"Starbucks is a collaborative and inspiring place to work in. Making sure cafe is tidy and clean is a must, so that customers are feel satisfied. Also to connect with customers, so that they fell friendly."
good,Great fun to work at great partners great customers lousy management. so it would appear I have to have a hundred and fifty characters minimum so let me think about this for just a minute I did enjoy working there I did think the managers did not have their employees best interests in mind I felt they were self-serving I do like making frappuccinos but I didn't like my manager she was really self-serving and
good,Great company.  Pay isn't great but the supposed reason is all the benefits.  Would rather just have more money.  Customers can be very rude and company encourages it.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job would be talking with customers. There isn’t anything when you make a customer’s day and they show appreciation. You’ll be surprised what each customer goes through or how their day has been. Letting them know that you actually care, is something I love the most about this job. It’s all about customer connections!"
good,Starbucks is a great place for a student or young professional to start a career. There are advancement opportunities if you stay for many years. Great benefits from other food companies. No complaints!
good,Starbucks as an overall company is great. Eventually the work staff and morale will catch up to the missions and values more than they already commit to in some stores. I am proud to be a partner.
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful complany but i do not have a want to move up in this particular indistry . people are wonderful, customers too most of the time. I am great at defusion tence situation that something come with reatil work, i would love to get into a more creative career"
good,"it is good job , good opportunity to learn new things , management is amazing, I learnt multitasking . positive environment, best place to relax and i enjoy working at Starbucks."
good,Great if it’s a busy fast paced  environment . Better when working in a busy city due to tips great advancement fast and all paid 401k stocks at an insiders discount t
good,Fast paced work environment where one needs to be really active and fast in order to fulfill the customer demands. The thing about working there is that you get so many benefits and the bad is that people talk behind your back.
good,"I like it it here, even though it's not where i feel I'll be for the rest of my life, i'd love to be surprised by that. I do enjoy my time there so far. It is what you make of it too. Culture can be good or bad anywhere and so far I've been able to find the people who have wanted to get to know me and built those relationships which make the work day better so i can work better and keep a good attitude to give to customers."
good,i worked on a campus starbucks so be weary - my manger sucked because she was more concerned with her baby daddy drama then work. i wish we had more training to move up so i could of kicked her out.
good,"I loved working for Starbucks as my first real job, it was very professional with very few or minor problems. I learned to navigate difficult customers with ease but I luckily got to enjoy my work space with some close friends of mine."
good,"Really enjoyed my time here. Was a great place to grow, managers were amazing. Worked hard to make sure that i was treated with respect and alwys had room to grow,"
good,"I love Starbucks! I enjoyed working there in a fast paced customer service environment, and crafting beverages. The employee drinks and meals and free retail item every week was a great perk to the job! I would have liked to receive higher wages. I would love to work there again."
good,Starbucks is a great starter job. They teach you how important being professional is as well as making meaningful connection with the people you work with and all your customers.
good,"Wonderful experience I had. Just be ready for the morning grumps before they had their coffee! "
good,"Best for students. Must being able to stand for long periods of time. Must be able to read, write and speak to customers quickly. Must be able to handle large rushes of people."
good,"Prepare all work stations so they are working properly. I have learned that is always important to focus on customer connections and be able to work in a fast-paced environment. The workplace is a great environment, definitely, a team working environment that helps make it a lot easier to get tasks done for the shift. The hardest part of the job is memorizing all the drinks when you first start working at Starbucks. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to understand that there is more to the job than just focusing on coffee. A lot of it is based on customer connections and being able to enjoy simple conversations with your customers and not just so much on the business aspect standpoint."
good,"I enjoyed working there. The work culture was fast pace and fun. My coworkers were great. However, if you are not good working under pressure, it might not be for you."
good,"Flexible position with lots of good benefits so long as you are working a minimum of 20 hrs/wk to maintain them. It's fun especially around holiday season, but if you are at a busy store it can get overwhelming if you are not used to a fast-paced environment where you are being stared at by customers."
good,I would definitely work there again.It was so much fun. Everyday was a new experience and i loved every minute of it. I can't wait to transfer these skills to another career.
good,"The job is not the most difficult but it is very fast-paced and you are always on your toes whether it's taking someone's order, making a drink or preparing their food, or even restocking; there is never much time to relax. Starbucks is a great company to work for; however, I don't believe baristas are paid enough for what they do especially depending on what store they are employed at. The busier the store the more compensation should be offered. Besides that, the company does offer great benefits and even a schooling option with ASU. The environment is very uplifting and easy-going, and coworkers are fun to work with and get to know."
good,"If you let your emotions get the best of you, then this job is not for you. People will be intentional trying to test your limits of your customer service. The working environment is fun and fine. I myself, never had issues with anybody. It's just the customers that have no sense and are self entitled that will make this job hard. Getting the job is easy but keeping the job is the difficult part. The most enjoyable day is when you have everyone good on shift. The most patience testing is the game days, when the big crowds pop in."
good,"Starbucks offers amazing benefits and incentives for students and recent grads. Also, an automatic raise is given to partners every 6 months! Definitely recommend!"
good,"I loved everything about my job working as a Barista. From the smell of fresh coffee in my clothes, to the happy faces I encountered daily. Also because we worked as a team on the floor, i built great relationships with my co-workers."
good,"Overall, Working At Starbucks Was A Little Challenging And Overwhelming In The Beginning Because You Have To Learn All The Drinks And Keeping Up With The Customer Orders But In The End You Get The Hang Of It And Be So Fluent With The Drinks You Wouldn’t Have Any Problem. Note That You Do Receive Tips At The End Of Your Shift."
good,"It was my favorite job, though the pay was not worth the high stress of working in the mall. I enjoyed the people I met through Starbucks, and how easy it is to transfer to different locations while keeping your job with Starbucks!"
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great way to start off my career, i learned a lot about how to be a supervisor and a great way to have a team focused and prepared for the day."
good,"The customers can be brutal, just don't take any problems too seriously, it's them, not you. "
good,it is a fun work environment but is a little high stress. You receive tips every Tuesday which is nice and the flexibility is also nice to have as well.
good,"When I started working for Starbucks, I really needed a job to get me to college. I had a wonderful time working there, the employees were wonderful and extremely friendly. The work was very heavy… There was a lot of heavy lifting and standing… Which isn’t the greatest when you are a small female.  I love their employee discount, can’t say I was ever tired on the job with all that Caffeine. When I realized I didn’t have enough time to be putting in sparse hours here and there, I realized I needed to quit in order to focus on my studies."
good,"I loved the people i worked with. loved learning about coffee and making customer connections, that i’ll be friends with forever. the people and the craft is what makes this job so great"
good,"Goal is to make customers happy while working in a very fast paced environment. Working well with others is a must in this business. "
good,I worked at Starbucks at a University so there was high traffic. My co-workers and manager were very nice and we all worked well together. The hardest part of the job was scheduling hours for employees to work considering most were students.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work when wanting a fast paced job. It may seem like a lot at the beginning but is a fairly easy once you get the recipes down
good,It is very busy a fast pace store in the heart of downtown Detroit. You meet a lot of good people working downtown tips are great it's a pleasure working there
good,"Starbucks was my first full-time job out of college. It gave me the confidence to a) work as a part of a team, and b) interact with a wide variety of people. I don't think I would have entered the workforce with the same level of skills and confidence as I did had I not worked at Starbucks."
good,"can work on fast faced environment of jobs."
good,"It was a very busy and fast paced location so quite stressful at times but would definitely recommend people to work there. If you have the right team, it was always fun"
good,Ive made so many life long friends here along with a strong connection and relationship with customers. Everyone looked out for eachother and you were never stagnant because there was always something to do. I loved this job.
good,"As a previous partner of 2 years and I can say that it was absolutely a joy to work for this company. Wish I never had to leave but no choice due to medical reasons. "
good,Learned a lot from my time working at Starbucks. Love it. They were flexible around my schedule as I was a single mother at the time. The people are always pretty nice. Management stays on top of things.
good,"I loved working for Starbucks. Unfortunately, I'm deathly allergic to Dragon Fruit and had an unexpected opportunity to arise that I couldn't' pass up around the same time it was apparent I'd no longer be able to work there for my safety."
good,"Being underpaid made me leave Starbucks, but if the pay was worth while, like the job, I’d still be there today. Work day flues by and customer and coworker connections are what made this job special!"
good,"Tasks"
good,You take out trashes and prepare coffee and make drinks. Keeping the store really clean as well as keeping everything stocked for everyone you work with. The hardest part of the job is the amount of hours you are on your feet for.  The most enjoyable part is being able to drink as much coffee as you want.
good,I absolutely loved working at Starbucks and what the company is about as a whole. It's a perfect first job that teaches you great skills. Very beneficial.
good,My overall experience with Starbucks was chill I really loved the job and the people and the environment would do it all over again unfortunately I had to relocate I do recommend it to any and everyone great experience
good,"You can get amazing benefits working for this job, however it's not guaranteed that you'll make it through the probationary period. If management doesn't like you they won't help you process the paperwork to invent a Starbucks drink. Was hard making it long enough to actually see benefits coming my way. Other than that, it's meant to be a great opportunity. Great for students."
good,"Starbucks is a great stepping stone company. You learn how to multitask, communicate, provide great customer service, etc. There are also good benefits, even for part-time employees. If you are lucky, your coworkers will always keep the jokes and jovial atmosphere coming."
good,"Highly recommend for energetic, multi-tasked persons. This was my best job ever. It is a really cool place to start if you are going to school. Very flexible."
good,all you really have to do is make coffee and other drinks and fast. If you do that you will be just fine. It wasn't hard at all but you have to cater to people before they have their coffee... so that can be annoying.
good,Sometimes there are times where there is a rush of customers that come in and I can be come overwhelming.. sometimes you have some coworkers that make things more difficult than they need to be. As long as your doing your job the correct way you should be okay.
good,"Maybe it was just my location but i genuinely liked my job, and would happily have stayed, if there was opportunity to move up in my area, or the pay/hours were there."
good,"I loved working for Starbucks, I met amazing people there and loved interacting with customers. I just wish the pay was better and that their were more benefit options that fit employees needs."
good,"They a very good company , you wouldn't have any issue with getting alone with the coworkers..you will adapt fast .if you people person this the job for you, interavting with customers. An explainibg different types of coffees an factually. You show g the customers that you have knowledge about it an kan tell the difference with certain smells.."
good,"Great as a ""while you finish school"" job. I enjoyed the flexibility in scheduling that allowed me the opportunity to finish my first year of college. Grateful for the structure it gave me as well."
good,"I worked at an underemployed starbucks that could just never seem to actually stick to getting employees. Got called in a lot, which i wouldn’t complain except i’m a student and i got taken advantage of a lot for being so easy going and accepting of the hours"
good,"at first it was great, but the manager I had didn't care about anything near the end.  Other than that, great place to work. would recommend that people work here"
good,"Its cool place to work and learn... it's a great culture... enjoy smell of coffee,  taste of coffee. spread love and smile . Its  supper fast pase . Enjoy everything under one roof."
good,"Great experience, worked with amazing people!!!! Had a fantastic client base.  Training and expectation are made clear at training and reinforced with great management team"
good,"Hay un buen ambiente laboral, trabajo en equipo, excelentes persona, horario flexible para tomar nuestros estudios pero los horarios de cierre no acaban a su hora. El equipo de gerencia son lideres, saben como comunicarse con los partner, hay apoyo en todo sentido."
good,"Es emocionante vivir el hecho de cómo detrás de una barra de café se puede congeniar con tantas personas con diferente humor, maneras de hablar e historias que contar."
good,"I love working for Starbucks, and dont want to leave. The management is great. I love the people I work with. I love connecting with customers when I make their drinks. I need a first shift job with a little bit more money then I get paid now otherwise I would definitely be happy where I'm at."
good,I loved working at Starbucks but I hated manager she was very mean to me.  I couldn’t take being bullied so I had to leave. I wasn’t going to let her bully me anymore.
good,"A typical day is hardwork but can be fun. You get to connect and meet with a variety of customers who turn out to be regulars. "
good,The company helps you grow a lot. It it harder work than it looks.  they put their baristas and customers before any other partner.  Benefits keep getting better.
good,Starbucks is a great company and anyone interested in food service and loves coffee should go there. they offer friendly service and a great way to enhance your customer service capabilities.
good,"Es el mejor lugar para trabajar, te enseñan a catar café!"
good,"While the company is great and does provide good benefits considering how easy it is, it really all depends on where you're hired. There are all sorts of managers and if you get a poor pick you won't be able to move up in said company."
good,"Great environment. Stressful during peak, but manageable. I was injured, that is the only reason why I had to leave. Understanding manager, and the company was willing to work with schedule issues."
good,"Good place to work, but not enough hours."
good,"Wonderful place to work, but depending on location its very hard to move up. Very fast paced; not recommended for those who are easily overwhelmed or prone to anxiety. This company provides amazing benefits and that's what keeps me after all this time."
good,"The management depended on the location, the culture was good overall. The hardest part was the different work ethics because it is a part time job. Everyone got paid the same but not everyone did the same amount of work."
good,I would say the hardest part is customer service and how to explain how drinks or food is made. Sometime it can get stressful if u don’t have enough employees working that day or it’s jsut a busy day
good,"I should have never left Starbucks and I'm even considering going back. For my location it happens to be very busy- so busy in fact it it's hellish and stressful but I found my manager agreeable and flexible with my hours, my time off and etc. That isn't every store however- some have horrible management and can be a dead store with a small rush here and there. So my rating is pretty bias. I felt like it was pretty great seeing regulars, co workers, and first time customer have fun in between the chaos and no matter how chaotic my location could be there was always a positive connection. There have been off days with a customer throwing food back you but that was a rare and to be honest wasnt the reason of leaving"
good,"This job was very fast-paced,  I liked the flow though, there was never a dull moment. I liked the versatility in hours as well, we were allowed to switch shifts and stuff. The tips were ok, but the biggest con would just be a competitive nature and some gossiping/ drama among the teens/girls."
good,The only drawback was having to wake up at 3:30am to open the store. The team environment is stupendous and working there for 4 years made me a better person - will probably always be my favorite job.
good,I would work a lot and my boss was intending to promote me and promised me she would within the month. She then Continued this lie for 3 more months even after i told her that i would find another job if she didnt follow through with the promotion after the 3rd month. Everyone else was awesome and I'll never regret working
good,I love working for Starbucks ! This was my first job ever and I am so happy it was.starbucks taught me professionalism.i would absolutely go back tot his job .
good,"hello "
good,"I would highly recommend this job to anyone. Working at Starbucks was the highlight post graduating from my BA. It's fast paced, supportive, and secure environment make it the best option for anyone looking for work."
good,Great team members friendly environment and overall a great work experience. The training was great and descriptive and the benefits are like no other job
good,"Such a great environment to be in, everyone was so friendly amd outgoing and so open minded, our regular customers were the best as well! Such a good company!"
good,"A typical day is pleasant, but non-stop busy! The manager is nice but is not encouraging and drives the store based on his mood. However, most shifts are great. My co-workers and shift managers make working there really enjoyable. I will stick around!"
good,"There is always room to grow at Starbucks, depending on location. When sought out, there are many opportunities to learn more about the company and what it takes to grow. Like any job, the manager that is enforcing the correct policies is what it takes for the store to strive. When the manager isn't too personally involved, it makes it run more smoothly."
good,Difficult but rewarding work. Really helps bond coworkers together to tackle hard fast tasks. upward mobility is available for anyone who is willing to push themselves forward in a career. Wonderful benefits and environment to work in.
good,"Ben barista olarak çalıştım. haftalık 45 saat çalışma süresi var."
good,My typical day was full of amazing encounters with individuals from all walks of life to encounters that were less than desirable. My manager was amazing and really tried his best to work with the crew. The culture was very free and welcoming of everyone. I miss the people that would stop by and see us and remind us that people do value what we do for them.
good,"Buen trabajo, la pasas muy bien, se adaptan a tus horarios de escuela"
good,"really busy al the time, specially summers, and mornings through the year. Manly young people and a lot of energetic people. "
good,"I loved making drinks for everyone and always looked forward to getting the new drinks and trying them. I loved how fast paced it was, and it kept us all on our toes. I just didn't like the management, they were never around and didn't care what we did...which made everyone kind of not care either, which made working there hard. I felt I was the only one who cared about my job."
good,I loved working there. Work hours were good and balanced with life. Gets pretty busy in the mornings n evenings so gotta be fast paced. I would recommend to anyone that needs a summer job or wants to work part time.
good,It was a great part-time job while in school. I got the hours I wanted for the most part but I transferred stores when I graduated and the new store culture was horrible. It was an unfortunate end to my employment with Starbucks.
good,"At the few places i have worked and have heard other people work it is by far the most helpful, accommodating, and understanding company one could ever work for."
good,Starbucks is amazing to work for but at my current location with my current manager there are a few issues with not understanding the volume of customers and how to care for them.
good,I was employed with Starbucks for a year and some odd months but i maintained my rent and maintained a great relationship with the company and really valued the options they had for partners going through any hardship. It was one of the first companies I Actually enjoyed working with.
good,I really loved my store manager when I worked at the location in Phoenix. The Starbucks owned by HMS Host was a little different than what I was accustomed to. I worked at one that had a drive-thru but HMS Host was in the airport so it was slightly busier.
good,"Great job for part time work. Good for students, or those in need of extra income. Available hours vary on sales. Must be able to deal with stressful situations and be able to offer solutions to a wide array of problems or conflicts that may arise in a service job setting."
good,I loved the job it was a fun and great first job. They are very understanding and compensating on any topic. The job gives great opportunities and treats patrons and employees great.
good,Good management. Free lunch. Free coffee. Free school. Good values. Good health care options. Good job for students. Not a bad place over all. Easy training
good,"It was great while it lasted.  It was never a career for me, just a temporary job.  I would recommend it to anyone in high school or college as it has great flexibility."
good,"Starbuck's taught me a lot on how to make coffee, patience with customers, and strong leadership skills to keep you motivated. I highly recommend Starbuck's if you looking for something that will hire fast if all circumstances are met."
good,"An average day of starbucks would be coming to work and punching in, putting on the green apron and going on the floor.  you get greeted by everyone your working with and get told to go to the position they need you to be in, either on till or bar."
good,Can be hard when living a busy life but depends on managment and team. Team effort and close partnership with management is needed to ensure the job runs well.
good,"Typical day at Starbucks would start off with wearing the appropriate work gear. Consult with the on-site Supervisor to know which position you will be in charge of. Then relieve the co-worker from the previous shift. I loved working in my own space and having control of my drinks. The hardest part of working there would be when the rush happened at the same time as our equipment went down. I loved being in control, but whenever the equipment shut down when I needed it the most, it really created stress for me. But I learned how to make things work, and adjusted to the every day struggles."
good,"Starbucks is very essential. Here are three major reasons why I believe so. We provide free cups of Ice , water, & free WiFi. We have great treats and great Expresso."
good,Typical days are rather busy with random lulls in business. Management is rather on top of their duties and does a good job scheduling breaks. The most enjoyable part of the job is the free drinks and coffee. The hardest part of the job is learning all the drinks.
good,"I loved working with my co-workers and management team here at Starbucks! A typical work day would look like, getting everything ready for example the lobby, pastries, machines, outdoor patio, and bathrooms."
good,"buen ritmo de trabajo, ambiente agradable, buen trato entre pares"
good,"My coworkers were great, the pay wasn't anything to write home about."
good,A typical morning at Starbucks was very busy and involved positioning all employees into their roles during the busiest times. The hardest part of the job was communicating with others. The culture and atmosphere made for an enjoyable experience and great relationships made with fellow employees.
good,"Fun, definitely quick paced. Great environment to meet new people and to be creative and think outside the box. I would recommend anyone seeking a job at Starbucks to ask anything they don’t understand, and have lots of patience."
good,"Very busy, always moving, customer service, it's easy to move up to shift supervisor, but after that it's a constant battle."
good,Great work environment and great customers. Good place to work for anyone with good people skills.the benefits are good and their training is very thorough.
good,This company can be good and bad as they are a corporation so their decisions are political. But they compensate their employees and are great if you need time off or to take a leave of absense
good,"Safe place to be, Great customer service, Managers are a hit or miss. Seems like some of them have a favoritism Mentality. That needs fixing :D Over all Great place"
good,The culture and environment of working at Starbucks was one in which I felt that I learned a lot about patience and how to deal with customers . Great experience.
good,"I learned that working as a team in a workplace is not only fun and exciting. But it gives you a sense of how important it is for one company to work as a whole even though different workers take on different work task. If everyone is doing what they are supposed to do, together we provide excellent customer service. Each customer is ordering, collecting, and paying in a timely manner."
good,"Aprendí a hacer más rápido, conocer sobre la importancia de que el cliente se sienta cómodo y satisfecho en lo que consume y lugar de estadía."
good,"Very fast paced environment that can be stressful. being able to handle many customers at once, maintain a clean work place and completing tasks in front of you are the main characteristics you need."
good,"When you have the right team it's easy to come to work and that's how it was for me when I worked at Starbucks. They made the environment fun and welcoming and also comfortable. I learned so much about teamwork, leadership and of course coffee while I worked here. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how your compliment or even just the drink you made a customer could lighten up their day so much. The hardest part was the time I had to wake up at in order to open the store properly."
good,I didn't  get enough hours to be able to survive on this job. I loved working here though. If money wasn't an issue for me I'd definitely love to go back to work here.
good,Although it is a very fast paced job I enjoy making new connections with the customers. I guess you can say its what keeps me going. Every person who walks in has a different story to tell and even the ones who don't I really enjoy trying my hardest brightening up their day through my job.
good,It was really nice working at Starbucks. They have an great atmosphere. I would think of it as a “relaxed” job but still very productive. They hourly pay wage is also great.
good,Starbucks is one of the most rewarding places to work.  You are constantly challenged and constantly multi-tasking. Very rare to ever become bored while at work.  Engaging with customers is the most fun of the job.
good,"These jobs provided me a very good intro to the ""work world"" and being involved in customer service. It taught me a lot how t interact with people and keep your co-workers happy."
good,"Was a great place to work but had it limits for advancement."
good,"a fast paced great place to work , room for growth . great staff and trainers . great products and brands."
good,"Starbucks was my first job and I couldn't have been happier with another! I worked in a wonderful environment. I had some exceptional coworkers and my management team was always understanding and would go out of their way to make sure that no only their customers were taken care of but their team members as well. Although it was sure a wonderful job I was not paid enough in anyway. I would LOVE to work at Starbucks again (if only there were more hours in the day). If you are someone that has another person that you can depend on to help pay bills, cost of living and such or if you are just looking for a second/part time job, I 12/10 recommend working for Starbucks!!"
good,It’s a very fun and friendly job but sometimes it could be hard depending on the store. You have to be good at communication and costumer service And teamwork
good,"You have to work hard and be committed, but the work itself is not challenging. Most of the work associated with this position is social in nature, and requires good relations with your coworkers and customers in close contact for long periods of time."
good,"Learned a new skill which is an asset. My General Manager was the best, but the new heads of staff is still in training. It will take time for it to build the staff needed, but overall all a  very great experience."
good,Positive environment to work. Great team. Good people. Great staff. Love making all the different types of drinks. Making Frappuccino’s was my favorite!... Learned a lot
good,Starbucks main focus is to always be around the customers. Constantly striving for strong customer connections between partners and customers. They always look to make the moment right.
good,"Responsible for maintaining a clean, safe, and organized work environment for employees and customers in a timely manner."
good,"Expect to have different positions during your 7 to 8 hour shift. There will be very little downtime and your shift will go by fast. You will need to manage many channels of beverage/food orders. Prepare to collaborate and communicate - a lot - with your co-workers to ensure a positive experience for all partners on the floor. In general, the beverage recipes are essentially the same in terms of pumps based on cup sizes and/or hot/iced preference. Learning how to make the drinks can be challenging now with the label system. Bar partners have to label their own drinks. When I last worked at Starbucks, I worked at a store that still hand wrote the beverage orders and I found learning the bar beverage making to be easier when the cashiers labeled the drinks. Another job element to learn is how partners are deployed on the floor. The deployments of staff constantly changes based on time of day. In regards to deployment, just ask questions and do your best to remember what each floor position is able to do. "
good,"great place to work being a college student "
good,"Not an easy job, but the managers tend to take good care of their employees. However, it was a standard food service job (when I worked there) in that you don't get paid time off, even if you work full time."
good,"Lo que mas me gusta de la promociones es que te diviertes dando a conocer el producto al publico, a la vez que interactúas con el, porque ellos están interesados, en probar y saber del producto"
good,Starbucks is a good first job. It helps grow and advance the 'adult' lifestyle by helping manage time and priorities. Wonderful staff and management and some room for advancement.
good,"The workplace was a very collaborative and friendly environment to work with. I enjoyed meeting and talking to a lot of different people, coworkers and customers."
good,This job is good if you are looking for a side job whilst studying and the pay is good as it gives everyone equal pay. It also has many benefits that you can enjoy when you are in the company
good,"I typically opened at my location at 3:30am and ended my shift at 9:00-9:30am. Once a week I did stocking for the store, other than that I was typically on the register. Occasionally if I asked I'd be placed elsewhere, only due to the time I worked. Co-Workers were great, everybody has personality. Hardest part of the job was the occasional ""This drink was made wrong, I want a refund!""  or people getting upset in the drive through."
good,Most people I worked with overall were friendly. Making drinks was a great way to keep busy. I enjoyed talking with the customers and overall I enjoyed my time there.
good,It was a very easy going but busy place to work. An average day we would have a rush then it'd slow down then another rush. I really enjoyed being a partner at Starbucks
good,A typical day at work is made up of following store and company policies and carrying out every single task when assigned too. Free lunch and drinks when ever you're on the clock.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is usually mostly busy. A lot of standing, A lot of customer interactions and cash handling. Management for the most are pretty good at what they do. The hardest part of my job is the standing for long hours. And the most enjoyable part is making a customers day brighter by making their drinks correctly or just showing them a nice gesture."
good,Working for Starbucks has been a great experience.  My time with the company has been beneficial to me on both a personal and professional level.  The company has offered great benefits for me and my family.
good,"I've been working here since I came to college as a freshman. Started as a barista and within a year I was a supervisor. I have had an excellent time working here, made some neat friends, and the company works around my school schedule."
good,"I have been with Starbucks for 5 years and this company is one that I believe in and can get behind. My only complaint is that the working experience in each store is highly dependent on the store manager in charge. If the manager is not up to par or willing to take our goals and mission statement seriously, it can break the team."
good,Its a good company but the experience will vary based on the location. The different managers and the baristas they employ will create fairly different personalities. In my experience they will be able to find a place for anyone who is a good person somewhere.
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for. It's benefits are amazing for schooling, health care and stock options. However the compensation for the hourly work is lacking. All in all Starbucks is a wonderful company full of wonderful people and amazing management. The atmosphere of working at a Starbucks is incredible and always welcome to new or returning baristas."
good,"Excelente lugar para trabajar, que te enseña a trabajar bajo presión, a tener mayor contacto con las personas, así como la obtención de otras competencias en parte básicas que se pueden obtener siendo tu primer empleo."
good,"I love working for Starbucks Coffee Company. Looking for an opportunity for growth to upper management; which isn't currently available for me. My favorite part of my job is the investment I get to make in my team, daily."
good,"Starbucks has a great. Discount they work with your hours you get to have fun all day, they hire great people whom are easy to work with. Be prepared for a fast pase job, its very hands on and you will be on your feet all day and must be able to multi task and think fast with a great memory."
good,"Manage all daily operations, including: ordering daily and weekly inventory; ensuring clean/safe readiness in accordance with Starbucks systems; supervising twenty partners and four assistant managers; forecasting and scheduling partners shifts; doing payroll; setting up weekly and seasonal promotions"
good,"Starbucks was a good place to work,  but the pay didn't match with the work having to be done there, just to be honest, but the benefits were amazing!"
good,"the company's core and business practices made me proud to work for them.  as with any company, as you get down to the day to day activity, you would not always have the best managers.  This would be especially true if they were unorganized."
good,"Good place to start as a first job, training was thorough and co workers were extremely nice! Great benefits after 6 months. You learn a lot of new skills"
good,Management could be a little better they way they handle things An that starts at the top An also making sure to keep store nice well neat an clean an keep sales an business up an going promte more as a store
good,Depends at which location you work and if it's a drive thru some days are very fast pace especially with the peak hours. Everyone must work as a team in order for it to flow smoothly. My favorite part of the job is creating customer connections and seeing customers leave happy and satisfied.
good,Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for when you’re working for the right location. Unfortunately where I worked I had three different managers and was promised a position i never received but as far as management goes that is something they can definitely work on.
good,"Working at Starbucks gave me the opportunities to meet new people, practice customer service, and learn time management. "
good,"I got a job at Starbucks 3 months after I graduated because I needed to begin earning some income while I still waited for the first career job. The people were awesome to work with and I made many friends. The only thing was my managers were crazy. I had one manager that was going through a mid-life crisis where she literally left during her shift when we were busy. She was awful, but that did not ruin my perception of Starbucks."
good,I learned a lot at Starbucks including perfecting my multitasking skills and customer service skills. Starbucks also helped teach me how to manage others.
good,"we were the leading store in the district, always busy from open to close there was always a line. customers were generally friendly and management was workable."
good,I loved working at starbucks the job itself was just so entertaining. Teamwork is always in motion. From learning new drinks to creating a customers specific drink. It’s all about our customers and there satisfaction.
good,This is a very family oriented and pet friendly place to work. You got mark outs every month and everyday you get a free beverage and free meal anything else purchased gets a discount.
good,"Always remember that you're in customer service. There are cases where you will have to choose between the fairly strict company policy and ""making it right for the customer"". I would advise doing right by the customer nearly every time."
good,Starbucks was a good place to work especially to gain customer service and cashiering experience. It also shows you how to effectively work in a fast paste industry. Starbucks will prepare you for any customer service/ cashering job
good,Starbucks is very easy to get started as an entry-level job for anyone that doesn't have a direction. You will find the most amazing people guiding you through Starbucks.
good,9/10 would recommend to work here. Great for people who catch on quick. Easy to establish meaningful relationships with regulars. Fun to make different kinds of drinks. Bonus three free drinks each shift.
good,"Just like any other customer service position, working here involves dealing with a lot of rude entitled customers but it is nicely balance with your regular customers that you end up forming very close bonds with."
good,A typical day at work was quite stressful but also quite rewarding. The staff was very welcoming and always helped new employees learn and grow in their position. There was also room for applying to higher management positions.
good,Working at Starbucks was a fun experience. Being a barista was fun because I was able to learn how to make all the drinks that Starbucks had to offer to their customers. I was also able to create relationships with customers that were regulars. The environment was fun and teamwork based when it was during peak hours.
good,"Starbucks is not a job for the sensitive, the customers are mostly mean, and the job is very demanding. Its super fun if you can get over those things."
good,The Starbucks I work on is not a corporate store and is very fast passed and busy since it is on a college campus. The co-workers are friendly and very helpful. Training takes about 3 months but is very helpful.
good,"Enjoyed working there. It was fun when it lasted. The customers and coworkers where a lot of fun, everyone was a joy. I learned about time management better working here, the hardest part would have had to be the morning rush. Always beating the times."
good,"Good job to put you through school, but not beneficial long term. Starbucks is a very good company to work for. It teaches you a lot about customer interactions and helps to shape young professionals."
good,"World class customer service, Learn how to overcome new challenges every day."
good,"My location needs better district managment, plus this has caused my wife and I to be unhirable while others that quit after us have gladly been awarded a job."
good,Great management but the stress level can become exhausting. I love working with most of my coworkers but the low pay just isn’t meeting my needs. It’s also hard to get paid more and still get enough hours.
good,Love working here just dont enough to live off at 5hja job I wasnt able to ever pay my rent cause my hours would get cut alot because of new people which meant I didnt get to pay the needs I needed
good,"Seeing regular customers you know by name and making drinks. Great company overall. will recommend. Will work again. Great benefits , great people. Management could be better but partners are life. I really enjoyed the experience."
good,Fun Environment meet a lot of cool people plus benefits are pretty good. Learning about coffee culture and the different types of coffee their is. Plus free drinks
good,"Great company to work for, depending on management at the time.again, the company was great though and offered benefits even to part time employees. Discounts were also good."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks, getting to know customers and interact with them was nice, specially regulars. You will learn basic skills to get you started for any other job you wish to proceed with. The company also allows for promotion. You could start as a barista and possibly one day work for corporate! I definitely recommend as a starter job."
good,"It was ok to work with different kind of ethnicity. It was fine working with them, but sometimes stressful to because we have different kind of personality."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. As far goes benefits, they really take care of their work force. In the end, your excitement at the job will depend heavily on the culture of your store. If your coworkers are reliable with getting up on time (usually opening shift is 5am) then you won’t have much issue. Also the staff tends to get crabby with eachother  at most Starbucks but like me it’s best to just stay out of it and mind your business. Admvamcement is really 70% seniority and 30% skill set. And depending on your store, you may have to deal with insane rush hours. My store had 4 designated rush times. It was craziest on a Friday but overall, you realize that this job is just that; A job. And you WILL most likely end up doing something else."
good,"unfortunately my reason for leaving is the lack of challenge and repetitive job that the ""fast food"" industry provides. it's honestly a great first job maybe even a job to help get you through college but it is definitely not meant for someone who enjoys change."
good,Working at starbucks was a blast! I had a lot of fun and really valued the experience when it came to preparing highly specialized products in extremely high-stress and fast-paced environments
good,The benefits are amazing through Starbucks especially because they offer medical and dental for their part time employees. The managers are either hit or miss. Very busy work environment and can be high stress at some times.
good,The company and benefits are fantastic. Unfortunately we had a new district manager who does not follow mission and values unless her boss is around. I watched 4 managers thst I work with either demote or resign. So sad but again do not let this represent the amazing company. They actually care about their employees and offer them alot!
good,"Working at my store is really fun, we have a great team and we all support each other any way possible. I've been at my current store for about six months and we all work well together. We are a really busy store and at times it is hard on my team when it comes to bar and food request but we have outstanding communication with the entire team and also include our customers in what is going on. Time management and prioritizing is huge here and being able to continuously move is all you need to work here. Also a great sense of humor and attention to detail especially when it comes to beverages with multiple customizations."
good,The cash register is very easy to manage and making drink was very fun and fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work the energy is great the work is easy and the pay is even better. The benefits is the best part but you will never feel like it’s a job.
good,"Working at Starbucks was a change for the better in my life, it helped with my growth as a person and an employee. This job brings to the table amazing benifts as well"
good,Great environment.  Opportunity for advancement.  Daily goals and team recognition. Offered a variety of duties not stagnant.  Great 401k with stock options
good,I enjoyed working with Starbucks due to the fast paced environment however I couldn’t stay because of the demand and me continuing my education. I would recommend others to work here.
good,I loved my job at Starbucks just wish upper management was more caring of the work place. I would love to work at Starbucks forever and would recommend Starbucks to anyone for a job
good,"Working for starbucks was fantastic, I learned a lot of customer service skills the management was great and the job was very enjoyable. the customer were friendly and my co-workers were very motivating. there is a chance for great progression and the pay was good for a first job"
good,busy times during the day but overall not a difficult job. The most difficult part would be dealing with angry customers or shortness of staff during a busy time
good,"good place to work.  flexible schedule, discounts were great.  management left much to desired but that was the only complaint.  our manager was late often, and never wanted to deal with any issues in our store which left the rest of the employees struggling for authority."
good,"I loved learning about all of  the different  origins and countries Starbucks harvest's their coffee beans. Learning and Understanding the precise flavors was a vital key in helping the customers of whom were also learning how to distinguish their coffee palate."
good,"Was a good job but I did not feel like I was going anywhere ..or receiving anymore then what I had been receiving. I worked full time, almost 7 days a week , and was also care taking for my grand mother part time. So I was pretty tired every day but I still managed to show up on time and rarely called out sick.i learned quick and made delicious beverages. My customer service was on point, and customers were satisfied with me always. Was a very fun job until towards the end, we had a new person from a different location come in to manage. Everything change dramatically, and I no longer enjoyed working there. Co workers became extremely clicky."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for 3 years, and I loved it! Very fast-paced environment, unlimited free drinks while you work, employee discounts, and great hours that work around your school schedule. I would absolutely recommend this job to students who are just joining the work force and need experience in the customer service field."
good,"Overall, this is the ideal first job. It is a fun place to work and a great company to work for. You get the opportunity to meet fantastic people because they become your regulars and you can learn their names, their orders and create a very welcoming environment. Management is different where ever you go. Some occasions, you will get an amazing manager who puts out schedules weeks in advance to ensure their employees know what they are working and can plan accordingly, and other times, it will be Sunday and you will be struggling to know what you work the next day and into that next week."
good,"Everyday at Starbucks is different but very similar. Strongly based on customers, some days are very fast-paced and others are not so busy. Making drinks was the most enjoyable part of my job, but was also the hardest because remembering drink recipes and changes is sometimes difficult. My co-workers were also a very enjoyable part of the job, always made shifts fun and interesting."
good,"was able to gain customer service, and a lot of patience working here. the hours were pretty good but got very overwhelming at times. would definitely recommend this job to someone going to school"
good,"- fast paced environment, lots of drinks and customers"
good,"It’s an awesome place to work. You will need to find a good manager to work under and a understanding shift supervisor. It’s extremely stressful and business oriented, be prepared to work hard."
good,"Making drinks, serving customers, cleaning, were all apart of my duties which was generally easy. It could be fast paced sometimes which was also good too. It was a good part time job to have while enrolled in High School."
good,"The pace can get crazy in the morning, but the company provides a lot of benefits for only working 20 hours a week. Your experience can greatly differ based on who is running the store you work with and the supervisors you directly serve under. It's been a great experience that has helped me create a great foundation for building my career."
good,"Enjoyed it, had a great time working with the other employees there. Working at Starbucks was fun and also fast you had to keep up the paste, everyone there was so nice and kind! Customers were also very understanding and kind."
good,"Great management, people were fun to work with. Quick paced, constant movement. Pay was decent but not for the hours they had me working. I would recommend it."
good,"Starbucks was my first real job, and it was very fun until I wanted to move up which was hard. But learning the drinks, and working with my coworkers was fun and easy"
good,I liked it but my manager was a b*tch. I spoke up to the general manager about her and so did many of my coworkers but no action was ever taken. They allowed us to get bullied by that horrible manager and eventually I ended up quitting.
good,"I was a barista at Starbucks. As many Starbucks location, the place I worked at served hundreds of customers a day. Job itself is fast paced, not just because of the volume of customers, but also the things that must be done for sanitation purposes. Overall, it was a good experience."
good,"Muy buen lugar para trabajar, que ofrece crecimiento y además permite conocer y promover la cultura del café. "
good,"Very good training program.  Taught employees about the history of the company and about the various coffee (drinks) available and how each is made.  The customers were the most enjoyable part of the job, as well as many of the employees who knew how to function as a team!  Hardest part was the opening shift starting at 4:30 am!!!  First manager I had was totally awesome and worked as hard as her employees, the 2nd manager, not so much."
good,Its great for the retirement and healthcare benefits.Its terrible for the pay. You get many breaks. Its the easiest job ive ever had. the environment is chill.
good,"I was only trained for three days prior to being a barista. Consequently, what I learned was mostly done on the floor. Management was very unnecessarily micromanaging, condescending, and overall unfriendly. The job is very fast-paced and you must learn many recipes and how to do them quickly and without mistakes. Can be extremely overwhelming at times. Many baristas cry from stress. There are many facets of this job, as Baristas must do several different roles while on shift. Perks include discounts, free drinks on shift, and flexible hours."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for."
good,I will never stop working at starbucks because everyone who leaves comes back. It's a great company to work part for but if you're looking to advance the political and social constructs get in the way. Part time job with great benefits. Customers are extremely entitled and rude often. Make connections with customers and fellow partners to make this job a little bit more fun and rewarding.
good,Starbucks is a very wonderful place to work for a young adult. The work culture at Starbucks has been the moist interesting over any job I have had. The management was very kind and helpful as well. They tend to make you feel like some sort of parental figure.
good,I enjoyed the ambiance of working in a coffee shop. Always cool music and creative coworkers. They are a risk taking company that is always creating new items for there menu.
good,"Starbucks puts so much money and provides so many resources for partners, it has been a wonderful experience as a whole. It just boils down to the store manager being less than professional as to why I'm exploring other opportunities."
good,"Be prepared to be thrown into the deep waters. You will be trained accordingly, however, Starbucks wastes no time on throwing you into the fire. They have wonderful standards and the dress code is as comfortable as you want it to be while maintaining a good appearance. The company offers wonderful options in benefits and they are within financial reach. The management is good when there is a strong leader present, and the culture provides almost a ""safe haven"" feel."
good,"I worked at Starbucks in college, and it was a really fun place to work. It was never a career for me, but it paid the bills and gave me a flexible schedule that I could built around my classes. And free coffee in college doesn't hurt!"
good,"The benefits are stellar, but now many companies offer similar packages. Great if you are trying to get a degree with the ASU program. The company has stagnated over the past couple of years and the stores are taking the brunt of the responsibility with cutting labor, ensuring tenured employees are scheduled fewer hours, expecting managers to work well above 40 hours consistently. Accountability for employees not demonstrating outstanding performance above and beyond the scope of the job is tough for little above minimum wage."
good,"every day was  different its how you approach and you own attitude."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place to work and the company has amazing ethics, I just happened to get the short end of the stick and got a poor manager..."
good,"When working in starbucks, there are so many things you will encounter especially when in front of the customers. "
good,It's a nice little Starbucks that does a nice volume of business. There are a ton of regulars. The working environment is just great and everyone is friendly.
good,"Although the job is fun and you get to meet very interesting and diverse people, it can be hard to have a social life due to working in shifts and weekends. Also standing on your feet for long periods of time is quite a challenge."
good,"Empresa dinámica de reconhecimento mundial, obedece a estándares de qualidade da marca e actividades ."
good,It was or could be a lot of fun working at Starbucks. Sometimes it got stressful that was really only during busy hours. I believe baristas should be paid better. But as a part time job it can be a blast. If you like coffee and good conversations.
good,"Working at Starbucks always offered new challenges in its fast paced, customer service environment. I learned to think quickly and engage with customers and partners to provide outstanding customer service. As a supervisor I directly impacted the work culture within my location and it was always upbeat and engaging for partners with a team mentality. The hardest part of the job was the long overnight hours, while the best part was the knowledge experience gained through customer and product interaction."
good,"While fun and interesting, Starbucks is a fast paced and stressful place to work. As a Barista or a Shift you will be on your feet 99% of the time. The only time you sit is for breaks. The best part of the job is the people you work with, even when lines are long and many drinks are in queue. When there is time you may create your own drinks and experiment with different flavors."
good,"The pay for a barista is minimum wage but there are many other perks about working for Starbucks. You will receive stock in the company after 1 year of service, free bag of coffee every week, free drinks while you are working, and awesome benefits if you are a full time employee."
good,Managers take the time to cultivate your skills and set you up for success. Health and educational benefits are a plus. They provide opportunities to advance within the company.
good,"Starbucks is where I began my coffee knowledge journey, I learned so much about the coffee culture and practices as well as earn my certifications thru the company."
good,Always great for a first job and also to advance your career and get your foot in the door when it comes to customer service. Opens many doors regarding careers and also personal connections.
good,"The reasons to work here are limited-- because you're a student, because you're a graduate, or because you need decent health insurance, but can otherwise support yourself financially."
good,"I loved working at Starbucks I was always happy to go into work, if I ever needed anything I wasn't afraid to ask a coworker or manager. The food and beverages are always top quality and there are options to chose for a healthy choice.."
good,"It is fast paced and very complex. Lots of multi-tasking and lots of time management. Pushing sales, managing drive times and also day to day responsibilities. Salary based with possible bonus but hard to achieve. Managing the partners and maintaining Drive thru times."
good,"days can be tough as it can get very busy but regular customers make it worth it. "
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks, there was a wonderful fast paced feeling that always kept you busy, and fantastic benefits.  Too many other employees were hired at my location so I did not receive as many hours."
good,"Depends on the management at your location. The younger the staff, the more difficult the job becomes. Not enough accountability, and there is favoritism"
good,This job was actually really fun. It was my first job and the company really loves helping people get started in the work force. I came in during the college fund time and the free schooling is actually at a good university. You get tips on top of your hourly. Recommended highly.
good,"most enjoyable thing about the job is getting to know your usual customers and seeing their face when their drink is made before they've paid. my manager was amazing and understanding, gave me a set schedule every week, which i loved."
good,"I worked there a year. I like it. it was fun making drinks. The managers are mostly nice. They listen to the problem and try to fix it. The only thing I did not like was, our staffs are asked to help at other stations but when we need help, it is hard to find someone to help us."
good,I work at a drive through location so it is more fast paced than most. It is somewhat hard labor. You get great benefits and it seems like they care about their employees. Best place I have ever worked at. I've been there for over two years.
good,"A very fun fast moving paced environment that allows you to create memorable experiences with customers and co-workers. Allows room for creativity when making drinks, although time management for drinks can be one of the hardest parts about the job, making our drinks is still one of the best parts about being a barista."
good,"Working at Starbucks has been so good for my self esteem, and coming out of my shell. Everyone there, staff and costumers included, is very friendly. You get treated like family from the very beginning."
good,"Trabajar en Starbucks a diario era constantemente muy tranquilo, ya que mis compañeros solian ser muy respetuosos y me atendian y enseñaban en todo lo que necesitara. Dentro, aprendi a hacer todo tipo de cafe y comidas y la cultura del cafe. La gerencia siempre era muy buena y responsable. Lo mas dificil del trabajo era poder memorizar tantos cafes. "
good,"Working at Starbucks has it's ups and downs. I really wish that I got paid more for having to deal with such a fast paced environment and I wish that they had health/dental/vision benefits. The job is truly structured for teenagers and young college students, but not for somebody like me who is trying to start a family as a newlywed. I love the cohesion that I have with my coworkers and how everyone is so accepting of everyone, but the job is hard and not for the faint at heart. Also the varying schedule is a plus and a minus."
good,Starbucks is a fine company but management is poor and job security is also poor but the healthcare an dental is good an pay is pretty spot on overall pretty good
good,Starbucks can be great if you have the right team. My manager was not the best but there are really good managers out there. You can make good friends there. I met the love of my life there
good,"Their culture is fun and encourages you to be yourself. I learned quite a bit about management and partner development as well as the true concept of satisfying the customer. Their training is done very well and they promote the culture throughout all of the training. They want you to love what you sell, which is easy to do."
good,A typical day as a shift supervisor includes dealing with many customers in a fast paced industry. Managing time effectively is a must since they're many aspects of the job. From dealing with a bad experience a customer had to maintaining a clean espresso bar. The work place culture is the most enjoyable since each retail store is like it's own family. The way we help and take care of each other.
good,"I like the fast paced work place and benefits. It's most enjoyable and easier on everyone when coworkers do their jobs efficiently. However, my location lacks the work ethic needed to do so."
good,"Work their for awhile a lot of my co workers were my friends.  We all got along and made it very easy to manage every department with little to no conflicts.  But it seams the only to move up in the company is to know people within or, working 70 hour weeks."
good,"It was a great place to work at, i leaned many things working there but i have to say the culture and the actual employees is what i liked best. Benefits and compensation are at market standard, opportunities to move within the company are always there."
good,"Great company that takes cares of its partners, the culture can be challenging for Management but hourly employees are treated with more respect than I've ever seen in life."
good,"Even though starbucks is a fun place to work it can also be very stressful.  You have to make each drink specific to each customer , if they are not happy with it you try  again.  This can upsat the people in line behind them."
good,For those seeking a flexible schedule for school or for a second job it's a great place. The work can be very demanding but also fulfilling. The company is very keen on constant change which can cause a bit of disorientation on top priorities. There are opportunities for promotion but that process can be difficult.
good,"I Loved working there a lot of pressure in sales though. Even though I exceeded my sales I was still under constant pressure to do more sell more and there was a guilt put on you if a potential sale walked out the store, it took the fun out of sharing your love for tea with people and the pressure to sell became too much, but everyone you work with constantly encourages you to do better so it was a very positive work place to be in"
good,"Great environment, very fast paced store. Employees were very friendly and worked well together. We were allowed to pick up hours at different stores."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. It is a great first time job and great felxiable work schedule for students. Great benefits for everyone, stock in the company is great, and the college program for students is great."
good,my typical day at work is giving a genuine smile for customers. extending help whenever I needed to. What I have learned is be considerate and anticipate help to others. and the most enjoyable part of my job is when we go out for late dinner after work.
good,"The company itself is very fun to work with. Great energy and they really know how to take care of the employees. Partners (coworkers) are also very easy to get along with and you get to meet interesting and new people every day. Management at this location is a little challenging at times but know your schedule can be easily worked with once you're hired. The most enjoyable part of the job is making positive customer connections and getting to see them again, solely because they enjoy your locations energy and service. The hardest part of the job would be the occasional miscommunication between partners and customers. But that can easily be overcome once you get used to the coffee lingo."
good,"Mastery of brewing coffee where i learned at Starbucks and get certified as coffee master.."
good,It is a busy job filed with many odd jobs but defiantly worth the people and experience. Id rate 9/10 for a days work of fun and customers are usually pretty great.
good,"Busy. Fun. Exhausting. Exciting. Tiring. Dealing with some customers isn't the best, but working with great people is what makes this job pretty fun! A lot of changes all the time; keeps things exciting."
good,"Starbucks is a great company that will make you feel valued as an employee. At the same time, Starbucks is a company that loses touch with what is actually possible in store. It's not that they expect you to work hard, it's that some things they want to happen (quickly!) just aren't feasible in store. But it's hard to complain about a company that offers free college, PTO to part time, and plenty of room to advance."
good,"i learned how to make drinks, management was good, it is at times a very fast paced job,there really is no hard part of the job, and seeing customers repeatedly is my favorite part."
good,They sell coffee and snacks. What more is there to say?  There is   free WiFi and   it   is   relaxing.  It can be very busy in the morning and   hectic.
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work where one can gain great personal development with the public.  It is a fast paced environment where you will never be bored and also have time to connect with customers.
good,"Amazing and very fun Culture, focused on customer service as well as on Health and work life balance of its employees. Loved the people and working there. would recommend to anyone who is looking for an organization they can be proud of working for"
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, but unfortunately my time was cut short due to school. I am pursuing a B.S. in Biology and often times I had no time as a student to study and go to work, so towards my last few weeks of college, I resigned to focus on finals."
good,"I loved working for strabucks because of the busy fast-paced environment. Typical day at starbucks would be getting all the coffee brewing when you open, prep your mocha and other sauces, prep whip cream, make drinks, connect with customers, stock up on cups coffee straws sugar honey teas otmeal all of it. doing dishes, sweeping, mopping, unpack delivery, inventory, etc."
good,"The job is quick-paced and can be stressful. I didn't particularly get along with many of my coworkers unfortunately, but the management was generally very good. Starbucks provides great benefits even for part time workers, and I would definitely recommend it."
good,"Starbucks can be a very enjoyable place to work. Friendly coworkers, fun drinks to make and a fast pace. Dealing with customers is the difficult part. As great as the benefits are, and they are, it is hard to tamp the irritation down when one is dealing with unruly customers. This, like most customer service jobs, is rife with rude individuals and harsh commentaries on personal performance. Customer service is not for the faint of heart."
good,"this job showed me the more mature side of the food industry, with there being so many starbucks around they have great management, and employee benefits."
good,"Good company to work for, very fast paced, great benefits. Can be exhausting. Lots of opportunities to further your career. Recommend for a college student."
good,"""Typical day at work"" I'm taking an order in drive thru and a customer speed pass the order box and I asked are you race car driver and within seconds we both started laughing!"
good,"The typical day at work was a very enjoyable experience. Whether on bar, at the window, or working the register, the quick pace made time fly by. The most difficult part of the job was working the window when a very incompetent person was placed on the task of making the drinks. However my favorite part of the job was getting to know all the regular customers that would frequent the store. My first Starbucks boss was great! She was very rule oriented and kept the store clean and quick at all it was supposed to do. However my second boss was not the same experience. She was very strict when it came to time off and was a disaster at scheduling."
good,Loved this job. Built  a lot of clientele and very fast paced. Very rewarding and great surroundings. Training employees was fun as well. I loved staying busy
good,"All in all, I enjoy working for Starbucks. Some days I feel over-worked but the friendly co-workers and customers make it worth the job. If you get easily annoyed by people, do not bother working for Starbucks, you will not enjoy it."
good,Starbucks carries many different positions within the floor. My Favorite part of the job was engaging with customers and my least favorite part of the job was cleaning the bathrooms.
good,"A fantastic first job to have, you learn a lot alongside great co workers and clientele. I always enjoyed the atmosphere that the store provided not only for myself but others as well."
good,"This is actually a pretty good job for what it is. The problems come with the fact that like anything else you don't have control over the management. Some managers will throw people onto the floor with no training. Most store managers I've worked with have been hired from outside the company and fast tracked into their positions. Shift management is largely not worth the trouble, so more experienced partners tend to stay in lower positions with less responsibility but at similar pay. Speaking of pay, while positions start above minimum wage it's not by much. The upside is that the benefits are insane. Great health, dental and vision care. 401k with contribution match up to 5%. Stock options with yearly grants. This is a great part time job for someone who wants the insurance but honestly the pay is just not nearly where it needs to be keep people around for long."
good,ProvidING customer service. Handling money. Rotating products. Preparing products. Being knowledgeable about drinks and food. Have to pair coffee with pastries
good,"Seamless system for everything. It will change you, you must be on your toes! They have re-defined what it means to multitask they call it sequencing."
good,Pour ne pas être rester longtemps dans l'entreprise j'ai apprécier l'ambiance de l'équipe et la façon de travailler la prise en charge des nouveaux venu et les conditions de travail
good,"always had great customers, very friendly vibe, management was ok. had fun making the different beverages. interesting new faces and beverages constantly rotating."
good,"a normal work day started off busy from the moment I walked in"
good,This position contributes to Starbucks success by assisting the store manager in executing store operations during scheduled shifts.This job deploys partners and delegates tasks so that partners can create and maintain the Starbucks Experience for our customers.
good,"The job is not just about making coffee, but also about making customers happy in every situation, while keeping the store clean and managing time well. It's true that coffee comes first, as does customer service, but you will also need to know how to clean well, how to be nice to the people on the staff, and be a true team player. The job doesn't rely on one person, it relies on a team. It HAS to be a group effort or it won't work."
good,Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. I always highly suggest friends and family to work at Starbucks because the work is always fun and exciting each and every day.
good,Working for this company was really fun and enjoyable! Learning from eachother and teaching others to do better. Benefits were great and working around what is most comfortable for you!
good,"I love going into work everyday, because I know all my co-works are so nice. We all get along really well, I do wish we had more time to talk to each other so we could be closer, but we are often told to get back to work if we stand and talk. I love the environment and the costumers are very nice other than a few here and there. "
good,Its great to be at benefits are great tips are great and they work with you if you have a problem. only problem is that managers are interchangeable and you might catch a dud.
good,"This truly was one of my favorite jobs!! I loved my manager and the job, but a target starbucks leaves little room for advancement without a degree and the compensation for the job is wanting. You aren't allowed to accept tips and you get none of the usual starbucks perks; such as, drinks while on shift (you pay close to full price for every one) or an employee meal (10% target employee percentage off again here). The hours were few unless it was the holiday season. Overall, really fun job - best for college students or high schoolers."
good,Starbucks offers quite a bit. schooling for those who want it. flexable  times. you can go up the ladder pretty fast. learn to be a coffee master. Tips
good,"The hardest part of the job is when there is a rush and there is a long line of customers waiting for drinks, I love mt job and I love the class of starbucks, I love to keep busy which is why this job is perfect for me."
good,"high paced environment but normally lots of fun. Management will work with you to help train and advance your career. slightly high level of turnover in upper management, but you will fall in love with your regulars!"
good,Nice people. Nice place to work with. Benefits are competitive. I would recommend it to everyone who would like to experience to work in a company that will help you to become a better version of your self.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. The employees are committed to their jobs and enjoy coffee. "
good,"I love working for Starbucks. I have met thousands of wonderful customers along my 14 year journey.  The benefits are outstanding and the hours have always been plentiful. "
good,Working at Starbucks has been a really good experience for me. I was ale to meet a lot of really good people; both coworkers and customers. I learned a lot about how anticipate what others need and get that for them in a way tat makes everyone happy.
good,"most enjoyable is the great workplace environment and coworkers, hard part is dealing with rushes in drive thru and front with not many co workers on the floor, and running out of products/back ups. learned a lot about teamwork and coffee."
good,"It's super easy, fast paced, and great environment. The employees are wonderful they have great teamwork skills. I would love to work there again but getting paid more."
good,"Day to day you meet different people who can be funny or not funny people sometimes. The most important thing is the customer, so dealing with them with love and professionalim is the best way to make the happy and come back againg and again to the coffee shop. Starbucks have given to me a great experience where I took many positive ways from my colleagues to up date my customer services skills."
good,"Fun work place since you get to talk to people and get to know them and become their friends eventually. Everyday you meet different kind of people and some of them shares how their day have been. It is pretty fulfilling. Feels so good to see a connect to strangers,"
good,I really enjoyed my team at Starbucks. It was a fast paced and focused environment. Lots of room to grow by either moving up in management or fine tuning your skills as a barista or learning as much as you can about coffee. Big bonus was the amount of schooling they paid for. The company really wants you to grow and persue an education.
good,"A wonderful place to work where the coworkers and management make the workplace truly enjoyable. A typical day is generally quite busy, but each individual is given a specific role to follow, and the opportunity to switch roles if it becomes boring. Everyone is so helpful, and questions are always welcomed. Management is great, and so are the opportunities for advancement. In my opinion, the hardest part of the job is when you first start, because there is so much to learn and remember; but once you get the hang of things, its good. I enjoy all aspects of working here, especially making the drinks. Mostly because it gives you the chance to be super creative, and is especially rewarding when customers compliment what you have served them."
good,"Starbucks is a great job experience to start off right after high, good flexible scheduling for college students, and enjoyable job to have towards your career path."
good,"a typical day at work is full of routine you learn a lot about how to preform your best at Starbucks the management team will become your friend still keeping it professional the hardest part of the job is not becoming tired of the same coffee drinks , the most enjoyable part of the job would be coming into work everyday knowing you will have to face a new obstacle everyday."
good,Greta place to work. Very customer service driven and there are benefits to part time workers. ability to learn an interesting craft.
good,I have worked for Starbucks for over 2 years now. It's a great work environment. Starbucks has really taught me a lot in customer service.
good,It was pretty easy working here. There was always something to do from discovering new drinks to setting up the new merchandise.
good,"I would typically set the store up to make sure we have what we need to stay open for the day, I would make sure the baristas are on task and getting their work done. I would send people on breaks and lunches, work on the deposit for the previous business day, assist with creating the schedule."
good,"A day at work was fun, fast paced when busy, and very productive. My co-workers were team players and loved working together, the only downfall of my experience was the management. The management was absolutely wretched, I have never been so ill-treated in my entire life. The hardest part of that job was probably the way we were treated as partners under our manager."
good,"Constantly learning on the job. Friendly environment, filled with wonderful customer interactions. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace during the holidays. The most enjoyable part would be interacting with each customer, and finding out their story."
good,"i learned being fast and focused to be handy and having a good attitude is very important.."
good,Friendly team of employees that offer a great work experience. I love the customer and really enjoyed making their beverages on a daily basis.
good,"Starbucks is a great company overall. My customer service skills grow more and more each day, and there is always something new to learn. The most enjoyable part of the job is developing memorable moments and relationships with customers."
good,"Starbucks is an excellent company to work for as a student. The company takes pride in hard work, Military requirements and family obligations. They provide decent medical insurance. The company itself it very open to change and new ideas. The corner stones of the company provide good learning experience on how to work effectively with others, how to communicate with customers and how to work in a timely manner to ensure customer satisfaction for both quality and quickness. Starbucks is widely accepting of workers and they're overall a very good company to work for."
good,"Everyday we are expecting rush hour, we are busy since the time we open the store until closing. I have learned how to make beverages, handling customers properly and how to work fast and focused. My manager and co-workers are kind and helped me if i needed help. The hardest part of the job is to memorize all the ingredients, procedures and the expiration date of each but if you love your job you will get to used to it. I enjoyed making beverages, chatting with customers and learning everyday."
good,"A moving industry in food that incorporates all walks of life."
good,"Un- payed internship."
good,"I enjoy my position at starbucks. You grow with customers and employers. We make starbucks a place for people to get away and relax after a long day,"
good,"It was wonderful to engage with customers and employees while being efficient to complete duties during each shift. Working at starbucks an employees responsibility is to have knowledge on the coffee culture and share it with customers. Each sale we informed customers concern on the product they are purchasing such as, a beverage and their preference on flavour, health or expense. The first three weeks the hardest part of the job was memorizing all ingredients for each beverage during the holidays, however, once rush hour then it became habitual to assemble beverages. Practice makes perfect. The most enjoyable was interacting with employees and customers and being able to decorate for the holidays as there's always new seasonal beverages"
good,"easy job when you actually learn the stuff fun and super awesome people to work with"
good,Great company and amazing co-workers! The hours were pretty steady and the constant cash from the tips every week. Had a disagreement with the head of management and decided it was time try and transfer and then she took it personnel and I decided to take my leave from that point. Although everything else even though a daily fast paced environment everybody was friends And got along and operated amazingly. While still getting a quality drink or food cooked and ready within reasonable time.
good,I got to make drinks to customers and since I worked there for a long time I got to know the customers personally where I got to learn new things from customers as well.
good,Working here was so much fun & a great learning experience. The fast paced atmosphere was my favorite part of the job. Never a dull moment & your customers become not only that but they become your friends.
good,"This job would be perfect it if wasn't for the lack of shifts we have. The two we have are stretched to the limit. Other than that the workers are fun to be around super fun and very upbeat. The customers you encounter are pretty great. The benefits are pretty great, free food, free drinks, free pound of coffee or tea each week."
good,"At this job, a typical day consists of ordering, receiving product, performing inventory, creating innovative and unique ways to motivate my employees and engage with the guests in a ""5-diamond"" manner. "
good,"Great place to work with great benefits.  Many opportunities and resources for both professional and personal development."
good,"Love the environment of the customers and co workers. Exciting work environment. You have to be a people person to work there, which i am. you connect with a lot of the regulars and you learn about their lives just as much as they learn about yours."
good,The Job in the right team can be very fun and there is a lot of family atmosphere however the job at the same time is very hard due to a very demanding company.
good,"Partners are wonderful. Management leaves the store unsupported, customers are treated well above what they deserve in a retail environment"
good,Teaches one to be fast on their feet and be able to multitask.  The day is busy but flies by and the skills learned in not just coffee brewing but also interpersonal skills are a boon for the rest of ones life.
good,"Great with scheduling. Be firm with them. Be ready to work hard, physically and mentally. I'm very fortunate to have worked there, but so happy the day I left."
good,I consider my fellow Starbucks partners to be my second family I enjoy the interactions I experience not only with partners but with customers as well. I have grown as a person by new learning experiences and meeting influential people.
good,"I loved working at starbucks, seeing the regular customers everyday always made me happy. Being busy all hours of the day made it go fast and I enjoy nothing else then working hard. The only downside was the people I worked with. They were snobby, management was poor, and the negativity brought me down. I want a job like this again but all I ask for is a better attitude among the employees."
good,"Starbucks is actually one of the places I loved to work at, a day there would be making customers happy on their beverages maybe they're having a bad a day an need something to cheer them up. I learned to multitask with making beverages in so many ways it gets quit busy working and satisfying customers. My co-workers are very nice and friendly and made me feel comfortable working there and Starbucks was my very first job I have ever had. The hard part about working there was to memorize all the drinks you had to make and specially when I had to close by myself but its very fun at the same time. I honestly have to say I'm very blessed to have been apart of working at Starbucks as a barista because it is something different you get to see kid and adults smile on the beverages we make they could be having a bad day and need something to cheer them up."
good,"A typical work day at Starbucks is upbeat and hectic. One must be able to multitask with a smile and have fantastic customer service. Rushes can be very over whelming during the day, but having a connection with your regulars is most certainly worth it."
good,Starbucks will take of you if you want to advance in the company. Sometimes a slow process but worth it in the long run. The company is becoming more focused on personalization and using social media to help customers which can be a plus or a negative.
good,"I worked the early morning shift so it was great, I would come into work, get the money for the stores, and start opening. It was fast paced and before you knew it, it was time for you to clock out and head home. I did have to deal with some mean customers sometimes, but I loved it. I loved the experience. The management was still trying to figure a lot of things out so they were very disorganized, but they did care about their employees and always tried to help."
good,"I enjoy working at Starbucks I got along well with every one, well always try our best to please our customer and we always let our customer feel at home"
good,"Working at Starbucks was rewarding in many ways. work on a typical day would be going in in the morning, stocking up and getting ready for the constant rush of customers. I learned a lot as time went on. I knew pretty much everything about the unit by the time I left. from working tills and machines to till checks and waste management. the management were very friendly, helpful and punctual. always there if you were struggling or just  needed a little help. co-workers is the formal name for it, but all the staff at Starbucks were also friends rather than just colleagues. we had a great energy working together and most customers would pick up on this and even smile on occasions, even laugh. the hardest part of the job was it all to be frank fully honest. as we all know Starbucks is a big coffee chain, and with the Starbucks I worked at being on a busy motorway services, there was never time for a sit down. you learn to time yourself with the coffee per customer rate and manage with help from all the team chipping in to ensure the business had a steady flow. I loved every minute at Starbucks really, never one of those same day in and out situations, always something different and challenging everyday but I believed it helped me expand my skills and learn a lot of new things."
good,"Aprendi a ser responsável ter Agilidade,Comprometimento,Manter meu lugar de trabalho sempre limpo e organizado,ter uma boa comunicação verbal,sempre sair de uma situação não agradavél bem e conseguir resolver a situação sem conflitos,atendimento ao cliente sempre,Responsabilidade."
good,Starbucks is a good company. I honed my multi-tasking skills while employed as a barista. They worked well with my schedule.
good,"Typical day would be rushing to open the store and handle customers as fast as possible."
good,"Scheduling was always incredibly flexible, ""partners"" were a cohesive group of individuals; all so different but worked very well together. Pay was good, weekly benefits were amazing. The company seemed to really put an effort into showing how much they cared about their employees."
good,"I had an amazing 21 year run at Starbucks and built a career of which I am very proud and derive great satisfaction.  Starbucks is a values driven organization, where I was able to align my own values with my work.  Starbucks truly is a different kind of company, one where people matter and the organization endeavors to use it's scale for good."
good,"Aprendi nos dias típicos de trabalhos a ter o foco no cliente que se relaciona bem com a empresa passando a visitar continuadamente no seu dia a dia."
good,Starbucks is a great place to grow if you are looking for a job or even a career.
good,"I learned a lot from beginning to end in this job.  Scheduling, merchandising, working under associates and with as well as above.  Hardest part was leaving to further my career.  Time management at times or covering other co-worker areas were always a challenge.  It was great to see that the people I hired move up to assistants with my judgement of hiring and guiding them."
good,"Its a new challenging  day everyday,every person has a different personality so need to understand them and corporate with them."
good,"The job would be more enjoyable, but casino life is hard on people. Which in turn means they are hard on you. Expensive coffee makes a gambler a grumbler."
good,"Working at Starbucks was moderately fast paced depending on the time of day worked.  In the mornings there was an obvious rush and in those times I was efficient and learned great team work.  Management was fairly easy to work with for me, but I heard complaints from co-workers.  For me the hardest part of the job was using down time if it occurred.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the fast pace and team work.  Also being able to put a smile on someones day first thing in the morning by complimenting them or just simply personalizing their drink!"
good,"I have loved working for starbucks, but I feel that in recent years the company has gotten out of control with its standards.  The stores I work at have longer hours, we are open now on ALL holidays, the stress level and expectation is high for how much we are paid.  Starbucks has gotten away from coffee, the company culture is not what it used to be."
good,typical day at work would be waking up at 4 to get there for 5 and clean and make coffee in a very fast paist with team work. hardest past was the coffee match making. the good part about the job was the paycheck.
good,"This job would have been right up my alley had I stayed. I thought that upward mobility was not obtainable. After some time, I have had several friends move up to manager positions that I had worked with. I loved this job, but had hoped to use my education. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the rude customers who expected you to know what they wanted, or dismissively talk to you. Most enjoyable was the fun you could have with your coworkers and regulars."
good,"At starbucks i learned how to make all their beverages."
good,Descent place for young individuals. Starbucks goes through management like they go through water.
good,"Working at Starbucks is a way of life, I would suppose. I interact with customers on a daily basis, and not just bring them coffee and pastries, but I also offer warmth, actual sincerity, and treat them like a human being. It only takes sincere care to turn a bad day into a good one for most people. At Starbucks, this is an everyday thing."
good,"You are the beginning of the world's day. Most people aren't morning people, so you have to get them going not only with coffee but also a happy experience. It also has to be fast, yes they like a pleasant conversation, but you must also provide drinks and food quickly because they need to get to work. You have to be on your toes, because when a rush comes you have to be quick thinking on what needs to be done now and what can be postponed for 15-30 minutes. Being accurate on orders and polite along with cleanliness and constantly stocked on coffee, teas, and espresso. You do enjoy your regular customers and laughs between the rushes with co-workers. Also you get tips weekly, but all depends on your location how much you receive."
good,"Very busy place with something going on all the time, was never bored and really enjoyed working with the people there."
good,"Didn't like my manager because she was very controlling"
good,"fast past environment, you learn great customer service skills, the management is nice, co workers are friendly, the job is fairly easy and you get to meet a lot of different people."
good,"Great work culture, focused on being a for profit company through the lens of humanity."
good,A typical day at Starbucks would be really stressful some days but fun and exciting the next.
good,at kci starbucks you will meet many different kinds of people and  learn the art of coffee it is great all around if you can drive there everyday
good,"A great company to work for, fast paced job. Co workers were always friendly along with management. The hard part about this job was moving up. I was up for assistant store manager and then the company had to cut those positions along with closing many stores across the united states so it made my option for moving up a lot further fetched."
good,"I worked for Starbucks for a little over a year. I enjoyed working as a barista. The customers can be incredibly rude sometimes, but this job allows you to learn to handle any type of situation like that. I enjoyed working as part of a team and the benefits are definitely worth it."
good,"A typical day for me in particular is I open the store by 6AM which means I must turn on everything and warm up the oven within an hour. What I have learned the most from here is my skill in customer service. You speak to the customer as they walk in the door till the minute they recieve they're beverage. So you learn what a customer wants or if they're not sure what to get or find out about a new beverage I help them decide. The good thing about my store everyone has learned to be a very strong independent team! If we have a line out the door everyone gets together and just support each other as much as we can. The hardest part of my job is opening the store but my co workers decide to call in. But then I think of how fast my job will go by and know that it doesnt go unnoticed by the manager who always awards us for our hard work and by not panicking. The best part would be the people I work with, we became a family outside work as well."
good,Starbucks was my first official job and I loved it. I got to make genuine connections with customers and had lots of fun. I learned how to better communicate with people. The manager at my particular store was the reason for me leaving the company and unfortunately not all managers at this company are the best. My co-workers were amazing we were like a big family. The most enjoyable part about my job was putting a smile on people's faces.
good,I truly did love my job at starbucks but sometimes as a supervisor upper management would assign a new employee to my store with little or no training which made it very difficult for me to fulfill my duties as a supervisor because I had to monitor the new employees the entire shift to ensure that they were doing their job accurately.
good,"Day to day management operations of 4+ people. Good people and steady work pace. However, it was a consent struggle of the company to find management of quality and determination.  As well, the refusal of the company to hire within led to  non-knowledgeable managers with little or no experience with starbucks at all.  "
good,"when i am working in Starbucks everyday is a challenge."
good,"um dia típico de trabalho é na quarta-feira e um dia corrido com bastante movimento...."
good,"From this job, I've learned a lot. After becoming a shift supervisor 5 months after I've been hired, it made me realize that I am a good worker and a fast learner to things. I learned how to deal with money and I even became food safety certified. I do like working with my co-workers. They're always in a good mood which puts the atmosphere in a positive work environment. Working at Starbucks is easy, you just need to learn how to move quickly."
good,"Great working environment "
good,"Great Customer service! Loved my co workers! I became the head Bartista, I learned how to prepare drinks for customers and always kept the lobby clean."
good,La culture de l'entreprise est trés importante chez Starbucks ce qui et un très bon point puisque cela entraîne une cohésion au sein d'une équipe de travail.
good,"Une journée type à Starbucks en tant que barista, c'est avant tout un relationnel évident et un échange permanent avec la clientèle. Dès la prise du poste que ce soit la caisse , le bar ou la back-office."
good,"Otimo ambiente, funcionarios muito dedicados, gerencia perfeita, e muitas chances de crescer."
good,"Cash handling, product making, customer service and cleaning went into a typical day. I learned management skills. My co-workers were fun and hard working and my management were helpful and knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was unruly customers but this helped me to learn knew skills in customer service to satisfy. The best part was the fast paced environment and the awesome co-workers."
good,"At Starbucks every day is different, whether it be the fast pace of the morning or the rush to knock out all the closing tasks there is never a dull moment. each shift poses its own unique challenges, the morning, high stress, high customer volume and an expertise in multitasking is essential, whereas the evening is more relaxed but equal in the multitasking requirements. Over the years Ive been with Starbucks Ive learned it is a privilege to be offered the medical, educational and financial benefits available, tuition assistance, retirement plans, full medical dental and vision plans, are a great way to secure a long term employee but also a rarity in the fast food world. I could never ask for better co-workers, they always come through in times of crisis and are always willing to lend a hand to help in any situation for anyone, they are not afraid to take the extra step and go the distance. With the people I work with there is never a boring moment and we are practically a family. The hardest part of working at Starbucks is not the recipes for all the varieties of drinks nor the learning to multitask and control stress at warp speed, it is actually the cleanliness and sanitation maintenance requirements to avoid being written up by corporates third party quality assurance auditor (qasa). there are things in Starbucks that have to be cleaned so often it would make an operating room seem dirty, the amount of cleaning and maintenance performed at Starbucks easily trumps that of a janitorial job in the presidents bathroom. Although the stresses at Starbucks are many there is always"
good,"= prepared beverages for costumers, was busy fast pace enviroment i enjoyed to work in cause i like being on my feet."
good,"Typically, working in food service can be tough. People don't see you as an equal. Here at starbucks you are treated equal and with care. Whenever I need time off, which is rare, I get it off. I can't speak for all of the starbucks locations.. Only my own.. I feel it's a great job to have if you are transitioning to another chapter in your career."
good,good place to work as career good raisies and promotions make drinks customer service skills hand money good learning tool
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great way to educate yourself in customer service. Starbucks is well known for five star and everything had to be done perfectly. Enjoyed working for Starbucks HMS Host in O'hare Oasis. From meeting famous people to just plain business men and women. The only negative with the work schedule. Every week varied, it was never a set schedule."
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for after a short time you start to realize that you work with some of your best friends. The atmosphere is conducive to nurturing relationships between people, something that I feel we as a society have lost to technology. I work swing shifts, so that is difficult, however a typical day seems to be swift and smooth moving. Daily routines consist of customer connection and service along with partner relations. I would manage the schedule, dispense breaks/lunches, maintain surplus of inventory, along with numerous other responsibilities. I think the only thing that Starbucks hasn't been offering me is an opportunity for advancement."
good,"A regular day at Starbucks was never just regular. That is what I loved about the company. Each day brought something new, and there was always something to learn or teach. It was an ongoing, learning process to be able to be the best barista you could. There was so many pros versus the cons. Maybe the only con was sometimes running out of certain products and telling the customer we could not provide that, at that moment in time for them."
good,"amazing time at Starbucks, great training and development and a culture second to none."
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work.. The company is very generous on there benefits.
good,"Talking to guests, helping with fixing problems guests have. My co-workers are friendly so it makes the day even better. The best and hardest part is the fast pace nature of the job, because your always mulit-tasking, which can be tiring but also makes it fun and your day/shift fly by!"
good,"Hours are flexible, people are fun, work is easy. Its good for people who work for enjoyment and less for the money. Tips are miniscule and hourly is low but the job is low stress with lots of laughs."
good,Great job for being in the food service industry. Relatively well paying and good working environment.
good,"Overall, It was a nice place to work, great place to meet new friends"
good,Fast paced
good,"My manager was insane, she tried to intimidate everyone on shift constantly. Always in your face micromanaging you on the floor in front of customers, constantly blamed partners for store’s poor sales"
good,"I worked for Starbucks for 11 years and 4 months. I developed a high team base work ethic. Its a great place to meet new people also to network with customers and build a long lasting relationships with people. I also volunteered at Sacred Heart many times, its a place that gives back to the people in need in the community. They give free food and clothes to famillies that cannot afford to buy food or cant afford clothing. I remember going to Sacred Heart as a child, so I like to give back to the community and volunteer at Sacred Heart for I was once in those peoples shoes. Starbucks allowed me to volunteer at Sacred heart. They also have other volunteering events such as cleaning up a 6 block radius of San Jose near Ocala Middle School. All in all Starbucks is a really good place to learn and grow as a person to become a better version of yourself."
good,"good management, fun work environment, they took their time to train you and worked individually with all workers, I enjoyed working here and would recommend this job"
good,"Typical day involved, being designated to a certain station. Be that as a Barista or Cashier. "
good,"Although I work for a franchised Starbucks in Niagara Falls and Nova Scotia, I would say it has been my favourite job so far. It is an upbeat environment and it seems to have a positive effect on people."
good,"Responsable, pulcra y puntual. Mucha gente iba por mi."
good,I loved working here the costumers and coworkers were the absolute best.  I especially loved that they offer an amazing college program that everyone should take advantage of.
good,The company has many programs designed to assist their employees with personal issues such as dealing with mental health issues and issues like losing your home for whatever reason.
good,Days are spent on your feet for up to 8hrs which can be tiring. Is a fast paced environment so decision making must be done fast. It is shift work so hours are unpredictable. Getting to know customers on a more personal level is great!
good,"In order to grow and progress in the company you have to be the one who goes out to get it , management will not come to you. If you wish to go up in management performance is key."
good,"On an average day at Starbucks, one can expect the store to be extremely busy. Although it may become overwhelming and stressful at times when it is busy, it helps build organization and time-management skills. The team I work with is also very helpful, kind, and encouraging so if one ever feels overwhelmed, it is important to ask for help and look out for one-another. The overall environment of the store is peaceful and I have learned a lot about coffee and food services in the time that I have worked there. Since I usually work in retail clothing stores as a sales associate or stylist, I found this job to be very different and difficult to adjust to at first, but because I have worked at many places, I used my teamwork skills to help improve my experience."
good,A typical day at work starts with cleaning and making sure everything is stocked and ready to go for the day. Assisting fellow partners with crafting drinks and making sure that each customer is satisfied with their order.
good,"High stress"
good,"They are supportive and it’s a very busy and upbeat workplace. You get a lot of benefits that make it very easy to want to walk into work everyday. Free bag of coffee a week, Spotify."
good,The company provided a balanced work and personal life. They have lots of MTO if there is a lot of down time which gives you time to take care of other things but your paycheck will be very short.
good,"Simplemente porque hay muchas cosas buenas que tiene pero que se contrastan con una sola gran cosa mala, en ver a los empleados como un número más en vez de personas."
good,"Great crew and customers.  flexible work schedule, great learning opportunity.  "
good,"They really care about you as a person, but there has been a lot of culture changes throughout 2019. Switching from being a founder-led company to a founder-inspired company. Great culture and balance when compared to other big companies. Would recommend working here if culture and social impact is important to you. Granted, you do get paid slightly less than comparable technology companies since it a coffee company."
good,"I learned what a strong manager and a terrible manager looked like and modeled all my future management roles around those two experiences. I was frequently challenged by those around me to develop and as a result, I became a forward-thinking leader and motivated partner. The most rewarding part of my job was working with the partners and developing lasting professional relationships with my peers."
good,I loved my coworkers but when helping out at other stores there was a difference in procedure and management style.  Starbucks needs to standardize the experience for their employees. I did like how the drink and food prep was consistent across all the stores. It just come down to different employees at different locations.  I loved the opportunity to work with different crews across multiple locations.
good,"I landed at a store where manager was not so friendly, or encouraging. I dealt with feeling belittled and forgotten for many months. In my case during my interview I focused on showing I was nice and approachable. If I were to do it over, I'd have thought harder about whether I felt the manager and I made a good fit. Your manager calls the shots at the end of the day, so if there's a connection at the beginning then go with it. Starbucks has many stores, so that you should never worry about."
good,"Location and co-workers were friendly, hours were flexible albeit inconsistent... All in all, it would be a perfect place for someone younger to start out to learn an industry."
good,"Working for Starbucks so fun, but it is a fast pace environment. Management is fun, and the benefits are great, but hard to move up within the company."
good,"This job needs attention to detail, quick feet, quick thinking, and able to keep working on your feet. Calm head and positive attitude. It’s a tough job, but a good one."
good,"Typical day of work includes greeting customers, maintaining cleanliness of store, restocking items around the store, food and beverage preparation, and ensuring you've taken the correct order"
good,Starbucks was one of my favorite places to work.  You could do anything from starting your day making coffee for customers to ending on a great note with friends.  The only reason I had to leave Starbucks was because there were not enough hours for me to make a living.
good,Its a very fun place to work at but if you can't deal with stressful situations and customers who may not be nicest this is not the place for you. You must be able to keep a level head during peak times and maintain the Starbucks standard.
good,"I would greet the customers and ask them how their day is going. As a barista I would beverages, such as coffee and tea. Assist the customers with any questions."
good,"Everyday is a different day; always exciting to learn new things. From recipes to regular customers. There is never a dull moment when you work for Starbucks. Superb culture, making you engage to the new learning. American practice of addressing colleagues as if they are a brother or a sister and the trust that they give to each employee--allowing them to wear the uniform wherever we are knowing that we carry the name of the brand and therefore wouldn't want to act on anything negative in behalf of the company."
good,Working at Starbucks provided me a wonderful experience to grow as a person and explore what I can and cant do while at work. While days can and do get extremely busy they always manage to keep things fun.
good,"Working for Starbucks has molded me into the adult I am today. Although I personally did not become a manager seeing people who trained me now go into management really shows that there is room for growth. The entire company takes pride in making sure employee's are taken cared of and that is what has kept me on the team for so long . Id say the hardest part of my job is the amount of food Starbucks wastes at the end of the day. I truly am hurt by that action because there are thousands of family's that could use a meal even if its just a free sandwich. Only with management approval we can give a homeless customer a free sandwich or salad and every time we do it warms my heart. I have learned how to read people better than I ever have. Customers who haven't had their coffee yet I know to move faster with their orders , or if a customer has a walker or in a wheel chair id come from behind the counter just to give them their items . Really being able to read each customer and service them as best as I can ."
good,Highly recommend the company. The benefits package they offer to everybody even part time employees is far above the minimum offered by another company.
good,"Great place to work. I have no complaints, the shop I worked out closed down and I did not want to relocate to another store. I'm still close with member from my team and enjoyed the culture."
good,The job could’ve been better. The managers was ok and the coworkers was always late or calling off. Could’ve pay more ad get raises. But Overall Its Was Okay
good,"The company is great they hire amazing people, but no one is perfect and sometime the bad one slip through the cracks. The store manager at the Nogales store is not have half the qualities Starbucks looks for but shes a good liar, if she doesn't like you she will get rid of you even if you been with the company for 6 years"
good,"If you enjoy a busy, fast-paced job environment, then working at Starbucks is the right choice. I enjoyed the job, and every store's management and coworkers are different."
good,"Starbucks ist immer noch meine zweite Familie."
good,Fun workplace and colleague. Relaxing and exciting workplace. Meet people/customer who love coffee and know about coffee. I learned many new things about coffee.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for . It offers a lot of great opportunities and benefits. I would definitely recommend others to work for such great company
good,"Les employés ne sont pas des simples employés mais des partenaires."
good,"My experience working for this company was great. I just had a poor manager ):"
good,I worked at Starbucks since high school up until 2018 and I personal live the job. I admire coffee culture. The only con I have to say was my manager made it difficult to progress in the company. After she left to another location I was promoted and she had come back and demoted me immediately.
good,It was a fun place to work and i'd consider doing it again if i ever had too. It's cleaner and more fun than other food service jobs I have had in the past.
good,"I enjoyed working there, I was excited to show up to work because those coworkers were not only friends but family. It was very faced paced though, and because of my epilepsy it was not the place for me."
good,No matter what you will typically start just working customer support and food warming roles but very quickly you will get dragged into working bar and register It’s very easy to get overwhelmed with all of the new information that’s thrown at you at the same time and it can be hard to pick up all at once. Personal because I work opening/early morning shifts I had to learn to work bar and register almost instantly because that’s where they needed me the most
good,"Great job for an active, upbeat person. Each day is a high energy, customer focused, opportunity to do your best and enjoy yourself. Lots of responsibility and tasks to do throughout the day, so it requires both good time management skills and motivation."
good,Excellent company starting off to work for and part time work. The benefits were the best I have seen in retail. They promote education and employee work and life balance.
good,I love working for this company. It has great benefits and great working environment. I have been working for this company for almost 9 years and it has been great to me.
good,"A typical work day would be busy due to the popularity of the coffee shop. However, there was always a calming factor to preparing food and drink for the customers. The environment was always warm and welcoming."
good,I enjoyed working for Starbucks becuase of the flexible schedule. Getting to know the customers and their beverage preferences helped build a connection.
good,"I love working at Starbucks. The employees are fantastic, and I love the environment. It is easy to find your place there. The pay is about what you would expect for food service, but you get tips as well."
good,"If you don't like fast paced jobs that require you to work as a team, this is not the job for you. When you work for Starbucks, you are part of the whole boat!"
good,Starbucks is a great place to work and a great place to learn about what it means to be a part of a team.  From learning the different types of coffee beans to putting a smile in someone's face.
good,"The environment and work schedule was wonderful for a full time student! Ability to work an early, late or split shift if necessary. Very supportive coworkers!"
good,Job growth and benefits are what draw people to the company.My only issue is hiring people for day parts too many people are working already. Having open availability equals more hours to work but also means that your schedule tends to fluctuate with the needs of the store which can be irritating at times.
good,"Starbucks has wonderful flexibility with shifts! There are amazing benefits and there is so much to learn. The environment can be very fun. Mornings are fast paced and have many roles that play a part in making the store deliver the best service and quality of products. The employees are great to work with majority of the time and it's all about being a team and making sure tasks get done. The only down side is the pay isn't the best, especially for all the hard work and dedication put in. But it is a great company."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for and has amazing opportunities."
good,"Very fast and very stressful, I do not recommend this to the faint of heart. I enjoyed my time working here as a barista. I will miss some aspects of the job but definitely not others."
good,"Most of my coworkers were fantastic, but the manager made things awful since she never did the work that she was required to do. My coworkers were by far the best part of the job. Working there can be hectic sometimes, but overall it wasn't too bad, it made the days go by faster."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Starbucks. It was fast-paced thus I never felt bored and the hours went by quickly. There are regulars that come in and despite the hundreds of people you see everyday, it’s nice to see a regular and remember their drink order perfectly. It was also a pleasure getting to learn how to use coffee equipment properly. "
good,They work with your schedule. The employees are nice. It's fun to make all  different kinds of drinks. It's nice they let you sample all product so as to be able to sell to customer.
good,Need to have a lot of patience with the customers as they are always right and their coffee is the most sacred thing at the moment of purchase. Management is pretty friendly and understanding.
good,"Starbucks in general is a very fun place to work, especially if you enjoy coffee. However my particular location is one of the busiest in my city, and can be extremely stressful at times, but at the end of the day, it's just coffee, so it's worth it. It's a job that's improved my patience, ability to work under pressure, and the benefits are amazing. I highly recommend it."
good,"It’s a very quick pace environment and you have to keep up to get drinks out or people start to complain, just do your best and your coworkers will help you if you need it. I’ve made life long friendships with them."
good,"You must have resilience in this location. Advancement is very rare, but if you work hard, you just might make it"
good,Fast paced balanced out by down time. Very fun atmosphere. Great coworkers. Very nice customers. Enjoyed trying different coffees. Discount on drinks & merchandise. Free drinks.
good,"Starbucks is a really exciting job to work at, you meet lots of great people and customers and you build great bonds with your coworkers. My favorite part of the job is handcrafting a drink that is special ordered because it gives more of a challenge vs. what were used to making on a daily."
good,"Enjoyed the staff, and the management was fantastic. Would still be there if the pay was a little more. Fast paced so the day went by quick and it’s a joy being able to get to know who the consistent customers are."
good,"Working at Starbucks is a team player role, you’ll have to learn how to work with everybody also you’ll have to think quick on your feet but overall you build some good working skill dash there as well"
good,"Starbucks is a company that heavily relies on team work."
good,"Managers can be picky some managers care and some managers don’t. My store my manager cares a lot about the company and I feel as if she has all her partners in check compared to when I go to other different Starbucks stores, especially the one in my district. As a customer in Starbucks you are supposed to feel as if it’s your third place, and when I go to others I don’t feel that as a customer. Some employees are rude and nonchalant not caring but that’s my opinion. My store is very good but very stressful"
good,"I learned so much while working at Starbucks, I miss the culture and relationships I had there. I have worked in other placed where I have been paid better but you give up the CULTURE. Starbucks really walks its talk."
good,Great atmosphere and great customers.  District Managers rarely willing to help at a store level.  Hard to maintain a work life balance.  Not enough labor given to meet the needs of the customers.  No consistency.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Starbucks, I'm hoping to return soon. It got pretty busy at times but working there gave me experience in all areas of working."
good,"Starbucks is amazing with the way that it can shape a person. You learn a lot about the person you present yourself to the world as when you are doing something for something else besides yourself, how to have good work ethic and moral code, to do more than just what you have to, to really know what you're doing, to really care, even though it only is what it is."
good,I loved working at Starbucks. The smell of coffee was amazing. The customers were great. The only thing I disliked was the manager. She would never be out on the floor making coffee or doing anything yet she still got most of the tips. Very unfair. She would also give better days off and give the good shifts to the associates she knew personally. She would also schedule herself to work the perfect shift. She never opened and never closed. So annoying. But other than that I really liked the job. Also the pay wasn't good. And we'd ber short staffed on the regular.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks, I learned at that job how much I can juggle multi-tasking. I enjoyed working with others, and feel the company offers a great emphasize interpersonal skills, customer service experience, and an appreciation for coffee and specialty drinks working as a team."
good,"I loved being a part of the starbucks team . You really feel like your around family, everyone has such an amazing vibe! & making drinks was really fun"
good,Learning how to make good coffee is the best part about working here. Constantly improving and honing the skills of latte art is a fun challenge to experience.
good,"have to be able to multi task, you work with the same people a lot so they become like family, I made a lot of friends working for this company for 11 years."
good,"It’s a great first job to have, great ppl, and teaches you valuable life skills. Seems difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it nothing is easier."
good,"overall the work load can be stressful, but the work environment typically was light and new things were always happening. I appreciated the opportunity to go to college for free."
good,"You earn a lot of beni fits as a partner. you meet all kinds of different people, no day is ever the same. You learn how a business runs. Your schedule is flexible and working with a team."
good,This job is a very good job to start off with when an individual has just joined the work force. The position does also provide opportunity for advancement and stability only if you are in the position to first come in and work part time.
good,"Starbucks is awesome."
good,I personally love it. Just wish pay was better for recognition on doing a great job. For instance partner of the quarter. Give a boost. Sometimes people work harder than others and still get paid the same when one person works more and leave the rest of the work for the others yet still the same pay
good,"My store is wonderful, but I have covered at other stores that if I worked at full time I would quit immediately."
good,"Amazing place to work, great benefits, great staff, great customers. Super easy to learn and never boring. Definitely great for university/college students."
good,I worked here for two years while in college and it was a great job for a student. My manager was usually pretty flexible with my school schedule. She would give people a hard time for going on vacation though. And sometimes it seemed like she didn't care about people's lives outside of work and that Starbucks was the most important thing.
good,"I had a good time working at Starbucks. If they didn't have health insurance there, it probably wouldn't be worth it because the pay just isn't there. The job offers great flexibility if you're in school but moving up in the company has become increasingly difficult. I've seen people spend YEARS being developed and dragged along to become a manager. Sometimes they don't even do it at all. They just dangle the carrot and drag some people along which is disappointing. I've seen some people who had a lot of potential to be good managers be dragged along by District Managers who never worked in the store in their life."
good,This job eats the clock like no other! Morning shifts fly by but can be overwhelming at times. Night shifts tend to be a little slower but still very fast paced. I recommend getting a job here for kids fresh out of high school and through college. Flexible schedule and great benefits even for part time partners.
good,"It was hard work memorizing all of the drinks at first, but that is the only difficulty. Starbucks' training is so you don't have to think. You just do. So it was very helpful and the things I've learned I've applied to my everyday life."
good,This is a great company to work for with excellent benefits. The drive all there partners to do there best and it is a great company to move up in. Starbucks is very supportive and has many tools to access.
good,"This Starbucks was one of the most accepting environments from the baristas to the manager, all would acknowledge who I am, that being transgender."
good,I enjoyed working there because they care about their employees and made sure i was taken care of. Learning all the drinks tested my skills and abilities and challenged me everyday.
good,"Good at helping you gain experience, to build you up and succeed and be good at becoming fast pace and well socialized with customers and customer service!"
good,Great place the barista take the time to learn about what you like to drink.Taking extra care to make the drink the proper way so that it tastes right
good,"The management was a bit all over the place but other than that the baristas were amazing to work with. I always looked forward to going to work because we were all a family. The hardest part of the job would have to be around lunch time, people are running around, orders are being made, it's very fast paced so I encourage anyone who doesn't feel comfortable in crazy environments to not apply."
good,"*If you are hired by Starbucks, the first thing to do is to set up your 401k account. You will have lots of money saved for your retirement when you leave the job*"
good,The people you work with are great but the pay makes it hard to live for some. It's a lot of fun making drinks and making customers smile each and every day.
good,"Extremely fast paced and hands on.  Very fun place to work, a home away from home,  you're practically family! You always have new beverages to learn.  Customers appreciate the knowledge you possess about coffee and being able to pair the different beverages with food items."
good,Very fast paced fun place to work. I have had the opportunity to meet a lot of great people customers and fellow partners. There is also opportunity to grow with the company and great benefits. The only downfall is the actual rate of pay for the amount of work expected.
good,"Started as a full time barista and three months later, after hard work, applied and got promoted to a shift supervisor! Lots of perks. Free pound of coffee every week, free drink when you’re working and more!"
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for but depending on how good or bad your store manager is, they can make it seem as if Starbucks isn't a great company. Be very careful with who you choose to work for because it is very easy to be lazy at Stabucks and that will deteriorate the business. I loved my time at Starbucks though, things have changed since I left. Standards used to be so high but seem as if they are poor now."
good,"Starbucks is a great first or second job, not a great career. There tends to be a lot of drama between workers, understandable due to the stress and close quarters. You need a manager who hires people that have different strengths but can work cooperatively together. This is very challenging though because people tend to be petty. I only worked morning shifts and this was not the case, it was very fun and I loved the people I worked with, however I did hear of a lot of drama between workers who worked later or between supervisor. If you’re good at staying out of drama then it’s no problem."
good,"Starbucks is the place for young and old partners to come together and be able to make a difference in someone’s day, even if it’s just a cup of coffee!"
good,"Best place to work as a part time job, gives you lots of free time to go to school and other responsibilities outside of work. All fellow employees are helpful and friendly."
good,"Starbucks as a company itself is amazing overall. Unfortunately the experience I had there was not the best and management was lackluster many times. I would recommend applying there as it can be a great experience. Starbucks again, AS A company values their culture as well as their customers and connection. They care for their employees and are making sure they are taken care of i.e. hours, benefits."
good,"Starbucks ist ein Unternehmen, dass einem sehr viele Möglichkeiten bieten kann."
good,"I love the culture and atmosphere. No one can control having some rude customers so that is not Starbucks fault that you may have to deal with them. The benefits make everything 100% worth it. Pay is not fantastic, but benefits compensate for that for sure."
good,"Starbucks is an awesome company that provides numerous benefits, fair wages, advancement opportunities, and a place to develop common work place skills."
good,"Working at Starbucks is great, my coworkers are the nicest people I've ever met.  The supervisors are nice and understanding as well, having to call out for an emergency or having to leave early is never a problem! The hardest part of the job is remembering all tbe drink combinations and names but other than that, I definitely recommend working here!"
good,"I had learned higher management level in my work place. I learned how to make coffee as a professionally and knowledge about coffee beans, how to check the best or worst coffee beans, and countries of best coffee beans come from. "
good,"This isn’t company was one of the best one tocwork for every. The fast paced environment was amazing at making time go by fast. The only thing I wish is that the hours could be more flexible, meaning I could get more."
good,"En la teoría es una empresa magnífica, en la realidad no permite el equilibrio entre la vida personal y laboral está última te absorbe atiempo de más lo cual se contrapone con la ""cultura laboral que la marca predica."
good,"ambiente de trabajo bueno, recreativo, todos están dispuestos a prestar ayuda y explicarte procedimientos a seguir en la empresa con mucha calma y paciencia, se aseguran de que su empleado comprenda claramente lo que debe realizar y como debe hacerlo, existen posibilidades de crecer dentro de la empresa."
good,I enjoyed it a lot. My partners were helpful and I felt welcomed. Free coffee and teas is a plus too. Every week we get free coffee grounds. The HR department was very informative and what they provide for benefit.
good,"Working at Starbucks is hard work, but you get to work in a fun atmosphere with great people.  The insurance benefits are great.  I learned a lot about premium beverages while working there.  I lost quite a bit of weight while working there.  It gets easier being on your feet the longer you work there."
good,"My time at Starbucks has been an amazing introduction to customer service and barista training. More recently there has been trouble at my store concerning management, however, the treatment from the company and co-workers has been outstanding. They were very flexible with allowing me time off to attend auditions and performances. When I first started I was told I was being paid £7h/r, however, the manager had lied to everyone who worked there so I am still unsure what my pay is but it is higher than most places in my area."
good,"Working at Starbucks was a very comfortable environment. The work atmosphere never felt stressful, despite large amounts of customers entering the store at a time. Co-workers and management made the work process very laid back and relaxed, so it was never really stressful."
good,"Enjoyed working here, making drinks. Learning customers orders and names, workplace was pleasant and coworkers were nice andhelpful, great management and good staffing. Paid breaks as well and the hardest part of the job was learning new drinks"
good,Starbucks was a great experience to jump into the work cycle and was incredible at coaching and preparing me for my job. I loved the connections I made with customers!
good,I loved my time at starbucks but i kept having management give me responsibility higher then the role a i worked in and then not promoting me to those position after i had be doing that role for months. i would go back to work for them if i knew that i could actually move up and get the recognition of the work that i did to help the company instead of doing jobs higher then my pay grade without a bump up in pay.
good,"This was my first actual job and I loved it! I learned a lot, had very friendly coworkers, always busy, found ways to connect with people. It could be very high stress when we were under staffed which made it hard to have the customer connections we were expected to have because we were just trying to keep the store running. There are a lot of little tasks that have to be done continuously but it taught me great multitasking and prioritization. I ultimately left because I didn't want to move up in the company, it was not worth it for what I saw my supervisors go through with the management, and I was ready to move on to a more professional job in my field of study in college. This was an awesome job and Starbucks as a company really knows how to take care of its employees as far as discounts, food/drinks while working, and benefits. In return they do hold their employees to a relatively high standard compared other ""fast food"" places."
good,Depending where you work it can be a very good job to have I had several friends I knew throughtout highschool that also worked for Starbucks and some that still do now
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for, they offer very good benefits and discounts to partners. I would recommend to anyone to work there. The only thing is if you feel that you cannot work in a fast paced job where sometimes you are moving very quickly to get drinks out it might not be the job for you."
good,Starbucks has its ups and downs. If it paid more I would go back. They actually pay well but for having three kids the cost of living is too high in my area. Great co-workers and great company to work for.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people, seeing the usuals and getting to know them better. I learned how to communicate better with customers."
good,"Its a great part-time job! Super fast-paced, lots of people, and I get my cardio in for sure! But $9/hour is nowhere near enough compensation for what is expected of us. "
good,It was a really fun job but very fast paced. Just didn’t get enough hours to make a living. I was able to meet new people and create a connection with the regulars and my coworkers were amazing.
good,"The Barista or Starbucks Partner is typical to name for the people who work at Starbucks. The working day hours set up following a fixed schedule that makes by Store Manager. It can be 4 to 8 hours shift, so these job can be a part-time or full time that depends on the worker. When you got in the system, you will get training for culture, customer service, barista's skills, the responsibilities for each position, and maintenance the best condition of store and services. Starbucks's culture tries to make the store becomes to Third place (after home, workplace) which bring to the customer the best experience. The partner is always friendly, open mind, easy going, be the part of a team, supporting the other partner, and sharing the experience. The most important part in the day for the store is opening, the peaks, closing.  The hardest part of this job is to keep calm always, be patient, try to understand customers, treat them unique as an individual. The environment in Starbucks is quite open, having fun at the workplace, enjoying connecting people that can be developed the self-communication, soft skills, reducing the awkward standing in front of the crowd, also help u become more confident, build the basic independent self-financed."
good,"It was fast paced and you learn a lot. Didn't know there was so much to coffee! I loved working at Starbucks, but I have a bigger family now and the humidity of working with the cap on ruined my scalp."
good,Terrible manager at the time. Expected me to do her job for her constantly. Starbucks was my absolute favorite job thus far. I enjoyed the customers and the atmosphere.
good,"Could be a great place if led by the right management, if not a lot of personalities will intertwine. And have to be ready to engage and really put your best foot forward when working drive and or cashier because customers arent always the best."
good,"I enjoy the people I worked with and they were great working around my college schedule. It is a high paced job most times, but that's what I really enjoyed about it."
good,this job has taught me a lot with patients. Its made me understand customers more and i love this job for that. I had tons of fun working there and will miss it dearly.
good,I learned how to better manage my time and how stressful working in the food industry can be. I would say overall it was a very beneficial experience and I'm glad to have worked there.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks, there was a great environment, I had great coworkers who were helpful while i was learning, and an understanding management. I unfortunately had to leave because of personal reasons, but I would recommend for anyone who enjoys a fast paced, collaborative environment."
good,Great company to work for . Poor management to much politics. Very fast paste . Great benefits . stressful at times . Great work life balance . Great systems an training great pay.
good,Depending on the store you work at and who your manager is it can be an awesome environment or a hostile environment. The company itself really takes care of their employees.
good,"very busy all the time"
good,"Fast paced job, great for high school and college students.  Typical workdays include cleaning (equipment, dishes, mopping, etc.), crafting beverages, connecting with customers.  Close-knit environment, mostly relaxed except during rushes."
good,I learned an awful lot from working at Starbucks. Most of I still remember. Being able to use Customer Service skills while doing something you enjoy makes life a happier place.
good,Starbucks was a good experience as far as getting accustomed to fast-paced work environment.  It can be stressful depending on how well you manage the stress
good,"The workplace culture does seem to vary depending on the time that you work during the day but in general everybody tends to get along with each other. Everybody's goal is to work hard and work as a team, which inspires new hires to act accordingly as well. Tips aren't too bad, and the perks are amazing."
good,"I love working at Starbucks been here for 5+ years. Wonderful experience, you get to meet so many amazing people. I’ve had the best time here, you learn a lot too."
good,"Really enjoyed my time working at Starbucks. Management and team members brought a consistent passion to coffee, drinks, and food. Would definitely recommend working there."
good,"As a barista at Starbucks, I loved getting to know my customers and their favorite things to order. It was a very easy going and social environment. The training was great and my tasks were not difficult to carry out. The only problem I had was with my coworkers making snide remarks nearly every time I spoke to them, and my manager did not act kindly toward me. On multiple occasions he publicly humiliated me with scoldings for small mistakes in front of other workers and customers."
good,I loved the location I worked at. It was the first built in Indiana.  There is no drive thru. Love all of our regulars my favorite part of the job.  We had at least 15-20 every morning shift may not have that with a drive thru because of the convience.
good,"Excelente empresa para trabajar, ambiente agradable, aprendizaje diario, trato al cliente de manera personal."
good,I only worked there for a short amount of time. I recently had surgery and had to end my time there but was invited to come back when and if i got well.
good,"My store was such a great experience. I   truly believe it is the people you work with and the regulars at this job. It is really how management approaches team work, challenges, and training. There was definitely a need for more training for both baristas, shifts, and supervisors. Team building exercises would be a nice addition. Online scheduling through something like hot schedules would be ideal."
good,"a typical day could be busy and fast-paced, typically busy around the morning and after 3 pm "
good,"Tive um ótimo aprendizado com tudo que me foi transmitido dentro da empresa, a lidar com atendimento ao público, a trabalhar em equipe,comunicação dentre outras funções..."
good,I loved working there as high-school student. It was fast paced and you were always busy but that was a good thing to me. Super clean. Great benefits for even part time workers.
good,it was a fun place to work the people were very cultured and different there was a lot of responsibility and teamwork to make sure everything got done
good,"Ejercer los labores de barista y promocionar la marca a los clientes utilizando catas , muestras.."
good,"Starbucks is a fun place to work, it’s just very fast pace and can be very stressful."
good,"Even though there are times when moments get really stressful, there are those little moments with your co workers where you can talk and learn about each other."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy. Mostly mornings, when every one would come for a coffee. I was fully flexible, my working hours were very different every day and every week. I could do morning shift and next day evening shift."
good,"The only qualm I had with working at Starbucks was the blatant favoritism. I worked with several people who were best friends with the store manager and they would all go out together the night before they had to open. There was one morning when my store manager scheduled only the two of us to open, and she didn't show up until 5 minutes after we were supposed to open while there was a line around the outside. My store manager and her friends would sit in the back, hungover, not contributing to the workload or helping out. It made me frustrated to see that she didn't hold all her employees to the same standard."
good,"I always enjoyed the staff I worked with, they cared about working around me being in high school. I was paid very well and was excited to learn more about coffee and the company and wanted to move up the ranks in Starbucks."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is never typical. It is very fast paced, intense and wonderful all at the same time. You build a network with customers that become almost like family. You learn what true quality really is how taking small extra steps can drastically change a customers day. You learn to take for granted the small moments of joy in customers voices when they hear your voice taking their order. You learn time management skills not only at work but scheduling school or other jobs around your work schedule. Although the pay is not the greatest they offer amazing benefits. They pay 100% tuition to Arizona State University for first-time bachelor degrees, discounts on merchandise, coffee and food, 401(k), stock in the company and even more."
good,I learned a lot working at Starbuck. My manager and supervisors were fair and great to work with. I learned good money management and customer service working at Starbucks.
good,"Fast paced always on your feet."
good,"Great work life balance, loved my managers, loved coming to work, great relationships were made here, both customers and co workers. I wish i could go back but pay isnt great"
good,"Starbucks is a comfortable place to works. My co-workers made me feel welcomed,and are always willing to answer my questions. It is a fast pace company especially in the morning. My manager made it very warming to ask any questions i had, and i was always provided with a reasonable answer. The company was always willing to work with me even though i transfer back and forth to school."
good,"Friendly, fast-paced work environment with minimalistic responsibilities. Management was really laid back and good to their employees. Great discounts upon employment."
good,Was working at this place and they were taking money from my checks never got paid what I should have and then when you go see a manager they said well I see that you called in once just once but didn't see how many others I covered and made it seem like me not getting paid was my fault great work place great people but very very poor management and judgement here
good,"-A typical day at work normally had me making drinks and interacting with customers. "
good,"recomendada la experiencia en Starbucks. De poder ser, volveria trabajar alli"
good,I had so much personal and professional growth at Starbucks. It is truly a wonderful company to work for. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to travel and make connections with partners all over the world.
good,"Very flexible , fun, and diverse work environment. It can be difficulty dealing with customers but made a lot of customer friends and worked with the company for over 5 years."
good,Starbucks was a wonderful company and never did me any wrong. There is always the option to pick up shifts at other locations besides your home cafe and weekly tips with biweekly paychecks. My personal experience at the location I was in wasn't exactly always pleasant; working at other cafes was always better.
good,"starbucks was very busy all of the time, learning to work with high volumes of people coming through was a very smooth adjustment with welcoming staff and good training."
good,"The store always had a friendly atmosphere, despite what many people think about Starbucks. I learnt a lot in the 9 months that I was there for, I entered the Barista championship and came 3rd."
good,"Most recently, I have opened the store every morning for 5 months. I set the stage for beautiful and meaningful connections between partners and customers. It is my job to make sure the other team members can perform their designated positions efficiently and to the high Starbucks standards. I care passionately for my customers. I recognize drink orders and names while still seeing 300+ people a day. I realize and try to show others the opportunities we have to make connections to people we wouldn’t normally reach out to. I have also supported my store by upholding cleanliness standards that others skimmed past in order to create an organized and clean store."
good,Very fast paced but easy and relaxed. Friendly customers who really would favor some baristas. Excellent partner perks and good working environment for working moms.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work.  The job is high energy and exciting!  Sometimes it can be stressful but when everyone works together it is fun. Management is always friendly and supportive but have high expectations that seem unattainable at times.  Over all I would recommend this job to anyone who loves people and working hard.
good,"I had a great time working for Starbucks. It brought me and some the best people I know together. I believe they have great benefits. And, they care for their baristas. Thankfully their uniforms has changed. Now, I wouldnt mind going back to Starbucks."
good,"open, set up, manage floor in am, do deposit, work floor to 3. Take care of manager duties in afternoon.If admin day, it would be Open then attend meeting, take care of manager duties."
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Working at Starbucks is great and gives lots of opportunity to gain experience with customer service, working at a high pace and remember many recipes and executing them correctly based on the training received. The management was very understanding and patient and always kept the customer first. Many benefits are provided as a company and feels like you have a part in the company as a whole and not just the store you work at."
good,"A typical day at work would consume of a moderate amount of cleaning and set up for the next shift. I have learned the consistent flow of cash, product and supplies; such as(stocking), inventory, training employees. I have also obtained more educated habits, and social skills with serving and helping customers. I believe the management should over all be done by everyone; but with a specific task at hand is an important job, including organization al skills/responsibility/commitment/dedication. In my opinion, the enjoyable part of the job would have to be discovering and learning new things on the daily and communicating  with new faces as well as teaching others how to do the job right."
good,"Awesome coworkers, great customers. It's always changing, new drinks, holiday beverages, new pastries. Great for a first time job or as a side job. U can turn it into a career."
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for a first job. You work with multiple people, learn to work together in a fast paced environment, learn information about the products that you serve and sell and you also have the opportunity to expand your education."
good,"Peak business hours are a wonderful opportunity to hit the ground running each morning, and allow your multi-tasking skills and attention to detail to shine."
good,"The most important things i have learned through my work experience in Starbucks was how to communicate with people(clients), how to offer the best things for them and their needs and how to be helpful. I have learned the whole story of the coffee, i have learned all the different types of coffee and how to recognize the different coffee flavors."
good,"- fast paced, work in many positions"
good,"My job was mostly crafting coffees, maintaining the cleanliness of the store but there were other benefits to working there. One of my unique (and more fun) roles in the store was store advertising and decorating the walls with temporary art and event headlines. Starbucks have also made the change to being more eco-friendly, offering coffee grounds as compost for locals, making a recycling program for the very popular Nespresso pods and reducing plastic overall. The staff were lovely, even when there would be disagreements, we would never leave the store without resolving any issues. The hardest part of the job was leaving it honestly, after two years of working there I had made many loyal friends and my Manager had been wonderful to me."
good,"Starbucks is not an easy job, but it does help you develop the proper skills when it comes to customer service and working under pressure. The hand-crafted beverages were a joy to make."
good,I really enjoy working at Starbucks. I work with some pretty proud and hard working individuals. I also really enjoy so many of our customers that I've grown to be friends with over my time there so far. It's honestly a really stressful job for about 3 months but after that you start to get the hang of things. There is so much information to process and remember which is the hardest part of the job.
good,"Es un gran lugar para crecer y empezar tu vida laboral, aprendes a conectar y mejoras la habilidad de atencion al cliente."
good,Starbucks offers a great chance to learn leadership skills and doe s a great job of promoting from within. The most difficult part would be working with the public on a daily basis. Hours are easy to pick up if needed yet compensation is low for being a highly known company.
good,I have a lot of experience in customer services.to make a happen to all of our customer. All always eyes contact with customer what they want and how can I help for them make a happy
good,"Consistently collaborates with the district and store manager to set goals and put together action plans to assist in maintaining and improving store performance. Uses time management skills to multi task between working with employees on the floor with day to day operations, and administrative duties assigned. Actively makes on the spot and difficult decisions when needed for the benefit of the team."
good,"Very busy but a lot of fun, great environment. The working environment feels like a friendship with all employees. I loved working here you feel like a family"
good,"At first I thought it was gonna be hard to work at Starbucks, but after a month or 2 its really easy. Management is good depending on who is managing."
good,"I love this company and feel very cared for as an employee aside from the usual complaints in any customer service industry jobs! Sometimes people aren't always nice but I genuinely enjoy the sense of community that I have found with Starbucks, the coffee culture, and the job itself."
good,Great place that takes care of their partners. They offer great benefits from day one. I decided to work at Starbucks for the free bachelors degree from ASU!
good,"Much cleaner than your average restaurant. I got hired at a brand-new Starbucks at first. Everything was pristine. I thought, of course it's pristine, its brand new. But then I learned about QASA, quality assurance people that actually come in an check the drains, sinks, and utensils quarterly for cleanliness. I felt empowered that I wasn't just serving people dirt, that Starbucks actively cares for the quality of their stores."
good,"one of the best companies I've ever worked for. I had a phenomenal boss who was willing to do anything we had to do which did wonders for morale. Unfortunately, the pay was severely low and I ended my 3 year career there at under $9/hr meanwhile people who I was training were starting at $9/hr. It seemed a little unfair in that regard."
good,"Overall, I have been working for the company for almost 3 years and I feel that Starbucks is a great company to work for if you're a student because of the flexibility in hours. Management varies from store to store but I have only met managers that are kind and helpful."
good,loved working for starbucks. they were unable to give me enough hours. great people customers can be hard to deal with sometimes. free staff beverages are a lovely perk.
good,I have never meet a mean or unfriendly barista at my store or when i go to other stores. People assume its hard to remember all the drink recipes and what nit but the more you do them the more you realize they are all pretty much the same and it makes it so much easier
good,everyone is friendly and you lean a lot of new skills and a lot of experience with costumers. improves your time efficiency and makes you improve in memorization because you have to remember drinks. the best part of the job is that you get free coffee!!!!
good,"the environment creates fun and adventurous work hours, i love going to work and being with my coworkers because the make the shifts so fun and go by quicker."
good,"Starbucks is a great way to learn about customer service and experience responsibility. A typical day for me at work was coming in counting over the safe, arranging breaks through my shift for my baristas, doing counts for ordering, counting cash drawers, preparing beverages for guests, and keeping a clean store. I would say I learned how to interact with all kinds of people and manage different personalities. The work place culture for Starbucks is extremely important like any other job because you spend so much time with your coworkers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with guests who put you down. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships we made."
good,"The culture is fantastic, they really care about their partners. If you are external, this position is information overload. There is hardly any work-life balance.  Starbucks will become your life whether you like it or not. Nothing bad to say about the company, its a great fast-paced, intense, high expectation type of environment"
good,"Great place to work"
good,"They offered good coaching, and opportunities for experience in management. Management had a period of high turnover however, I had good experiences with the managers and received encouragement and support being a shift supervisor."
good,Wonderful but did not meet my family work balance that I needed. Would work there again but needed more flexibility to meet the demands of being a single parent.
good,"Good work environment. Fun people, somewhat stressful at first but I did get the hang of it. Does get busy during the holidays, must work at a fast pace."
good,Loved it - easy to learn the systems and culture in place there.  Had a lot of fun with coworkers and customers alike.  Appreciated Starbucks as a company and an organization.
good,Was a wonderful and great place to work! Very fast pace at times and was always wonderful meeting new people every day. Highly recommend this job to anyone who loves coffee.
good,"Management could use some work, but it was enjoyable to work with people there. A typical day at work is making food and beverage items. The staff all worked as a team. The culture was very driven."
good,"It was always interesting to see what type of drinks people can come up with coffee. It was a fun place to work, everyone worked as a team and the managers were great."
good,"Starbucks is wonderful if you like to keep busy and talk with people.  Serving coffee is fun and the environment is usually positive.  Sometimes its the worst place on earth, other times its the best place on earth."
good,"Ambiente pacífico e agradável, com atribuições de tarefas padronizadas e filosofia de trabalho em equipe."
good,it was a productive work place at times hectic due to the amount of customers. I had a lot of carrying coworkers carrying customers great way to meet new people and we got tips for the extra effort for doing our job well and kindness
good,"Strarbucks is a great place to work, with great people. Everyone embraces the company culture, and almost becomes like a family. I had a wonderful experience working for Starbucks."
good,It Was A Fun Loving Place. Everyone That Came In Were Full Of Life And Different Adventures. The Staff Were Great Managers Were Okay I Really Enjoy The Fast Pace Experience and Putting Smiles On People Faces.
good,I worked for Starbucks for 8 years and enjoyed being able to meet and interact with a diverse array of customers as well as work with a great number of highly experienced partners and managers who inspired me to provide the best service possible.
good,The culture is great and the pay was decent. It was awesome to learn how to make each drink and learn how to deal with customers. The management was unstable for a while.
good,"Overall I miss working at Starbucks but management was horrible and the way they did scheduling wasn’t always fair. I would close the store and then be sceduked to open the next day which was exhausting since the store closed at 10pm (out by 1030) and I have to start my shift the next day at 4AM. First couple times I didn’t mind but when it started wearing on me, I asked for my schedule to change but they never did."
good,Loved working here. Great job for someone that is in school. Very flexible with hours. The partners become your family. Pretty easy to find coverage if needed or pick upshift when needed.
good,"Working at at starbucks was quite a good customer base experience. The team I was working with was great, of course there were some difficult customers and disagreements but that's only natural in that kind of work environment."
good,"I worked at starbucks for about 6 months. It was fast paced, and could be fun if you had a good team. I really enjoyed learning all about coffee and the practical on the job training. The reason I left is that they just did not offer full time for baristas and I needed more hours."
good,A good company for new workers. Bustling environment. Opportunities to grow and gain hours. Just not the best for family life and time. I will miss this job but I'm ready to find something new!
good,great job to work at. everyone you work with will help and will be really friendly you feel so relaxed at work and your coworkers feel like your best friends.
good,"You can easily pick up hours or give away your shifts if needed. If you have issues, it's only about 20-30 people who work there so you can talk to the boss at any time to work out anything. Don't expect to promote any time soon."
good,the store i work at is a high volume store and can hit a rush at any given time. If everyone works together it can move smoothly and one wrench can through it off.
good,"I enjoyed working at starbucks. it was a fun and fast paced work environment. I enjoyed getting to constantly learn and progress in the company.  Also enjoyed a flexible schedule, made balancing life, school, family, and work much easier."
good,"If you're a barista, you probably won't get enough hours. If you're a supervisor, you'll probably get too many hours. It's not hard, just stressful while you're there."
good,"High pressure work environment that relies heavily on team effort and individual competence. If you like flexible hours, fun environment, and diverse team personality, this is the right place for you!"
good,"Benefits = almost endless possibilities. Discounts too. Not sure what the rate is now but I'd recommend. Hours were pretty good, anything over 20 was good enough for me. Weekly tips. Dress code has changed, it's pretty fun working there if you're a people person."
good,"gm should be moved up from within "
good,"I absolutely loved my job, if they paid more, I would go back. My only complaint was poor management. I loved my coworkers and i loved my customers. I felt like I had a family there, it was a very hard goodbye."
good,my experience working at Starbucks was great I honestly can't complain I honestly wish they could of paid me more than 8 dollars an hour so I wouldn't have to live paycheck to paycheck
good,Starbucks provides an amazing atmosphere and lifelong friendships. during my time there i was able to meet people from all over the states and oversees. i learned the value of customer service and how much the little things like a smile can brighten someones day.
good,I really loved my job till an assistant manager wrongfully terminated me and the state of California gave me the right to sue for wrongful termination.
good,Starbucks is a company that lives and breathes its values at all levels.  Management is engaged and cares about employees and customers...including the coffee growers.
good,I was fun working on Starbucks. The culture was really good and it was really fast pace. The typical work there are to make coffee accurately and expeditiously.
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. This is the perfect opportunity for anyone looking to find work fast, and long term. Starbucks is incredibly fun, but it is a cut throat industry. You are required to remember a ton of information, and hold that knowledge and stick with the policies of Starbucks to maintain a job there. "
good,In your time there you generally learn all aspects that you see staff handling. You have to learn all of the drink recipes and the short hand codes for all drinks and extras. The best part of the job is making friends and learning all the regular customers names and drinks. The work place culture is very much like family.
good,I really loved working at Starbucks it very fun and u get to meet new people. I loved intersecting with the customers hear abt there day the customers always had interesting stories to tell.
good,Working at Starbucks is fun. The people are really cool and helpful. When the store gets busy everyone is really good about doing 110% for each customer while still being efficient.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. Like every other job there are things that may get annoying or repetitive, however I met some of the greatest people while working there. It was like a family, we all took care of each other and never really had bad times. Overall great job!"
good,"Starbucks gave me insight on what it really means to serve the customer, and have a mission and purpose. Always having ethical and purposeful meanings for everything they produced"
good,leverage your own work life balance this is a fun place to work for be open minded and willing to work hard. There is opportunity available constantly
good,"i learned to make a different kind of coffee , frapuccino and a new style of work like in team , because we were about 10 people for schift."
good,It's a fast paced job. You have to be a multi tasker.  Also it's a lot of customer service and forcing on the customer experience.  You definitely have to be able to stand for long periods of time.  Plus willing to work hard and fast.
good,Managers Came To Work When They Wanted To EVERYDAY! Barista's Doing All The Work By Ourselves Daily. We Must Get The Job Done Alone As Barista's. I Hated Going To Work Everyday Knowing I Wont Get Any Help From Anywhere.
good,"Good company to work for, compensation is compensated with benefits. Would not work in my position forever, but it is a great interim job while going to school or pregnancy or as a second job to attain insurance. Excellent benefits. Great coworkers"
good,"Working at Statbucks was awesome. Would highly recommend to anyone curious to apply. If you work hard, and develop a good relationship with your manager getting promoted is very plausible."
good,"overall I had a good experience at stsrbucks. woild I work there again I think I would , I liked the people I worled with and I like the growth I got from working there."
good,"I have worked at three different Starbucks locations, all with varying experiences. High volume stores can be stressful if not properly staffed (which happens often). Management has always been good, schedules are posted two weeks out, I was able to work and attend University at the same time. Coworkers make or break the store experience. Overall I enjoy working there and there are a lot of benefits that keep me here."
good,Starbucks was a great working experience I enjoyed my coworkers. The customers became family. Working at Starbucks gives you a chance to meet different backgrounds of people.
good,I enjoyed the work and it gave me what i was lacking. I appreciated the opportunity to serve the guests at the airport. It was good to make some of the most delicious refreshments.
good,"Quick pace, i think its okay for a temp job."
good,"Well payed, nice management, always busy, meet different people every day, staff very nice, everyday different, never bored, overall good company to work for."
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks, the manager was so amazing and really understood circumstances and had a great balance between boss and someone you could always talk to. My coworkers were the best and the atmosphere was great. The only reason I left was the pay. As an adult you simply just need more money to survive especially where I live."
good,"On a typical day of work, Starbucks can be pretty busy and it is a fast paced job. I appreciated this because it made time go by a whole lot faster and it was always better when working with a good team. There is always room for improvement at Starbucks which I liked. We work closely with new partners in order to enrich their skills so they can be the best barista they can possibly be. The hardest part of the job was that managers some times wouldn't work with our schedule very well and in result, cut hours."
good,"nice place to work without enough pay. they'll work around other schedules that you have with no confrontation, try to help out with personal life, etc."
good,Un buen lugar donde complementar trabajo/ estudios/ familia.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. However, they tend to hire their friends as managers despite their immaturity. They need to look for more professional people to manage and offer a higher salary to keep them around."
good,Me gusto mucho pero termine renunciando por los horarios
good,"Its decent and the coffee is good. The pay for the cost of living is low, but the job is simple and because it keeps you busy time seems to go by fast"
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. They offer insurance as long as you work a minimum of 20 hours a week. They also offer a ton of discounts and free things for the partners. You work at a fast pace constantly and have to keep calm during rushes. Some times you're short staffed.
good,"During my employment there, I enjoyed my time. The customers were great, and they challenged me with great drink selections customized exactly how they were requested. During my time, I built relationships with my customers, resulting in customer loyalty and increase in sales."
good,Overall I was happy with my job at Starbucks it had me occupied. I would always come in at 4 and leave at 10. Sports was the only thing that got in the way but besides that everything was good in fact because of sports I had to quit my job because my manager wasn’t tryna work my schedule out
good,Must be book savy to know the intricate details at Starbucks. I had a difficult tile learning Starbucks company policy. Rewards and stars are hard to implement.
good,At the champaign location the mamager was unable to offer me enough hours to maintain my daily living . But the environment was amazing and very fun to work at.
good,"I loved being a partner! I worked busy mornings before class, these early mornings allowed me to go to class and do homework in the afternoons while making a little cash. Some store managers are questionable."
good,"Working at Starbucks is definitely something a lot of people wish they could do! It is a fun, youthful, fast paced, educational and welcoming environment."
good,A typical day of work was a bit stressful at time since I had worked on the bar at the morning rush times everyday I was working. I learned a ton of knowledge on time management skills. Starbucks was an awesome company to work for.
good,Loved working there and would love to make a career or out of making coffee but it doesn't pay enough in Seattle. I worked in Longview when I started and our stores kicked butt! Eventually transferred to Bellingham WA and it was a sad joke how poorly those stores ran. Biggest complaint was a store shut down its lobby bar at noon and overworked whatever barista had to manage both lobby's and drive through drink orders until 10 pm. Lowering the quality of service across the board.
good,Definitely have to be very friendly and great with customers! Starbucks revolves around and values the way we treat our customers and coworkers! It is a lot to learn when first coming in
good,"Starbucks is an amazing company to work for with plenty of room for development and growth. However, because it is retail, the hours can be grueling and with a start time of 4:15am can be difficult to retain a work/life balance. As a manager, expect to be always on call."
good,"Very friendly environment , working in grand central I have meet all different people and learn so much more in the customer service field , this company has made me grow as a person ."
good,"Great Company Culture.  At store level it is a food industry job. "
good,"I have always said I loved being a barista more than any other job. I would be one now if I could make more money to support myself. When I first started with Starbucks, I didn't expect to enjoy it because it was corporate but ended up loving it so much!"
good,"Each day at Starbucks, work went by faster than anyone could have anticipated. We were always busy, always kept on our feet and always learning new recipes and applications. each item on the menu had its own origin and special characteristics- it truly was as though each barista was an artist. Each employee was treated fairly and everyone's thoughts and opinions were always taken into consideration."
good,"If you need a job to make rent and get food on the table, then go with Starbucks. The company offers health insurance to part time employees and all the coffee you can drink. Their management program is very competitive and if you show that you care and you want to advance with the company they will pour money and hours into making you the best manager you can be. This was never a forever job for myself, but it is for some people and if you take care of Starbucks, they will take care of you. Just be prepared to work for it."
good,Great place to work. Very fun atmosphere but can get busy and hectic at times. Fast paced environment. Competitive pay and great benefits. Free drinks!
good,This was a wonderful place to start working. I would have loved to stay there but I could not use my disability aides in that enviorment. It was a wonderful space to learn coworker communication
good,This job has been great but you need to know what you are getting yourself into with working here. Some people might say other tings but this job is was not bad it was just overwhelming.
good,"Starbucks has been a great company for me, but it is rapidly changing and maybe not for the better."
good,i was employed with starbucks for the better part of 5 years and i really enjoyed working there.  if you enjoy working with customers and talking to people its truly a great job. the only reason i left was the salary.  if you have an outgoing personality this is the job for you.  the hardest part of the job is probably being on your feet an entire shift.  the most enjoyable part of the job for me is getting to know the customers and regulars that come in.  the job is flexible scheduling so its a great opportunity for students or moms or anyone who only wants to work certain hours in the day. i love starbucks.
good,"Working with Starbucks over the last seven years, I have grown professionally and morally. Treating others with respect and dignity is, above all, the primary objective for Starbucks. "
good,"Learned new things about drinks including alternatives for certain heath issues. Well organized, and fun experience. Loved the people, the job and the customers."
good,"Working at Starbucks was extremely fun, I often go back every other week to visit. The pay and hours were extremely terrible for someone in need and didn't satisfy anything close to a living wage. I would recommend for someone looking for a first job or is graduating from school."
good,"A empresa te trata como um humano, realmente um Partner."
good,"A typical day is starting before the sun comes up setting up all pastry , meal and coffee products. The job is more intense then you think it is serving customers and keeping on task for the day . The hardest part is trying to keep up with the cleaning task and still provide excellent customer service."
good,"A typical day at work can go from slow to very fast paced. I enjoyed working for the company. I loved working with my Starbucks team. Building connections with the customers, being able provide a comfortable safe environment for new customers & new workers. My time at Starbucks help me work on my communication/people skills. It taught me how to work in a fast productive punctual pace. gave me the ambition to want to continue working with people. chasing my passion to get my foot into the beauty and fashion industry, to work for a company I Can grow with."
good,This has been my job so far. Surrounded by positive people and staff. It was nice seeing the same faces every day.  The hours were easy and we got money from tips every week which I loved. I liked getting a free drink or food item on days that I worked and I loved getting a pound of free coffee every week that I could send to my dad.
good,"Starbucks is usually very busy. If you can keep your cool when there are 20 people in the lobby and 10 cars in the drive thru; all while making drinks and completing orders, this is the job for you. Management can vary by store, but is usually pretty good. You become pretty close with your barista co-workers as you have to rely on each other a lot. Hardest part was keeping up with the demand of the sheer volume of people, but the best part was coming out on the other side of a rush that lasted 5 hours; covered in syrup, milk, and coffee and satisfied that you got through it."
good,"One of the stores I worked in was the best place I have ever worked. The employees were all like family. Unfortunately, I had to relocate to a different store, and the manager was not trained or experienced enough to lead."
good,Upper management needs improvement. They are consistently changing everything and then cutting our labor. Definitely not enough hours allotted to get our work requirements completed. Making it almost impossible for a manager to have a work/life balance.
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful place to work if you like a fast-paced environment with a steady and thorough work system, as Starbucks thrives on practicing systematic methods of working. I really enjoyed the fast-paced and busy environment, although stressful at times, it taught me about how to properly manage a stressful atmosphere, while still directly interacting with my team and customers. The leadership team was great as well, as they made it important for everyone to communicate clearly so we could be on the same page with our work duties. Overall a great experience, and would recommend it."
good,"I have truly enjoyed the experience I had working at Starbucks. My regular customers made working there a wonderful experience.  There was never a dull moment, it was fast paced but never overwhelming. I enjoyed the environment very much. Requesting time off could be difficult at times, our store had a policy in place stating only two partners could request a day off at a time, and partners would block out days off months in advance. Overall, it was a wonderful experience."
good,It was my favorite job. I was a manager and just wanted to move up to a district manager and they always hired externally for that position in my area and I believe that was a mistake.
good,"Starbucks was definitely one of the best jobs that I have had. From the work itself to the coworkers and managment that I was surround by, I really enjoyed being part of the team! Making the drinks was always the best part for me!"
good,"Busy, time management, cash management, barista skills, leadership skills, training skills. The list goes on."
good,"Working for Starbucks for as long as I have, should be evidence enough that it treats their partners well. I've formed a bond between the customers, co-workers, and the company overall that no other part time work can compare. "
good,"Lots of perks, free beverages on shift, one free food item, mark out one bag of coffee per week, decent pay and Tips, worst part is the entitled customers"
good,The environment is so welcoming for the customers and workers. It allows us all to bond and accomplish goals within the store. All of the drink options is what brings people in.
good,Starbucks is a great company but is very political. I would highly recommend this company for anyone looking to gain management and customer service experience.
good,It's a pretty straight forward job. You get to deal with some interesting people. I feel like I learned a lot about dealing with the general public and working on a team.
good,"This is a very fun place to work, pay isn't great but tips help. You work most holidays but some have early closing hours so it's okay. ......................."
good,Starbucks is an awesome place to work. You learn a lot and the team is usually good. There is a lot of support systems for the employees of starbucks. They provide a lot of benefits.
good,Since I was placed in a high volume store I usually had anywhere between 10 to 15 costumers at a time.  This typically happened in waves every 15 mins.  It was very satisfying to have repeat customers and see their faces light up when I was able to write their orders down right away and they did not have to wait very long.
good,"I enjoy working for Starbucks, I enjoy my co workers and feel like I am working with my friends. I have been able to make great connections with the customers while maintaining a professional environment."
good,"The job at Starbucks gives you a unique opportunity to meet with people, interact and get to know them. Its a an amazing customer service environment one can get."
good,I have worked here for awhile it a great job if your going to school they work well with students. its mostly cleaning and making drinks until peak hours where your hustling to keep the lines going. the most stressful thing is keeping the lines going. customers can be rude at times but other than that I love my job and co workers
good,Starbucks is the best food service of all the companies to work for. I would recommend working there to many people because of the atmosphere and the benefits.
good,Overall i think its safe to say that working at Starbucks is a fun yet tough place to work its not for everyone but you meet amazing people. Its busy.
good,"it wasnt to bad really. every day was the same thing pretty much it was hard at first but got easier the longer you work there, training took about 3 weeks"
good,"I had a wonderful experience while working for the company. There was a lot of room for growth, as well as opportunities to understand a different aspect of work."
good,"Overall I really enjoyed working at starbucks, the environment really grows you as a person to handle tough situations and the coworkers and coffee were excellent !"
good,Fun but often left alone. I liked working for Starbucks but would much rather work a Starbucks that's corporate and not owned by someone else. It's not super easy either but ... once you get the hang of it you are golden.
good,"I have been a Barista at my starbucks for 13 years.  I enjoy working at my store because the partners that works there are like family.  We work as a team and we get along really well.  Our manager is a huge influence to all of us.  I have taken a shift from other starbucks stores and to me, my store is like home."
good,"I genuinely loved working for them, and if I hadn't needed to relocate quickly, I would still be with them.  I cannot recommend Starbucks enough, as the companies I have been with since do not share the same sort of leadership and collaborative spirit."
good,Working at Starbucks allowed me to further my educations and be able to work at the same time. Definitely an experience I will never forget. Management was great and very understanding when finals came around.
good,"The work requires full attention in providing quality service to customers to ensure satisfaction. I learned how to be attentive on what the customer's needs. The culture, however, was a bit disappointing given that in our branch entails lack on professionalism."
good,"Starbucks taught me how to work smoothly and efficiently through an intense, fast-pace environment with over 1500 orders daily. I would definitely recommend Starbucks to any person my age."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo en esta empresa es muy bueno, debido a que se manejan con una gran calidad y todos son  tratados como una familia, sus prestaciones son buena, y el trabajo en general no se siente debido a que siempre estas en movimiento. Sin dudaes un buen trampolín para despegar."
good,"Not only do you get to work with amazing people, you get to meet new faces all the time and connect with them more than just as customers. There's opportunity working at Starbucks, especially at the stand alone Starbucks and being able to attend their university. There's a great mix of personality at each one and you can tell by just walking into that the atmosphere is so welcoming and friendly."
good,"The benefits were great, the pay could have matched what we endured better. Lots of stress in and out. I learned so much about being a leader. Great training and opportunities. I loved the job and would do it again, overall."
good,"It was an awesome job. The pay was ok but you do get weekly tips every Monday. The better the store does, the more tips you get. It does get busy depending where your store is at (mall, shopping center, airport)"
good,Typical day would consist of preps and crafting beverages for the customer along with cleaning the store at the end of the night. I was mainly in charge of the cleanliness of the store because I worked the later shift for the company. About five nights throughout the week I would be in charge of the cleanliness of the store. The culture is great. The other Baristas at that store are fun to work with and there is a strong sense of friendship amongst the Baristas. Management was ok. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that may be a bit overboard about their order not being correct. The most enjoyable part was talking to customers and establishing a few friendships with customers while working there.
good,"Management in California was great"
good,"I worked at Starbucks as a barista at Kroger Market Place in Pickerington, Ohio. I worked there for about 4 years and I truly enjoyed it! I know I will remember how to make drinks for the rest of my life!"
good,"Starbucks was alot of fun to work at. You learn alot about coffee, and all the different kinds of coffee. You can move up fast and sometimes they don't post positions so other people get the job. Once you move up into a supervisor role you are only making $1.00/hr more with double the responsibility"
good,"I typical day of work for me includes creating daily plans/goals. "
good,"For freshy after spm can join,learn new things ,new environment ,meet people and learn comunication skills.Learn work wit team and also learn marketing  in purchasing."
good,"great company that is driven by partner development with upward mobility and social conscious, providing benifits to all partners averaging 20 hour per week"
good,"it's a really great company with lots of great benefits, raises aren't enough to help, but they are OBSESSED with cutting labor. ruins moral of the team."
good,"I've worked for Starbucks for a little over two years. During this time I've worked at approximately six stores, but primarily only two. Starbucks as a company is fantastic. The benefits, discounts, Spotify Premium, etc are all great. However, the work can be stressful and the stores require a great deal of leadership and organization in order to run smoothly. Needless to say, I've worked at stores with poor leadership which in turn diminishes employee morale as well as beverage quality and consistency. Despite this, I've found that working at Starbucks has continued to be a rewarding experience even when my coworkers and management fall short."
good,"I enjoyed my experience working as a barista for Starbucks. I went on to be a bartender after my time spent with Starbucks company, and was able to apply what I learned making beverages at Starbucks to my mixologist techniques."
good,You either love it or hate it. Working there pays the bills of a starting college student. Hours and schedule are very flexible. Accommodating with taking your finals when it comes to your schedule.
good,"Starbucks was a wonderful place to work. Benefits include stock options, 10% discounts on all merchandise, a free drink on breaks and after shifts, and possible health insurance. It was a great atmosphere as long as your boss was competent. I became a shift supervisor within a year of working there and I made some life-long friends. I wouldn't recommend this as a long-term workplace unless you wish to move up into owning your own store or working for corporate."
good,It was a great place to work with the chance to meet some amazing people who are all very nice and seem to want to help you out.  The typical day is filled with fast paced creations and is very exciting and the customers are typically very nice.
good,Starbucks is a great company to work with if you are looking to start your experience in the workforce. You will learn how to work with a variety of people. Also you will learn how to work under pressure.
good,"This job can be stressful, customers are naive as best and entitled and cruel at worst. You really need to be able to let things slide off your back, and get a little luck with some supportive coworkers."
good,I have enjoyed my time at Startbucks from the very start of my career. I have transferred to different stores around my area purely to gain experience and have had a variety of managers all with different strengths. It does become difficult at times when you are not being used to your full potential or not being given the proper training.
good,"Depending on your store it could be stressful, I personally had a store with a cafe and drive it could be nerve-racking. You get to meet a lot of different people and gain a great amount of customer service experience."
good,"Very Flexible with College schedules "
good,Benefits were excellent. It is definitely a job for early risers. The corporate culture is excellent. they put a lot of effort into development and training.
good,"Fast paced and costumer oriented, but opportunities to grow if you are willing to do the work.  Great financial support if you want to go back to school."
good,"The pros of the job include the wonderful benefits, fun work environment.  The cons include constantly smelling like coffee and bad management."
good,The people I worked with made each day fun and exciting.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers who wouldn't have been happy no matter what.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. This job is a very good first job or job to start working at if you need a restart in life. Highly recommend working here
good,Starbucks was a fun and fast pace place to Work with alot of people and it always smelled so good and workers got as many drinks they wanted while working
good,Had a great experience working here. everything is very organized and the people I worked with were very friendly. never had a problem working here everything is just perfect
good,"This is such a fun uplifting job to have. Yes it is the ""basic"" place to work but the people are so king, everything is a team effort, and the perks are the discounts you get. It really teaches you cleanliness, how to handle different situations and you find friends in your workplace that you love."
good,I really enjoyed working here. I constantly got to interact with people and be a social butterfly. Some days were harder than others but I enjoyed every moment of working there. I received a better opportunity with better pay so I accepted it and moved on from here.
good,"I worked for approx. 6 months at Starbucks and made some great and lasting friendships there. I enjoyed the business of the job and the atmosphere. That being said, one of the managers I worked with was less than professional and drove away quite a substantial amount of both employees and customers.  I ended my work there when I returned to school that fall but would have stayed despite the commute if it had not been for that particular manager."
good,"Very thankful for the time I spent working for Starbucks! The company has great opportunities and benefits for employees, and many other helpful resources."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks would all depend on the day of the week. It wouldn't be as busy on a Monday than it would be on a Friday. Although id like to say that we were the location off the highway and had a drive-thru, so it was pretty convenient. I learned that team work makes the dream work & how to complete a task in  well manor of time, that is where i learned that time is valuable. My Manager was amazing. If you were looking to move up he was the one you could talk to about. He cared about his employees and is well respected by co-workers and customers. The hardest part of the job was being understaffed mostly all the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with co-workers who made the job fun and exciting. There would be times where I would check the schedule to see if my work best friend was working the same shift."
good,"Fast paced, enjoyable work environment.  Breaks are scheduled on time and are reasonably spaced.  Fifteen minutes every two hours and a half hour break every four hours."
good,"Stress free workplace, great manager, great co-workers and a really fun place to work. The hours are flexible which is really great because I'm a student."
good,"Starbucks started off as a rocky experience for me. However I ended up transferring to a reserve location and became a reserve barista , which was nothing short of an amazing experience."
good,"The job is not for everyone, however, if it is for you then the company is a great company to work for. The flexibility combined with the benefits makes the stress almost worth it."
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job especially working at a high paced store were morning rushes or in my store( times square) during the summer were all day rushes, just the feeling of knowing what you're doing and going with the flow of everything so easily."
good,"Working at Starbucks is stressful but fun environment.  The pace is fast and the customer interaction is 100% of job.  There is a lot to do on a daily shift, and the customer connection is always important."
good,"I loved Starbucks because it allowed you to grow with the company and within new positions. My manager before my last was very inadequate and disrespectful, but the company replaced her when they realized her staff was becoming overly stressed and depressed. I sometimes felt over worked but I love the affordable benefits."
good,great company bad run stores it would be better if your store could work better together pay is way to low for the stress people put you under the benefits are great you just cant afford the with pay you receive
good,At Starbucks I learned communications is key. I also learned people interoperate things differently. Everyone can be given the same instructions but interoperate the instructions differently.
good,The problem being that the management styles change and vary so much from one location to the next that it's almost impossible to maintain the standards that Starbucks sets in place for them.
good,"I work with customers on a daily basis. I help prepare beverages, and food. I talk with customers each day. I enjoy the interaction with others. This is a great company to work for."
good,It is rewarding to work here since management does take into account your hard work and achievements. I would recommend working her to others. Also the people working here tend to be friendly and positive.
good,"It is a usually fast paced environment with helpful co-workers and great customer service. I have learned some shift supervisor duties. Currently management is unprofessional but has been under better store managers in the past. The workplace is a fun and respectable environment, co-workers are helpful and always willing to learn and teach new employees. The hardest part of the jobs is standing for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with customers and making perfect drinks for the customers."
good,"Great fast paced environment which held you to high standards of cleaning and customer service. The hardest part of this job was having a bad management team which in turn means more work for those under them, unfair for those people since we had to work double time for people who barely worked at all."
good,"The mornings are pretty crazy but otherwise the job is pretty mellow, and not that hard. Think and work quickly, know that the customer is always right and, work well with the team that you have. Doing all of that will make the job great. Cool people, cool company, amazing benefits."
good,"Working at Starbucks, you're guaranteed to feel at home. Your coworkers become your family, your customers become your friends, and you'll quickly begin to look forward to your next shift. While it may seem like the job is all about making and serving coffee, there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes. From checking temperatures to ordering items for the store, there is always something to do. The hardest part of the job was making sure my team and I provided the best experience for our customers when we were understaffed.  What I enjoyed most while working for Starbucks was the high standard of cleanliness and established routines."
good,I learnt a lot from this job. Typical day is getting there early in the morning. Shift is busy in the morning. Lots of customers. You have to be on your feet and ready to go. it is really fast paced.
good,I loved the experience working at starbucks and enjoying the atmosphere. However there was some poor management issues. The fast pace environment is awesome.
good,"It’s a great place to work, Starbucks offers a lot of benefits to both their part-time and full-time employees. Great customer service skills is a must."
good,"Work is fun which helps boost morale and help provide excellent customer barista interaction, a great job for anyone who needs flexiable hours while providing full benefits at part time"
good,"While my role at Starbucks could be stressful, I enjoyed almost every minute of my experience with the company. Starbucks, during my tenure, was fiercely partner focused and rewarded results generously. In truth, had it not been for medical reasons, I believe I would still be with them."
good,Worked Starbucks through College. Great place to work and a great place to learn. Works schedule around school. Pretty flexible. Free coffee. Great place to work.
good,I worked at Starbucks for my first job and it was perfect. The training was done well so I never felt like I was lost. Pay was adequate for a teenager as well.
good,A job that gears you for your future in the minor ways to take knowledge and access bigger pictures later. I would not get to comfortable at a job like Starbucks because it could block your blesssings. For the over all it’s a work place and you have to make the best of it and know your worth
good,"Newer management needs to be trained better, but other than that I loved my job and took pride in what I did, and would look forward to working there again!"
good,A lot of growing opportunities if you wanted to move up in the company. Benefits are great. I work in a 24 hour location so the hours are flexible if needed. Fast-paced and a lot of teamwork is used between my coworkers and I. Definitely would recommend this as a job if you are looking.
good,I like working there. its a good jod with benefits. a fast pass work environment with people that strive to make a work place better for you and the customer
good,"Primarily working for Drive Thru locations, I found that an average day is full of chaos from the constant lines and possible incorrect orders. Most days I would find that the staffing wasn't accurate and labor would be short for how busy it was, but understanding customers and energetic partners made up for the stressful environment. It's not always a guarantee that you'll have the best store manager, but the partners that you work alongside make the work environment more bearable and enjoyable. One of the hardest parts of my job was ensuring that my shift was properly staffed if there was a staffing issue or if someone called out sick. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to connect with customers and getting to know customers on a personal level."
good,When I first  at starbucks the job was fun. You learned about coffee and a great network. I met a lot of great people. However the atmosphere began to change at that store. It stopped being fun
good,"Coworkers are usually cooperative and nice. "
good,Good company to work for. You will always be busy making drinks and handling customers. Need to be able to multi task and not get nervous under pressure. Great place to work if you have good management. Pay is a bit low.
good,"I worked in a high volume store, so shifts are always fast paced and fun! However, we had a problem with people leaving soon after hire, due to the high stress environment and volume of foot traffic through the store. It can be hard to keep up with, but the human connections we make are priceless!"
good,"I loved my two years at Starbucks - It was so great company and culture to work for. I always had so much fun but also worked very hard."
good,Working at Starbucks is a fun quick paced environment. The teams are usually great and the experience and training you get is amazing. The only issues that arise are due to the staff and their ability to either meld or separate. If they can't be a team it can make any job experience difficult to enjoy.
good,"I am leaving starbucks, though I love working for the company. Unfortunately, the benefits and pay are not good enough to keep me as an employee. I highly recomend this job"
good,Is overall a fun place to work at depending on your location and management. The staff is always friendly and informative. If you’re looking for a great company to get your feet wet in the customer service industry than Starbucks is the best.
good,"Great experience, so many perks and rewards. great part time job and or full time job. Lots of room for advancement. community type of job. Can be a great Career."
good,"I love working at Starbucks. I just have to pick up hours from other stores so that gets annoying. However, you have to take your good with your bad. I just hope that I will be considered for a shift position soon."
good,"Working for Starbucks was a great experience when I started out in Tuscaloosa, AL.  I moved down to Mobile to be near my kids and the only thing that made everything sour was the management.  My last manager showed favoritism towards his female shift leaders and females in general.  My female shift leader screamed at me to ""quit f***ing with her"" when we've been joking around throughout the day.  I called her a b**** for it and that biased manager threatened to fire me but only gave her a write up.  Said I had issues for calling a woman that word.  I thought it best to resign from that job and pursue other things.  But that's not a manager I would want to work for."
good,Would recommend this employer to anyone who is looking for a solid foundation with a company that treats it partners as family for someone who wants to work for a diverse corporation
good,"Starbucks, as a company is great. Lots of benefits and one of the few companies to offer full benefits to part time worker. My problem is, I'm not a part time worker. I couldn't afford to pay the rent with this job. "
good,"I was really fantastic to work at Starbucks. I had the opportunity to learn about everything, make an outstanding beverage, customer service, and multi-skills."
good,I've enjoyed my time at Starbucks. The company has allow helped me when I needed it and I am grateful full for everything that I have learned while being a Shift Supervisor.
good,"A regular day at work during the mornings a pretty busy but as the day go by it gets slower. At a corporate store you’re busy all day. Working there you learn how to make different types of coffee, you learn (if you do not have it already) Customer service."
good,"A typical day at Starbucks included serving customers, using registers, greeting customers. Also prepared beverages and pastries according to customer wishes."
good,I have made some of my best friends at Starbucks. The Work atmosphere is that of a family more than a group of coworkers. The training period is never enough but by a month or two you’re capable of everything needed to be successful at your job. Overall a great company.
good,"So long as you have a good manager, you'll have a strong relation with a company who cares about their clientele and workers. Especially great for college students."
good,Working at Starbucks was just what I needed to get through college. My husband and I both worked there for a time. The hours are flexible and the experience really sets you up for the real world.
good,"Working at Starbucks is great as long as you are able to continuously move and work. The only problem with the company is that they insist on hiring so many people, partners hours get cut more and more. In the span of a 6 months I went from 38 hours a week to 22 hours. Great part time job, if anything."
good,"I enjoy working for starbucks, i just want more pay honestly. I like the people i work with and the management i just need more. It is very fast pace and can get overwhelming but if you enjoy that type of work this is your place to be."
good,The culture was fun and active. Great place that keeps you both on your feet and involved in your Starbucks community. Benefits were great to have so I feel grateful to have had what was offered to me.Manager was new so she made the work environment a bit tense. I'm sure she will improve over time.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. A typical day was always knowing your customers, what time they were coming in, and what they were going to order. Our customers loved that and thats what made them loyal to us. I actually looked forward into going to work on a daily basis. It was my second home where i had the best team to work with and where i could be me and no one was there to judge. Management was great because they were actually humans before anything and what i mean by that is that they actually took the time to listen to their employees and tried everything to help them out. The hardest part of the job was me having to depart from it. The most enjoyable part of the job was that no matter how busy we got at any given day, was that my team and i always knew how to keep our cool, we always kept a smile and always worked together to get things done in a timely fashion, and that was everyone from barista to shifts to store manager, all titles were set aside. Starbucks was the best job Ive ever had thus far! To be a partner was amazing!"
good,"Working at Starbucks can be good or bad depending on your team. If you r coworkers are great, work is great but that is applicable amongst anywhere. The benefits are amazing and they are flexible with school schedules so that is a big bonus. It can be a toxic environment though. so you must have a thick skin to stay for a long time."
good,"Starbucks is great for the community and service awareness,offering opportunity for clean up of shore lines and beaches.  I enjoyed working at Starbucks."
good,Fast paced but fun environment to work in. I always worked the early shift and was done by 3 pm and loved it! Wonderful regular customers and great management!
good,"I was blessed to have worked at the Starbucks that I did. The staff was amazing and I am still friends with all of them today! My manager was extremely knowledgeable, fair, and caring. Everyday was awesome."
good,"I loved being a manager for Starbucks, the customers were awesome! If there was a bad experience there were always 16 more good experiences to even it out."
good,"Fast paced environment that provides the opportunity to build character and advance to a supervisor position. Can be stressful based on the store you work at. Great benefits from the company, but pay could be higher."
good,"Productive and fun work place , great customer service, I really enjoy working and feel like I do change in my neighborhood that makes every customer happy  by giving the perfect cup of coffee."
good,"I love working here, but if you can't meet goals, then it's not the job for you.  Also, you get as much free coffee and other drinks as you want! Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee!"
good,Good work environment with overall respect from employer.  Access to benefits an emphasis in the company that is a definite plus.  Stress of job & constant turnover can be a detriment but would recommend to anyone.
good,"Great benefits at affordable rates, excellent tuition reimbursement program, annual stock gifts for each year of employment regardless of position. Generally a great place to work. Management and senior management are typically promoted from within, so there is great opportunity for advancement. Occasionally, there are outside hires into management roles and it can create issues while they adapt to the Starbucks culture."
good,"Great place to work! Tough Competition Getting In. Worth it if you can make it. Learned new things regularly. Great Culture atmosphere, open inviting desk spaces. Hard to find parking if you drive in during Business hours. Free Coffee, Espresso, Tea, Water in all break rooms."
good,Good place to work weather you are starting out or a seasoned worker. Hours are very flexible. Management fair and nice. Learn how different types of coffee taste and blend with different types of pastries.
good,"Recommend job for people fresh out of high school . Offers alot of things that can be beneficial for someone younger. Very fun job to have , especially if you are a people person."
good,Starbucks in the Falls is very busy and you are introduced to many different cultures. It is fast paced and a very fun atmosphere. However if you are looking to get holidays off it is a very slim chance as it is considered a tourist job in the area I worked in so you do not get American or Canadian holidays off of work.
good,"Starbucks is not a place for people looking to make a quick buck, you need a passion and a drive for customer service along with coffee to be successful in this environment."
good,I really enjoyed working on the arizona state campus location of starbucks. I loved my team and my manager was very detail orientated and wanted the best for her team.
good,Loved every second of my Starbucks employment. Ended up leaving due to differences with coworkers but I would go back in a heart beat if staff were changed.
good,Fast paced but fun and enjoyable work environment. Must be able to follow orders and able to multi task. Keep a calm cool head and have great customer skills
good,"This is an excellent company to work for. They sincerely care about the environment and their customers. I am currently getting my BS in Human Resources Management and the only reason I am leaving this company is to obtain a position related to my degree, as well as one that is financially better for my family."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced, i would have to make multiple drinks within a certain amount of time which i did. Working at starbucks has helped me improve more in my ability to work fast and multitask without an error.The management was great because the manger always made every employee was happy. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers and always making sure they were pleased with their beverages."
good,"les équipes sont dynamiques et agréables au quotidien. il y'a beaucoup d'entraide."
good,depending in the area that you are in and how you perform to your numbers you can be view as and excellent employee or as the black sheep of the family.
good,"Fun to work at! Customers were nice, manager was good, coworkers were fun. Only problem was keeping a manager for a good amount of time! Pay was good, sometimes wouldn't get noticed with the stuff you do."
good,It's a great place to work for to gain experience in customer service! The customers are friendly and most of them come in a lot and you tend to start really cool relationships with them. The job is good it just helps when you work with great people.
good,"out of all jobs this one was fun, it can be demanding at times but it is an enjoyable job. it does take a lot to move up for this company, its is achievable though."
good,"overall, starbucks is a great company to work for. I really enjoyed being a barista. It definitely has its challenges, the fast pace can be enjoyable to some and difficult for others. There is always opportunity for advancement within the company, and if you don't click well at one location it is easy to transfer to a different location."
good,"Good workplace, "
good,"Starbucks is in general a great company to work for. They have excellent benefits and are extremely liberal which I love! If the management is having issues however, it can be a nightmare. I lived through transition of several general managers who couldn't seem to get a handle on the location as it was so high volume. The hardest part of the job is being open on holidays and having a less than happy manager. If your manager is eager and experienced in their position the job is amazing!"
good,I loved working with Starbucks. It was very easy going and relaxed. I liked working in the morning and getting customers days started with their perfect cup of coffee. Everyone I worked with was awesome and always worked as a team. I really enjoyed Starbucks. I also liked that they are typically involved in their community; that says a lot about a company.
good,"Starbucks was a great learning experience. The company knows how to treat it's employees as well as customers, they offer great opportunities as well as benefits. Typical work days at my high-volume store was very fast paced, hands-on work. Most aspects of management were conducted properly leaving a decent workplace culture. Hardest part of the job is dealing with lazy employees or careless managers. Most enjoyable part is definitely the personal connection you make with each customer & trying all the yummy drinks."
good,been there for almost 2 yrs and its a great experience. I think the best thing about the job is the customers who u get to see everyday. benefits are good are well at Starbucks. Not many jobs have really good benefits but they do.
good,"pay could be better overall and i wish there were more chances and opportunities to advance my career. people that i have worked with at multiple stores are great, customer service oriented and i love meeting and talking with people. less drama than other jobs i have had, although sometimes other coworkers moods affect work"
good,"Very fast paced, can be extremely fun and entertaining, team player attitude a must, customer service oriented, must love mornings, talking to strangers, and being a fan of coffee wouldn't hurt."
good,It's Starbucks. You couldn't ask any better for a college student. Excellent benefits for long standing employees. free drinks and a free food item a day. Decent customers.
good,I work at a licensed Starbucks inside a grocery store. I enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and the ability to continually learn. I love my managers and coworkers!
good,"prepared coffee drinks by following recipes and preparation techniques. Generated revenue by attracting new customers; defined new and expanding services/products. Sold products to customers in a courteous and friendly manner. Participated in all sales promotions effectively and efficiently .Responded pro-actively to customer service situations .Completed accurate sales transactions with customers. Maintained a high standard of cleanliness throughout the facility.  I liked working for Starbucks, I learned a lot, and made lots of good experience."
good,"The store that I worked at had NO advancement opportunities, which sucked. They also were not very understanding of any illness', family emergencies or things like that. Other than that though I did enjoy working there, they had great benefits for employees, just gotta be able to be full time!"
good,"I had a lot of fun working for Starbucks, I loved being a valued member of a team. Benefits and special programs were abundant. It was hard work but very rewarding."
good,Fue una experiencia muy padre porque adquirí experiencia
good,"Very good place for work with learning and make carrier in this organization."
good,I've worked every shift in Starbucks and the best one for me was the morning shift. Learned a lot about coffee and where it comes from and the taste. With management some were good and some were horrible. Workplace culture is simple and easy if you know how to follow directions. Hardest part was the mornings when some of the machines would act up and the most enjoyable part was having a nice work and life balance.
good,"Sensacional, equipe maravilhosa, gerencia e lideres super competentes, sempre tornando seus empregados bons profissionais agregando muito na empresa."
good,"Starbucks is a hit or miss for a lot of people. Either you love it or you hate it. Starbucks is great company to work for, but sadly, I had a terrible store manager. After a year and five months I tried to transfer stores but she denied my request and wrote me up for being three minutes late two months ago. Although Starbucks is great, it's even better when you work with a good team and they're definitely out there. You just gotta find them."
good,I really enjoyed working at Starbucks and I felt very good about handling the everyday demands.  It was interesting learning the processes and how to make different coffees/drinks.
good,A typical day working is taking orders dealing with customers making bevrages to their liking and giving the best customer service experience  but can get hectic with customer rush hours
good,"I learned how to multitask on a whole different level and to be patient and accommodating in the best way possible, Management was great. I enjoyed working there for over a year."
good,"productive and fun work place, every day has a new challenge and learning. I learned to be independent in everything we do,, be genuine with my co-barista especially with our customers, my work place is my 3rd home. The hardest part of my job is having a difficulty with some of our customer specially they become demanding. The most enjoyable part of my job is i gain friends, i become more productive, i'm ready to learn a new thing, i met those people whose very down to earth and fun to be with and i become Partner of the Quarter for the 2nd time."
good,"Great co-workers, with great team work, it was a fun environment working with them and serving the customers, making handcraft drinks were fun and people were pleasant"
good,"I love my job. I honestly enjoy and look forward to coming into work and seeing my regular customers, making their beverages, and getting to know all my fellow partners. It is a great place to grow your communication and people skills fairly quickly if you want it badly enough. The roughest part of the job is probably when we are short staffed and it is a peak hour. Other than that, I wouldn't say anything else about the job is honestly that difficult!"
good,I do love working for Starbucks. I think that they should hire more from within with inters. As I am taking Public Relations I really would love the opportunity to 'help a company and stay within the same company but have not seen it yet.
good,"Was a good place to work. A lot of hard manual labor. Management was ok but absent a lot. The employees and customers were fun."
good,A typical day at work involves a lot of standing and sometimes heavy lifeting. Customer service and attention to detail is critical here. Management is sometimes difficult to work with and most times you may not work the your specified desired area. It's vital to be concise with management about availability and scheduling conflicts. The hardest part of the job is keeping the workplace clean and functional. Starbucks is keen on updating beverages and new deals at a moment's notice so you must be prepared. The most enjoyable part of the job is your coworker relationships and customer relationships.
good,Management isn't always the best and pay isn't as high for the amount of duties and work related stress that occurs. Been in Starbucks for as long as I can remember and opportunities are not given to the people who deserve it.
good,Loved it but it was very stressful. The management was was great and so was making the drinks but the job and dealing with customers and the pace can get to being a little overwhelming
good,This job gives you a lot of opportunities. Its gives you a chance to go back to college for free. It gives you the hours you need. If you are pregnant or hurt it pays your leave.
good,"While the customers can be a bit cold, the company itself is a fun and encouraging environment.  If you work here, be ready to have daily challenges with a crew and corporate presence that both want you to succeed."
good,management is going through a rough spot at the moment great company to work for as far as benefits are concerned. healthy environment if not in management
good,"Every manager is different, but I have an amazing manager in Ladera Ranch, CA. I feel supported in my journey with Starbucks and love my co-workers! I'm always excited to come to work."
good,Schedules plus fun work environment. Very good managers that are always willing to help out when needed.  Co-workers are very good to work with and are always team players.
good,"Awesome company to work for, team is always happy and ready to work. The team work and customer service you get and are able to give from this environment is amazing."
good,"As my first job, I like to say Starbucks taught me work ethic. There is a way for everything to be done which makes it an overall easy job. It does take practice and studying to learn the drinks. The hardest part  of the job where the early hours."
good,"The culture is fantastic, caring, transparent."
good,"Overall, working at Starbucks is like working with your family. There is a great comradery and companionship involved from the day to day. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers along with your coworkers. Starbucks also provides wonderful benefits and schedules so that you can work easily and also have fun."
good,"It was fun working there. Has a chance for growth."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. They take care of their employees and make it a fun environment to work in. The only downside to working here is how often they cut hours, but other than that this is a great job."
good,I worked the early morning shift. I did like the job. Very good training. Good pay. I worked outside the gate and I enjoyed the slower pace. Very good tips you meet all different types of people.
good,"The endless count of benefits Starbucks provides its employees is beyond generous. As a part time employee, I am eligible for 100% coverage of any benefit they have. Education, healthcare, discounts, perks, stock, and 401k are just a few to mention."
good,"It became a healthy balance between life and work, but I simply didn't get paid enough to make ends meet. I love everything about working there, it's fun and supportive."
good,"The hardest part of the job is getting along in the work place with all different personality types. There is a lot of apologizing because of feelings hurt, crying, etc."
good,"Its a lovely place to work in. "
good,"Starbucks is the most amazing company with nothing but the best intentions especially when it came to the partners working. Customer experience was also a number one goal, nothing but the best was consistently provided on a day to day basis."
good,"Working on the drive through, tills and also making drinks gave me a good perspective of what a hard working job is like. The hardest part of the job was being able to fit it around my social/educational life as it had long hours."
good,"In the customer service industry you work with people from every walk of life, some people are friendly others are rude. I enjoy creating inspired moments in each customer's day regardless of the attitude they came in with. I learned how happy customers become when you learn their name, their drink or both."
good,I work in a Busy environment so it's a good things we have always something to do. I learned a lot of thing from the basic to controll the situations under pressure.
good,"The staff was always very helpful. Lunch breaks were fairly long. Opening was a bit tough but once you get the hang of it, it becomes second nature. I don't really have anything bad to say about this job. It was a great learning experience that got me to my next job which was working at a more ""real"" cafe."
good,"I don't think working at a drive through starbucks is as good as working in a cafe. Sure it's more fast paced, the time goes by faster, the employees and customers are more energetic, but I honestly feel like the bosses always worry more about a faster window time than the quality of food and drinks. In the same way you can't rush a decent cheeseburger to completion you can't rush a perfect caramel macchiato. You can't rush a dry coconut cappucino. And you don't have the time to build the relationship with customers that really builds value in the store. Other than that, the company is an excellent one."
good,"Starbucks is an incredible company to work for whether your a part-time employee making money for school, or your working at Starbucks as a full time career, everyone in the company is extremely accommodating to your schedule as well as your future advancements in the company."
good,"Starbucks has been the best unintended job that I kept. The support for employees is exemplary, focus on self-growth is excellent. "
good,Since working in this specific Starbucks was a licensed one there were some issues with management from time to time as well as certain workers. Working there was great had good times with my co-workers although at time when we got new people there were some conflicts but overall a great place to work. Learned how to make over 50 different drinks thru out the years.
good,Got hired as full time barista. Management was great and so was my co-workers. Dealing with customers was most enjoyable and challenging at times.
good,If you cannot work under pressure then this is not the job for you. sometimes you may have to clean along with making coffee. you must have great customer service in this business
good,"This was a fast paced work environment that could get stressful but was generally just upbeat. Duties as a barista included product and recipe knowledge, cash handling and required an upbeat personality to present a pleasant and friendly atmosphere for customers. During slower periods ""house keeping"" was number one priority both in the front of the house- customer seating areas and back of the house- extra cleaning of floors, equipment, restocking. The hardest part of the job was the support position where the barista is on an 8 min cycle broken down to a 2 minute timer cycle per station location to maintain coffee, stocking supplies, trash and sanitizer rotations: 30 min on buckets 2 hour on equipment with 2 min to pull and replace all line equipment to maintain quanza health standards the process usually took 4 - 2 minute cycles to complete both lines and wash all dirty equipment for next sanitation rotation cycle. By far the hardest barista position with the most expectations."
good,They are very friendly and such a good work place make new friends and the job is very easy and productive. The airport is such a big environment to work in so it can get really busy at times and also they hours u go in are usually at 3 am in the morning so it could be tiring.
good,"el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno alegre y dinamico aprendes a se mas extrovertido y a desembolverte mejor por otro lado tambien aprendi a trabajar bien con los demas. la parte mas dificil del trabajo era cerrar la tienda ya que por el tipo de trabajo saliamos a la 1 am."
good,A typical day is fast paced with lots of things going on. Helping customers and making sure that the team is taken care of. The hardest part is not turning off the work when you leave as you are accountable to what happens when you are not there.
good,"Learned all about the world of coffee. Being patient and connecting with my customers. I worked the last shift of the day, so constant cleanliness was extremely important of each shift"
good,My experience with Target was nothing but pleasant.  The work environment was both motivating and progressive and I would do it all over again. Management was invested in the relationship with their staff.
good,"Amazing people, amazing customers, and amazing culture.  Starbucks has a way of making all employees within all tiers of management feel like they are special and are a key valuable component of the business/company."
good,"This job gives off positive vibes and has been my favorite job ever throughout an experience in any other jobs. The only thing that really grinds my gears are availability and moving up. it's a slow process and unless you are super close with managers, you really don't have a shot."
good,"This place is great to work for! it has great benifits and wonderfull people! It can get stressfu) but thats only when something gets thrown off like an espresso bar breaking down, my co workers are great so is my management staff they are all supportive when you need them and they're very great listeners working there I've learned how to create an assembly line AKA working together to create and hand out the final product to make us happy."
good,"I enjoy interacting with my team and with the customers. The company culture that is encouraged at Starbucks is conducive to this fun environment and helps each individual to grow to their potential and learn new skills and tasks. The processes and procedures at Starbucks help any employee handle most situations in a way that results in a desirable outcome for the company, the employee and most importantly the customer."
good,"learned how to properly manage money, how to manage employees in faced paced environment. How to handle irrate customers. Problem solving in busy environment."
good,"It can get very busy at times especially during a rush but it made me get used to working in a fast paced environment. Management was good, and my co workers were always great to work with."
good,Great Part time job. Great Benefits. Good Insurance. good environment. Great Experience and good company to work for.
good,"If you love people and coffee, this is the place for you. Early mornings and fast pace. You are always moving and multitasking. you are on your feet all day."
good,"Delivering legendary customer service to all customers by acting with a customer comes first attitude and connecting."
good,"A typical day at work would be to make and serve coffee and food to customers waiting for their flight and also to employees working at the airport."
good,"He tenido  la oportunidad de trabajar en una gran compañía, donde el compañerismo es admirable y el trabajo en equipo prima sobre los beneficios propios. En ese ambiente de trabajo, cada día es diferente, ya que tenemos clientes con diferentes perfiles y provenientes de diferentes paises. Lo mejor de todo, es ver ver a un cliente satisfecho que viene día tras día gracias al trato recibido. Por ello la fidelización en  esta compañía es un paso muy importante dentro de la venta directa."
good,"Depends on what bux you work at. I got lucky and my manager works great with my needs, which allows me to go to full time school and be a full time mother with a little work on the side. The benefits are great. The longer you work for bux, the more you will get in return. Its possible to move up, but you have to have the motivation to do so or else it wont happen. Work is always busy, but its very fun."
good,"* A typical day at work consisted of maintaining a steady pace to ensure all orders were made in a timely manner, keeping the store clean and fully stocked."
good,"Environment is very fast pace. When I first started off at my store, i felt uncomfortable around certain employees because I was new. I felt like I was in their way and they made it very clear that I shouldn't be in their way and that I was a newbie. Great environment when it's fast pace because it makes time go by faster. A lot to learn."
good,"Super AG; Arbeit macht spass,Vorgesetzte sind vorbilder!!"
good,"Working as a barista was the greatest job to have while going to school. Flexible hours, great benefits, and all the coffee a college student could take. I enjoyed making drinks, and visiting with people! Co-workers were great! Store manager liked to micro manage, but that was the worst of it. It was a fun, and pretty easy job."
good,I enjoy the experience however sometimes this company cuts labor sharply in order to increase short term profits. I like inspiring others and being inspired by my team.
good,"I was a barista through college and the hours I worked made me able to balance work and College life. My supervisor was very reasonable, personable and made the workplace an enjoyable place."
good,I took a job at Starbucks to get the health care coverage they offer to parttimers. Well run company. Very organized and concerned for their employees' well-being. jg
good,"Un dia normal de trabajo podia tener 18 horas de jornada. Aprendi -además de a hacer café- a lidear con el trabajo bajo presión, al tiempo de cumplir estándares de franquicia. La gerencia era dinámica, juvenil y muy empatica. Mis colegas siempre hicieron el trabajo mas agradable. La parte mas difícil fue  soportar las jornadas laborales tan prolongadas. Lo que mas me gustó es que es una empresa muy divertida"
good,"Though I am not a coffee drinker working at Starbucks was fun. My local Starbucks' customers were part of the family. We had regular customers. "
good,Fast work environment and solid hours. Sometimes people forget its just coffee and customers can be rude. Making Frappuccionos sucks.
good,"Learn a lot about making coffee and espresso drinks. Multitasking is a must when juggling orders, money and other responsibilities. Overall, a fun job with lots of benefits."
good,"working with Starbucks is fun. I learned how to work as part of a team, customer service, and I really enjoyed working with my co-workers."
good,At Starbucks you're always on the go! There's a good mix of people that work there as well as patrons. Starbucks does not discriminate and are very welcoming.
good,"very challenging but fun."
good,Good Flexible schedule while I attended school part- time. I enjoy working there because I get along well with everyone and the customers are very supportive of my academic career.
good,"This job was on campus and made it easy for me to keep up with classes, work, and extracurricular activities. The work environment was great and I learned to do the job easily."
good,fantastic company as a whole. store level however is difficult if someone desires to move up in the company.  benefits are the best it can be.
good,The company will really let you grow as individual and as part of the company. and its fun working here. and I have learned a lot from this company.
good,"I had a great time working for Starbucks and I would easily do it again, in a heart beat. I had amazing coworkers and a great support team. Only negative thing? Rude customers."
good,"I would start by counting into the safe and making change. I would also delegate responsibilities and direct my coworkers to make an enjoyable work environment! This job has given me ample opportunities to not only grow as a person but to help me with my customer service skills. As a shift manager, I am often given responsibilities that go above and beyond my intended job, however, I REALLY enjoy that! It makes me feel like I am a big part of my store! The hardest part of my job was the lack of consistency of my hours; very erratic and unwilling to work around everyone's schedules. The most enjoyable part is getting to see all of my regulars- making them a perfect cup of coffee- and also meeting all sorts of new people!"
good,Grandes chances de crescimento e aprendizados. Foco no treinamento continuo de seus funcionários e melhor atendimento aos cliente.
good,"I learned how to work well with a team, and how to coordinate the day's/night's responsibilities in order to achieve rewarding results. I loved that Target celebrated diversity while I was working there, and I believe that they still do now, which I still fully support! The company offers incredible benefits, but sometimes the hours were cut, mostly due to the ending of the holiday season. The hardest part about the job was occasionally working very early mornings, sometimes at 3am or 4am, which could be potentially difficult on the body and mind. Another difficult aspect of the job could be the training, depending on an experienced employee being willing to answer a new employee's questions and/or work through a particularly confusing floor-set (for new or current merchandise). I worked with a variety of hard working, determined people while at Target, and I think that was the most enjoyable part of the job. My co-workers were both inspiring and helped make the workplace a positive one."
good,"Starbucks is a good company to work for, although the hourly wage does leave a lot to be desired the company does provide you with stock that you can cash out and benefits kick in at 20hrs a week. "
good,"Very fast paced, and closely linked to community. Company cares for employers and the community. Great place to start as part time for students, or to grow in company if desired."
good,"This year marks yet another anniversary with a company I have come to love very much: the people are amazing, my store manager is committed, helpful, and flexible, and the work is rewarding, challenging, and fun, all at the same time."
good,"I work in a busy store. Constantly interacting with customers and building relationships. I was a partner for a year before I became a barista trainer, the hardest part of the job would be making sure every single customer is satisfied. People talk about bad experience before they relay good information but I try my best as employee to always smile and make sure our customers are satisfied. Working at Starbucks is not just about doing things to standard but having that interaction with each person that walks through our door. The most enjoyable part of the job, is seeing the customer happy with the beverage or food you prepared for them."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Starbucks. In a typical day a Barista usually helps stock and display products in a store. Works the register to help take coffee orders from customers. A Barista also learns how to make coffee and prepare drinks. A Barista always maintains a great attitude while working."
good,Meeting and greeting customers and having professional and friendly conversation. Making consistent and delicious beverages to recipe. The hardest part of the job was maybe switching out brews every 15 minutes especially during a rush. Other than that this has been my favorite job ive had and is super fun and rewarding
good,"Great company to work for, Starbucks understands if your employees our happy you will have great results."
good,"this was a great working place for me. i got to learn many skills such as being a positive force,serving drinks,working with other for the common goal"
good,From the forward thinking culture to the family friendly hours this is a great environment to apply your management skills.
good,"Starbucks was a fun. a typical day looked like getting prep done cleaning up, and setting up, preforming customer service quick movement with making beverages. clean up once rush is over. end of the shift stock is counted clean up is done. stock is counted up and handed out in the kiosk. milk is put away using FIFO."
good,"I was lucky with my location because my co-workers were really great and so were my customers! I really enjoyed the Customer Support role because I felt strongest and most valuable doing things like stocking, making sure the work space and dining areas were clean and organized, and also being able to have the flexibility to make myself available where I was needed was a wonderful feeling. I took a lot of pride in keeping the store together!"
good,"I really enjoy working with Starbucks. They are keen on having their employees advance within the system. They offer many perks to augment the minimum wage salary."
good,my typical day revolves around my new and regular customers. I enjoy showing them new things that they have yet to have their taste buds experience. It makes me happy to bring a smile on someone's face especially after having a hard day.
good,"I worked here for two and a half years, they promote very quickly not a hard job to move up in. I have met some very nice and interesting people here."
good,"I've had two completely different Starbucks experiences. My first experience was working for Starbucks in Target. I loved working there, my manager was awesome and most of the time it was pretty laid back. Sometimes you were required to work by yourself, ringing and preparing the beverages alone, which could be stressful at times when you have other responsibities like, closing or opening, and/or prepping and restocking during the day. You can not accept tips here but you do get paid more by the hour. My second experience was at a regular Starbucks, you get way more support here, its a lot more organized but it is a very fast-paced environment and there is always room for improvement, they expect a lot out of you and honestly, I don't think they get paid enough for the work load they are expected to do, but you do get tips here, which does help at times. There is room to grow in this department and they do have there stuff together. I loved the people I worked with, and at times we would have fun on the job as well."
good,"A great corporation to get experience. Starbucks is a wonderful company who helps teens and young adults get better aquatinted with the work field. While working with Starbucks I advanced quite quickly. I learned that working hard pays off and learned the value of quality of work. A typical day was making sure our lobby was a friendly and uplifting environment. I would make sure that our refrigerators were clean and running properly, our inventory was accurate and up to date, make sure the accuracy of all orders were correct, and ensure all team members were given breaks on time and dispersed correctly."
good,Good management and was able to move up in the company. culture of Starbucks was very good fun and and high energy. Would love to go back someday.
good,"Very fun work place, great people. long hours subsidized with the job  Under supervision, advise architects, borough landscape designers, engineers and other construction professionals on to the best practices for the"
good,Each day was slightly different in what was required of me however I was expected to deliver world class customer service while delivering premium products on every shift. I would always arrive half an hour early to make sure I was completely prepared for the following shift. I learned many interpersonal skills such as how to interact with colleagues and customers effectivley.
good,"This was a great environment to work in and there was a lot of room to express creativity, learn, and give to the community.  "
good,"A great company to work for with a stellar product that I thoroughly believed in.  There seemed to be a continual evolution to balance customer needs and partner productivity without putting an undue burden on the partner.  The team environment was what made the job enjoyable.  One of the benefits of working for Starbucks was the company view on product knowledge and the ability for the partners to truly know everything that could be known about the products we sold.  Hard work is definitely rewarded and the benefits available to the partners were outstanding.  On a daily basis the customer interactions are really what make the job enjoyable. Given my educational aspirations staying with the company was not possible.  I couldn't seem to find a way to make a geology degree mesh with a future with Starbucks.  Otherwise I would have stayed on because I truly enjoyed what I did, but supporting a family of 4 on my annual salary wasn't possible without advancement and that is where the conflict arose with my education.  A major plus was the ability I had to work around my school schedule."
good,"Starbucks is an excellent job for part time employees. They offer a great benefit package, but really could raise their rage rates."
good,"Delivered legendary customer service; maintained calm demeanor during periods of high volume or large events; anticipated customer and store needs; assisted with new partner training; performed in accordance to operational and procedural policies; responsibilities included cash handling; maintained a clean and organized workspace; followed all health, safety and sanitation guidelines"
good,"Starbucks has high standards for it's product, service, and partners. A Barista or partner is the back bone of this company. Creating an environment that not only serves, but genuinely connects with customers is an unique challenge. "
good,"A typical day at work would be clocking in and prepping drink syrups ad espresso machines before opening, after we would do inventory on the morning shipment. As soon as we opened we had clients waiting outside. I was moderate client flow during opening but as soon as it hit 10 am we could be extremely busy. e were always on our toes and multi-tasking the entire time. Management was really nice, fair, and flexible. Specially for those in school. The hardest part of he job was being able to move around very much because the area was so small and there was so many of us. I would of loved to stay at this job longer if pay was more reasonable and if they would of offered me a full-time job. There was times where they sent me home 2 hours after being at work because out labor hours were so little and so many people. I love being on my feet and always doing something so I enjoyed the fast paces and friendly environment."
good,Always busy and fun.  Meet new people and make friends.  Never a dull moment and room to advance and improve.  The company is willing to work with you on schedules and goals
good,"I love being able to connect and create relationships with customers and partners on a daily basis. I enjoy working with my partners and being able to connect with customers while giving them extraordinary customer service that keeps them coming back. This job has taught me how to communicate on so many different levels, to be able to read and help partners with their learning styles and how to overcome any obstacles that get in their way by navigating through different channels."
good,It was very fun and busy. Best first job ever. Mangers kinda were awful but it was what it was. I loved who I worked with and it was a great experience.
good,I always enjoyed coming to work at this location and I loved making coffee. The management was great and they really took care of everybody. The job can be stressful at times though because it is a very high traffic location and it's very structured.
good,"A typical day at work, I would go straight to see what position I work at that certain day. There are multiple positions to work: cold bar, hot bar, drive thru, register in cafe, and customer support. What I've learned from Starbucks is how to work customer service and to manage my time wisely as a student worker. My co workers and I have learned to communicate in situations where we are working under pressure and we are short staffed. Regardless of that, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know many people and seeing regulars."
good,"Working for Starbucks has been an enjoyable experience. My particular manager does everything she can to make it a great experience, working around my schedule and allowing for days off whenever she can. There is little room for advance if your preferred schedule doesn't fit with the needed hourly availability for a supervisor position however, and I have seen newer employees I have trained (and not gotten a bonus in compensation for) move up in rank over myself. Also when you work with the same people and see the same people every day it is hard to not make connections, however when those connections are strained it can make for a very unpleasant work experience."
good,The starbucks I worked at was always busy yet that didnt stop the store from performing amazingly well. Every customer walked out of there satisfied and content.
good,"I worked at a location on Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and this location was very busy especially in the morning and around lunch time. The line of customers wrapped around the store at times and required fast and precise service to demanding customers. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the cleanliness of the work space. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the interaction with the customers and being able to put a smile on their face. I loved the fact that there was always something that needed to be done. I believe it makes the day go by faster when you are constantly busy. If there was a down time, there was always something to be found that could be taken care of."
good,"A typical day consists of getting everything prepared before we open, which includes: making coffee, teas and setting up food and pastries. When we open, we serve customers coffee and pastries. During the slower times we will clean various places in the store, whether it be dusting, or washing dishes, or sweeping. We all work as a team, and do a wonderful job at serving our customers."
good,"Starbucks is great. The benefits are great. The culture is great. There really isn't much that's bad that I can say about Starbucks. The only thing is that, at my level, it is essentially food service, which means that it can be difficult to start and maintain a career at Starbucks."
good,Awesome place to work with tons of benefits. Very flexible scheduling and great opportunities for partners inside and outside of the workplace.
good,"My experience was great. The company had a laid back, yet serious, approach to growing the business, listened to staff and had a real democracy in decision making, I honestly felt like I had a voice."
good,"Starbucks is by far one of the best jobs I've ever had when it comes to loving what you do, and great people to work with. The hardest part of the job is that there isn't much pay for baristas when it's the front lines of the company. Every other part is wonderful."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, constant movement. I learn how to structure my day and how to move with direction. You have to think on your toes because nothing usually goes exactly as planned. Co-workers are in the zone when working and you more often than not don't want to get in each other way. Communication is always vital. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coffee."
good,"It's a fun environment, and great people.  The problem is the hours are very short and the advancement is not particularly good."
good,"make drinks and do costumer services all day, clean work area,, and also work as a cashier. i enjoy be working with people"
good,"Fueron tan sólo dos días de promoción, el ambiente de trabajo fue divertido, con gente joven y con ganas de trabajar y ganar dinero."
good,"I really Like to Work at Starbucks. I like the Job Culture and everything. I like to Make Coffee and Drinks. The thing that i like the most are the Seasonal drinks I really love to make them. and the special offers for the customer to make them, happy and give them free drinks after certain procedure i Just like these little little things   Overall I just want to say I really enjoy working in Starbucks. The"
good,"loved the workers there."
good,"I start my day reviewing the food sales and then forecasting the food order the next 2 days and then ordering them."
good,A day at work starts at 4:30am. The morning starts out slow and then picks up thru the morning until we are non stop busy. I love to be busy. My shift leaders are great at leading the team to run smooth thru a shift. The hardest part about my day is getting up at 3:30am to go to work. The most enjoyable part about my day is getting to know my customers and having a relationship with them on a dayly basis.
good,"- Daily customer interaction and sales "
good,"A typical day at work would be going in and making drinks for customers, while keeping the shop clean and neat."
good,"Fun customers and fun partners."
good,"Wahrhaftig tolles Kollegiales Umfeld, Hilfsbereites Kollegium, die Arbeit mit Kaffee bereitet einem jeden Tag aufs neue ein tolles Gefühl, die Kundenberatung und -bindung ist erstaunlich"
good,"I can truthfully say giving Starbucks a few of my years was one of the greatest experiences and fast pace environments i have ever worked in. Starting there as a Barista than advancing to a Team Lead Shift was great for me because the let me grow and eventually demonstrated my leadership skills by promoting me and giving me more responsibility. I decided to leave because I didn""t see them making me a store manager anytime soon. I really put in a lot of hardwork and long hours and i felt i deserved the opporunity of managing my own store successfully one day."
good,"I learned a lot about customer service while I was working at Starbucks such as how to improve the customer's experience. The management was great. I learned a lot from my store manager. My co-workers were probably the best part of working there. Everyone I worked with was very nice and helped me out whenever I needed help in every situation. The hardest part of the job was balancing school and work. I would usually wake up at 4am to get ready and get to work by 5am then go home around 1pm, eat lunch, then go to class from 3pm to 8pm. I was always tired in class and falling asleep. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see regular customers that come in everyday they always made my day better if it was really busy and stressful. And even when it wasn't busy, talking to them about how their day is going or how they spent their weekend just made my day."
good,you feel happy when there are lots of customers visiting your store and u try your best to work quicklyy and give them quick and best service possible
good,"A typical day at work would be me run all over the place trying to stock up nothings get prepped for the next person coming on the floor and the rush of people coming through, making it easier for the next shift. The most enjoyable part for working for Starbucks was the cool people you would meet and the co workers you would work with."
good,While at Starbucks I have learned what it takes to provide world class customer service.  I have also learned that it not only takes happy customers but also happy employees to run a successful business.  Starbucks is great to their people with the benefits that are provided and always giving them the tools for feed back about the day to day operations.  They also provide the opportunity for internal growth.
good,"One of the top employers in Canada"
good,"The days are busy, I learned a lot about drinks, the management at the time was unavailable, we had people come in from bigger cities, until we got our new permanent manager. All of my co-workers were awesome. "
good,"Fun customers "
good,"My job was an excellent learning opportunity and I developed my skills and experience in numerous different ways.I was then able to put this training into practice on a day-to-day basis."
good,Good company to work for you learn a lot in a short period of time and how to handle pressure my coworkers were amazing to work with the hardest part of my job was doing managers work when I was not supposed to be doing it
good,"-count register,organize product for the day, prep"
good,The workplace was always well managed. We were always provided with the equipment and supplies for a smooth shift.
good,"In my experience, after eight ongoing years at Starbucks Canada, I believe that Starbucks is an excellent place to work. The hours are sporadic but the people, benefits, and overall atmosphere of the job are great. I recommend the job to students and those looking for both part-time and full time work as there are always opportunities to work your way up in the company. Highly recommended!"
good,"A typical day in the life of Starbucks was buzzing with anything but nothing. With being a supervisor during my time there I would tell my partners ""if your not moving your not working!"" In my first years at Starbucks I was thankfully blessed with the BEST manager anyone could ask for. Her management skills were often compared to a drill Sargent due to her strict ways and consistent critiquing of your every move. You had to earn her respect and overall that attitude made a our team stronger at the end of the day. You were ALWAYS rewarded for your hard work and ability to improve. That type of environment keeps you motivated and passionate about your job. I'd have to say my favorite thing about working for Starbucks was my customers. Being with the company for so long I kinda developed a fan base. And that goes both ways! I felt like I was apart of my community! -Good times."
good,"A typical day at work, as a shift supervisor, consists of assessing the staff, and being able to problem solve, and delegate tasks. Coaching staff, as to Starbucks core values in order to provide consistent quality service for the customer. Have to be able to adapt to the different requirements and need of my staff, according to their capabilities When customers are dissatisfied being able to ameliorate the situation,and ultimately satisfy the customer's needs."
good,"Fun place to be at. "
good,"Very clean environme.nt, good pay, everything fresh and fast paste"
good,very fun and you can learn all types of stuff management is very helpful when you need it.
good,"O movimento da loja e muito intenso quase todos os dias. Aprendi a cuidar com mais carinho e atenção do próximo, a respeitar todas as diferenças e dificuldades, cada pessoa tem o seu tempo. A gerência poderia haver um pouco mais de objetividade nas ferramentas de trabalho. A parte mais difícil era conciliar a madrugada de inventário com a manhã de análises e questionamentos. A parte mais agradável era de preparar os cafés de todos os jeitos e interagir com a equipe e clientes."
good,"Store Level Management 05/00-07/02"
good,"Starbucks is definitely one of the most interesting and friendliest places I've ever worked at. The day to day customer interactions make you feel like you are a part of their family sometimes, or at least close friends. The work is typically fast paced and sometimes tedious, but its only for a short time. Everyone of my coworkers is like a gear in a watch, everyone is there for a reason. Each position must be filled in order for the orders to go smoothly from order to handing the delicately handcrafted beverage to its rightful customer."
good,"Had fun with the crew while working, had stressful times nothing we couldn't handle."
good,"A typical day at my workplace consists of being there at 4:30 am to open the store with two others partners. i have to do cash handling, set out all registers, placing and receiving pastry order, stock product that came in, give breaks, place partners in positions, run the shift, coach and train partners, cash deposit and change orders."
good,"Friendly People, ability to communicate with customers and learn new coffee making techniques"
good,i loved working here and the environment was great there were a variety of different cultures and people here i learned the value of team work this was a job that i enjoyed showing up for work..
good,A typical day at Starbucks consisted of many personal conversations with our customers. We were usually the first people outside of work that would interact with and our job was to lessen the stress as much as possible. My co-workers were some of the best teammates I have ever had. We really worked as a unit to get things done. I would have to say the hardest part of this job was simply completing in-store duties and making sure someone was always readily available for the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to put a smile on someone's face and make their day that much brighter. Working for Starbucks taught me time management and improve on my customer relations.
good,"Busy, go-go-go, great coffee, didn't like my co-workers but we made it work. I enjoyed my very early mornings, learned a lot about coffee. Got to know regular customers and had their orders being prepared before they ordered"
good,"I great time and the people are nice, learn more about how they make their coffee and the different countries our coffee come. We learn the different ways our coffee taste and the man that started starbucks company"
good,"had to make hand crafted drinks. the customer were very friendly and nice. had to maintain health code conditions in store at all times, changed the garbage and creamers frequently. cleaned the bathrooms. restocked merchandise and pastry."
good,"A typical day at work will usually include many customers, and not enough time to get the behind-the-scene tasks done. I have learned how to multitask, and problem solve on my feet, and I can do it all professionally and with little stress. The management is very hands on with the daily tasks that need to be done, and they are always willing to teach. The partners at Starbucks are hard to label as the company values diversity. Each partner brings something unique to the table. I find that the hardest part to the job is the number of hours that I have to be on my feet. I have been with the company for over five years, and it is starting to wear me down physically. That being said, I still find the job extremely satisfying, as the customers are usually thankful for the service that they receive and they really enjoy our product."
good,"You have the opportunity to work in a fast paced and high energy work environment. You are expected to be efficient, pleasant and professional."
good,"A typical day at work involves stocking all the shelves with merchandise, greeting and conversating with customers who are either having a good or bad day. Making specific and unique drink orders that will satisfy our customers. I learned to interact with customers more, always keep a smile on your face sometimes thats what a customer needs when they are having a bad day. The management at that time was a tad bit difficult to deal with but tolerable, there were moments of unprofessionalism but overall not horrible. Co-workers were very professional. The hardest part was learning everything that needed to be done in order to get certain job done, the enjoyable part was meeting and interacting with different people and putting a smile on peoples faces when they were having a bad day."
good,"every shift started the same check in with the shift on duty, communicate what needed to be done, what had been done, who needed breaks, what prep needed to be made. After we had properly updated each other of what was going on, either we would make the shift change, when i would take over as the supervisor. After that it was all fun, making drinks, interracting with customers and making people smile."
good,"Starbucks is a great job. Its a job where you really do have alot of pride for what you do. Especially if you work on making drinks for customers. To handcraft a drink made specifically for a customer is pretty awesome in it self.  Job can be stressful at times, but after a while even the stress isn't that big of a deal. The interaction i have daily with customers is absolutely one of the best reasons to work there. You meet a lot of fun and interesting people."
good,Starbucks is a fun place to work provided you have a crew that can effectively work together as a team. They have great benefits and training.
good,"At Starbucks, one must manage time and high volume of sales in a calm and efficient fashion."
good,"Starbucks has to be the BEST company I have ever worked for. As a part-time or full-time employee, Starbucks makes all of it's benefits available to it's employees regardless of being part-time or full-time. At Starbucks I learned so much about coffee and tea culture and their respective histories. Starbucks actively kept all of it's employees informed on the companies policies and developments. The hardest part of the job was dealing with vandals, thieves, and solicitors within the store. I was extremely proud to work for Starbucks and to serve it's dedicated customers with a smile everyday."
good,"A typical day:"
good,This was a very fast paced place to work.  Daily smart goals are set and achieved.  Making a connection with customers was very fulfilling.  There is always a well trained management team at any Starbucks.
good,learned so much about my job and how to give the best customer service.
good,"I have learnt a lot working here. Working as a team , and be organised are some skills I have learnt. How to handle customers and care for one another."
good,I would constantly be busy which was a very good thing for me. I also loved the environment that I worked in because there were plenty of inviting coworkers. 
good,"As a Shift Supervisor at a high volume Starbucks cafe, my responsibilities included:"
good,You really get to know people and because of their loyalty you already know their order when they walk in the door.  I learned how to make all the beverages!  This made me very picky when I order my favorite Starbucks drink!  The co workers made the job fun and I found no part of the job difficult!
good,It was fun but you had to be on your A game. Health benefits were great for part time work. Great work for college students. free coffee!
good,"I learn how to deal with issue and how ,team work ,banking ,pay roll"
good,"A typical day at work could either be very slow and finding things to keep busy such as cleaning the store, stocking, dishes or very busy where you are rushing at the end of the night to get everything done on time. I learned how to handle working at a fast pace to get orders prepared for customers in a timely matter and have there order right and the way they wanted it. I loved all my coworkers and how close we were and the regular customers that would come everyday that I got to know very well also the environment of working in a coffee shop."
good,"Most of the time we were always busy but that's what made the job more exciting because we met so many people at school. Everyone would recognize us and are glad to see us because of the wonderful customer service. I learned to pace myself, be more patient and learned how to get out of the shell I was in when I first started. Management understood us all well and handled things correctly when needed. Hardest part of the job was when we had special offers and there would be a really big line with many cups on cue; it was overwhelming but I didn't let that stop me. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers and talking to them."
good,I loved working with this company. Great benefits and fast paced. I loved the customers.
good,"Having worked at Starbucks from 2003-2007 as a shift supervisor and able to return in 2011 when choosing to go to college. I believe that Starbucks did provide me with the best opportunities to develop myself into a great management level employee. The first round I was well trained and the resource material was readily available. I strived to advance, but being in a smaller town didn't see the opportunity to do so."
good,"I use my fast fun and friendly attitude to quickly get to the needs of the guest ,I pushed products on to the floor and helped guest find"
good,Its a great place to build relationships with patrons that tend to last beyond employment and people love it when you can read their minds.
good,"A typical day at work is long hours of standing, heavy lifting, teamwork, and customer service all at the same time."
good,"I developed relationships with customers through communication, education and providing exemplary customer service. Courteous, friendly, and helpful at all time."
good,"Starbucks is generally a great place to work. It provides a great arena to hone your customer service skills, and management are particularly understanding about working around your schedule, if you happen to be at university or engaged in other necessary activities."
good,"If you are an extrovert, this is an excellent job with great benefits for a part-time job, which makes the slightly lower pay completely worth it. There are few companies that exemplify their mission statement and Starbucks is always looking for the next way to create inspired moments in people's lives. I truly believe in this company as one of the most ethical and driven companies in the US."
good,Making coffee and tea beverages everyday was fun
good,"I've worked at several locations in Vancouver, BC. My rating for management overall.... This varies according to what location you go to. I believe the management training to be very good, and it really depends on the type of person being trained and whether they choose to line up their values with that of Starbucks. I believe it is easy to tell who believes what they are selling is a good product and who could care less. I personally enjoyed working there, and found the ""system"" to be fair and balanced."
good,Stsarbucks is a great company to work for as I have enjoyed my employment there for over 8 years. I am currently moving off the operations business and have been asked to go to Seattle Washington but am currently unable to relocate. the culture is upbeat and fun and the products are first class. The work life balance is changing as managers are required to work in the range of 50 hours per week to get everything completed. Coworkers are mostly positive and upbeat as they keep the interest of customer interactions very high. the hardest part of the job is the 300 mile district I was asked to cover as it required a lot of time traveling to and from my 11 restaurants. the most enjoyable part of the job has been the customer interactions and relationships with the partners and seeing others grow and develop.
good,Amazing place to start working. you learn alot from this place
good,"I learned while working here that giving the customer a positive experience keeps the customer happy, which then translates into all of the staff being happy as well. This is what makes Starbucks such a wonderful place to work at!"
good,Leuk en gezellig je leert zo ook veel andere mensen uit een heel ander cultuur te leren kennen en de lekkere coffie natuurlijk
good,"Prepared and served hot cold beverages such as coffee, espresso, blended coffees, and teas; described menu items to customers or suggested products that might be appealing; provided customers with product details including preparations techniques; served prepared foods; handled monetary transactions including cash, credit, and debit card purchases; ordered, received, and stocked supplies and retail products; checked temperature of freezers, refrigerators, and heating equipment to ensure proper working order; and cleaned and sanitized work areas, utensils, and equipment"
good,"This is probably the first actual job I've had where I really have fun at work! I work with great people, they always make the day go by faster. Even though the slower days sometimes drag."
good,You start everyday with a rush of customers getting many different kinds of drinks. Co-workers are different from each person. The hardest part is relaxing after making a row of drinks during a rush and realizing you still have more.
good,"Although the job is ONLY making coffee, Starbucks requires that the level of service and products to be provided is unparalelled. I enjoyed working at Starbucks and would work there for life because of the people that I had the chance to work with and the clientele that I met. I learned what patience was and how it is important in everday life. While Starbucks has less patience; in my experience, with your daily schedule and plans for life. Simply because; again in my experience, management would sometimes consider you less important if you would not work the less desireable shifts or refused to do a clopen (close then open) shift. The hardest part of the job was having someone behind your back and reminding you of things that needed to be done. I felt belittled but relized that this was making certain that drinks would be made the best possible way. The most enjoyable part of the job was definatly the co-workers. I have met some of the best people ever in my life. The diversification is outstanding but very memorable! Although there is alot of complaining, Starbucks helped devlop who I am today and feel that I would not have matured as quickly as I did without Starbucks."
good,Each day would be filled with customer interaction. I learned how to manage my time and improve my customer service skills. I enjoyed the management and people I worked with. The hardest part of this job was the fluctuating work schedule while in school. The most enjoyable part of this job was being a part of a positive work environment.
good,"This company will keep you on your toes! Whatever you learn, you better learn it quick because you will get left behind!!"
good,Starbuck's was a fun place to work and I loved sharing my knowledge of coffee with my clients. A typical day consisted of supervising a high volume store that also had a drive-through (it was essentially two stores in one). Everyday I held a coffee tasting with my co-workers so that they understood and were comfortable with the products they were selling.
good,"always something to do, but never stressful"
good,It's a great place to work but the politics can get in the way of advancement
good,Great opportunity to utilize customer service interaction and skills.
good,Starbucks has a great love and appreciation for their customer service aspect of the job. This job allows one to work along side different people and cross-brand teams which is very beneficial from a learning and growth perspective.
good,"Loved working at Starbucks and wish I could go back if I could. Everyone is so friendly, atmosphere is clean and fresh. Coffee was amazing!"
good,"I enjoyed working for starbucks for the past 5 years, Its a great job. Perfect for college students as they are very flexible."
good,Good Place to work as part of the in store management team. A great place to meed new and different kinds of people. I have had some very good interactions just by talking with customers.
good,"Great company to be part of. Very fast-paced environment which usually makes the day go by fast. Can be overwhelming at times and the training process is lengthy, but overall worth it, especially since they give health benefits to part-time employees as long as you work a minimum set of hours."
good,"fun work place, easy job, be friendly to the partners and it will go by smoothly! barely hard work. good for a starting job or side job! would recommend for anyone."
good,strongly recommended. i am very glad i have been a part of this company. hoping to working again here if opportinity given. it was ver nuce yo have worked for starbucks in the philippines and here in canada
good,"Consistently serves guests high-quality handcrafted beverages, provided training for trainees and seasoned coworkers. Heavy cash handling, use of ten-key touch to include cash system, in charge of Saturday shipment inventory."
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun and exciting, it has taught me a lot and prepared me for other jobs. What I learned at Starbucks has stayed with me for my other jobs. The environment was light and fun, never a dull moment."
good,It is a good environment to work with but in the philippines the wage is much smaller than other countries. Although the wage is above minimum in peso.
good,"Love this job, very nice and friendly. Management is great it is face paced yet we are still able to have a good time. Physically and mentally demanding"
good,This job is fast pased and upbeat. If you dont like a since of urgency this is not the job for you. Very welcoming to everyone. The time flies. Partners are always willing to help you out with further educating yourself in tasks and willing to help you with scheduling issues.
good,Everyday was different and the ability to move around in the company kept me assured I would always have a job. Great benefits and every store is different
good,"I worked at Starbucks with my best friend and my manager was also very kind and hard working. It was a great experience working with them and also forming a bond with the regular customers and memorizing their go to drinks. My most favorite part of working at Starbucks was mastering the handcrafted drinks and seeing the customers' reactions. Since I quit for school, I was able to get most of my heavy courses out of the way and now that my course load is lightening up, I would like to return to work!"
good,"Working at Starbucks is anything but easy. At times it can be hard to stay on top of all the tasks but the work load is made lighter by having a great team. Teamwork is a huge part of Starbucks culture. As partners, we all work together to make sure that everything runs smoothly during our shifts."
good,The store manager really does care about who you are and who you want to become and creating an environment where all are seen and heard. I love the aspect of making a personal connection with people and adding value to those we come into contact with.
good,"Good company with decent benefits, work around your availability for scheduling. Great flexibility on job placement, fast paced. Being able to multi-task is very important."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you need hour flexibility and just an overall positive environment. I've worked at two locations thus far and every partner has been super warm and a joy to work with. The Shifts and managers strive to make the workplace as comfortable as possible.
good,The general experience I had with the company was very pleasant. Perhaps it was just the location I was in at the time however the uppermanagament just seemed....money hungry.
good,Working at Starbucks was one of my favourite jobs. I loved the customer service aspect even when it was challenging to talk to people and make their drinks and drive thru drinks at the same time. Multi-tasking is an essential and being calm under stress and pressure is a must have.
good,"The diversity here is great, you get great benefits and they don't exclude based on race, color, how you identify, or gender. The hours are good and they work great with your schedule."
good,"Starbucks places a lot of emphasis in goal-setting and personal development of their employees. They devote a lot of resources to training partners and helping them develop over their time at the company, while also providing great benefits and a welcoming environment"
good,"Gran lugar para trabajar, excelente ambiente (no en caso de mi tienda) pero estuve de apoyo en otras y era muy totalamente direfente, pretsaciones muy buenas,buenos horarios, todo para la calidad de vida del empleado"
good,"Se trabaja bien, se aprende mucho y se gana bien, pero,  a medida que vas creciendo la demanda de tu tiempo en la tienda incrementa, lo que provoca desbalances en tus otras actividades."
good,"Yes, while Starbucks is a very high-stress job, they take care of their employees very well and it is super easy to form relationships there. You learn how to work with one another all while learning how to be able to keep yourself clear"
good,I learn everything in Starbucks from the store manager their culture is very beautiful they except everythingI like everything about the job just the always cutting my hours I didn’t like thatHardest part about the job was not being focus
good,"*cleaning and check expired date"
good,"Nice place to work, we learn a lot and work a lot! We don't stop all day, but it is a fun place to work. The place is always busy and it takes a lot of responsabilities."
good,The morning shift is my favorite if you like working fast pace. Everyone gets a specific responsibility and you stick with it because it can get really busy. Helps the time go by fast.
good,A typical work day started off with where you were working then to that position until you had your break to then find a new spot where you were working the rest of the day.
good,Starbucks was a very rewarding experience as it opened a new door to things I haven't seen. I learned a lot about coffee and how to interact with a lot different types of people. Its a great for a younger group of people.
good,"It's never a dull moment, even during slow days. There is always something someone can be doing. Management is great and they always want you to learn."
good,I enjoyed my time while I was there and learned a lot about coffee. some days kept you on your toes and others were at a more relaxed pace and you could take it someone easy.
good,"Good work, good people and good benefits, they care about you a lot and if you have any issues they are there to help, not a single day that I didn’t want to work with the group of people I worked with."
good,Working with great coworkers bring out the best in me. I love being around them as well as our customers. Working in a fast paced environment is fun and energizing. Being able to interact with customers is the best part because I learn something new everyday especially about another person.
good,Everyone had their own role and that was their focus during their shift. Created a command line that was very effective with each order. Each employee was enjoyable to work with.
good,"Working at Starbucks was fun, sure it was fast paced but the customers were great and I got to talk while to my manager and coworkers while I worked we got to know each other well and made us work even better together."
good,"Fun place to work. Its awesome getting to know regulars that come in. I like meeting new people, and having conversations daily with customers and coworkers."
good,I Love to connect with customer and feel young. The benefit is great. You can bring coffee back home every week. Also 1 food and drinking coffee per working day.
good,"A typical day in the life of a Starbucks shift supervisor:"
good,I enjoyed interacting with the customers and my fellow baristas. Learning how to make the beverages is a bit difficult in the beginning but fun once you've memorized them. Workplace benefits are great.
good,A typical day at Starbucks was really enjoying and put a smile on my face. I learned that if there is an issue with a customer be as responsible as you can. Make sure the customer is satisfied with their order.
good,"I love each store I've worked at is its own family of partners and customers, I can still go back to my old store and have customers talk to me for hours about how much they miss me. I love that Starbucks is really connected to the communities. The coffee is amazing and the benefits are great!"
good,"im usual the store opener so i prep all items needed to successfully start the day,  what i learned is that under pressure you should stay claim, it will allow to see things clearly to better handle the situation.the hardest part of the job i would say is when we are under staffed.My most enjoyable part as a partner is seeing the smile and appreciation from the customers"
good,"Super équipe, super clientèle, travail au top et polyvalent."
good,It’s a very fast pace environment that no matter how much computer training you do it won’t help you until you do it hands on. Overall a great experience.
good,Great management. Offered opportunity to learn new and different things always made open. Inky drawback is the commute but they are open about flexible schedules
good,"Everyday is different. Nothing typical young fast pace, inconsistency so you need to balance whatever you get thrown into. Hardest part of the job is learning all of the components of operations ( drinks etc; ) Main management is great and district great, some shift managers not so nice. Most enjoyable part of the job are the customers and you do learn a lot at least something new daily whether it be from a partner or a customer, the companies culture and values are what all companies should thrive on pay should be higher and professionalism should be reinforced with co-workers."
good,I began mu career with Starbucks when i was 22 years old. Started as a supervisor and worked my way up to A Stote manager position. During my nine year tenure I've learned a ton and grew so much personally and professionally! Amazing training and support. Great culture!
good,"Work environment is extremely fast paced, there's always something you can work on. Sometimes your team will be understaffed. You have to learn to quickly adapt and think in the moment. The people I have worked with are amazing. There's always a way to make work fun and enjoyable. The best part about the job is the learning about your customer base. Some customers love letting us create customized drinks for them to try something new."
good,This company is great to start off. Great management great learning skills with cash and customer service and multitasking. You learn how to deal with people in different situations.
good,Great job stability but not enough hours to make a living. Management is questionable store to store and corporate expects alot. New barista training has degraded.
good,promoting within the company is extraordinarily difficult it is easier to get hired on as management than to promote from within. that is my only issue with this comapny.
good,Its as a simple high school job. I enjoyed working with customers. I learned alot form working there. I also enjoyed all the coffee's and knowing about the variety.
good,"Mon avis sur Starbucks comme cliente, j'aime leurs boissons parce que c'est tout fait par les Batista, on peux faire de modification dans les boissons et choix de lait etc, les choix de gâteau les employés conseils bien, aussi et l'environnement est très agréable et tranquille."
good,"I loved my time as a barista! If the pay were hire i really believe i would want to serve coffee forever. I loved the fast pace work and the hands on training, I really felt set up here."
good,"Overall I made great friends working with Starbucks and the benefits are really what drove me to work there. I would suggest it to anyone. I was able to have health insurance, Spotify and college paid for."
good,"Excelente lugar para trabajar, buenas prestaciones y un ambiente de trabajo buenísimo"
good,"A very good place to work, I find they (the in-store staff) are very flexible with your needs and actively listen to your concerns. Expect to have a hard time learning all the drinks and their recipes. This is not a job where you can easily jump on right away, but it gets infinitely easier once you stick things out and learn how to do bar. I found my coworkers to be very patient and understanding."
good,"The work environment was really cool and all the employees were just as cool, and I really enjoyed being a member of that Starbucks team, and I would really recommend that job to anyone"
good,"My typical day of work is usually fun. I like being on bar and making drinks but it gets stressful when you have customers eyeing ya down and seeing if thats their drink whenever its for drive thru. The hardest part is probably making the drinks according to the customer but also dealing with them. The customers are great, but you never predict whenever they're going to snap at you or one of your baristas because they become impatient. Other than that it is great peoples skills, and you get to bond with your local neighbors."
good,highly recommend this job to any part-time job hires. its an amazing environment and keeps you on your toes constantly. Definitely a job for someone that likes to stay busy!
good,"Zadania w firmie Starbucks są zależne od pełnionej funkcji."
good,Challenging fast pace environment . Good benefits .Flexible hours convenient . Recommended for part time job for students great perks . Love working with happy productive hardworking coworkers and happy regular customers .  Enjoy working with customers  and great team.
good,"Thanks to the training at this job I have received great comments on the way I treat and work with people. They're all about customer service as well as harmony with co-workers, it is genuinely one of the best places to start your working career."
good,"I believe the management I worked for was okay, but could of improved. Years after I left, I saw how much other locations improved since my little sister was employed with them for 4 years."
good,"Se trabaja en equipo a diario y desarrollas un sentido de pro actividad, con un ambiente divertido y con muchas personas por conocer."
good,"Starbucks has always worked around my schedule, even hiring me as a supervisor while I was in school. I was never denied any time off request. The managers really make the moral. Out of the last 13 years, I had only two managers that were not good for the company."
good,I liked learning about coffee and tea making. Learning all types of combinations and adjusting to accommodate any customer requests was enjoyable. I was able to pick it up fairly quick due to the fast-paced work environment.
good,"A great workplace, people and benefits, but horrible pay. Always a positive environment even when busy, every store has its own manager so you either get lucky or not."
good,Starbucks has been so great to me because everyone has great energy when they are around people who are happy & love the smile of coffee in the morning
good,great place to meet awesome people. Great team. Lots of cleaning. Overall great company. Dealt with a few terrible managers but that got taken care of quickly.
good,"Great warm, welcoming culture. Training is very clear and planned. Part time benefits if you work 20 or more hours a week. Partner discounts and perks."
good,Always busy. You get to learn how to make fancy drinks. Management works with your schedule. Always having a good time. Great benefits. Interacting with customers is fun.
good,"Un buen lugar para trabajar, buenos amigos y buena empresa que da prestaciones más allá de las de ley."
good,Great opportunity!! Great company!! You can also advance quickly!! Lots of love and kindness to go around!! Loved the squad and the great customers!!!
good,Very inviting place to work with great employees and the atmosphere is great. Guaranteed to enjoy visiting a Starbucks and trying there pastries and drinks
good,"Good staff and great customers, face paced and reliable benefits! Great opportunity to build skills such as social skills, multitasking and cash management. Fun environment to be in"
good,"The Target Starbucks is a fast paced place to work that allows me to connect with customers daily.  Being a part of Target gives opportunities to work in other places within the store, which has allowed me to expand my skills in a retail and customer service setting."
good,Starbucks was a great place with great people to work with. There is a diversity among the employees and the customers. The customers were respectable as well as polite
good,"Working for Starbucks is extremely rewarding. The connections you make with customers, and having a positive team makes everyday worthwhile. A typical workday includes revolving around different positions to meet the needs of the store and the customers. While this can be a fast paced work environment, the reward comes from the empowering moments with customers and fellow Baristas."
good,"The people that Ive worked with in different Starbucks stores  have always been diverse , but for the better. The only thing that was similar was that the environment within each store still felt like a home away from home. Welcoming environment for not only the customers but for each and everyone one of our fellow barista."
good,Come to work as a barista if you enjoy a pretty chill environment I had fun at the job I would love if it paid just a bit more but it pays a lot more compared to some jobs
good,"It starts slow but builds. I love getting to know my customers and talking to my regulars every day. I work with a great team that makes me laugh and smile. We have daily and weekly goals that encourage us to push hard and take pride in the work we do as a team. Some days are hard and not all people are nice but at Starbucks, we ""kill them with kindness"" and ""smile and wave."""
good,"Good place to work, however in the division I was in there was limited growth. The management was good on-site, however corporate folks were a little out of touch. With a little education, they were able to function in our particular area fairly well."
good,"Starbucks was a very challenging job.  I worked a very early morning shift and was usually finished with my shift at 11;30am or so.  I loved having the afternoon off for personal time or to work a secondary job."
good,"In my experience, every Starbucks varies depending on management. it's best to ask other baristas at that store or local stores what they think about the store where you're applying.  The insurance is helpful, and the store I worked at had a really positive and helpful manager."
good,"I've worked at Starbucks collectively for almost five years and it's been great. It really is what you make it. Having fun coworkers and an involved, well-organized manager is a huge plus that doesn't always happen. I HIGHLY recommend transferring stores before quitting if you feel that you aren't getting what you're looking for out of it. It is a very fast paced job and can have quite a steep learning curve, but keep at it. About seven months to a year in is when I felt competent enough to perform my job, training lasts a few weeks. "
good,Great company great benefits and the customer are great especially when having a relationship but the hours can vary. At Starbucks you are learning a lot everyday. Starbucks is has all types of opportunities
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. They take care of their partners and create a very welcoming environment in which to grow. As with all food service and customer service jobs, it has it's difficulties but it's a safe and simple job. I was fortunate to have kind and organized managers, which really sets a good tone for the store."
good,"We face everyday fast-pace customer service to cater exclusively for Deloitte employees provide positive, upbeat and sense of relief from heir tiring and stress workplace while serve the best order of their coffee or pastries."
good,Starbucks has incredible benefits and workplace culture. You are able to get unlimited free drinks on your shift and one free food item each shift. It's a great place to work for students as well because managers will help work around your schedule.
good,"Starbucks is a great environment to work in. You get very close with partners and customers, it is like one huge family. I have never worked for another company that cares so much for their partners and customers like Starbucks does. The only thing I would change is the pay, a lot of the partners love Starbucks and would like to stay working for this company for a very long time but they have to leave because of pay.

good,Very patient with military and happy to hire military or future military. Great work environment and I thoroughly enjoyed my time as a barista. Just be prepared for stressful situations and long hours.

good,"Its a good job for someone looking for steady income and desires benefits and would like to work part-time. If you area creative, I wouldn't suggest this job but if you need to pay the bills then work it."
good,"I had a blast working for Starbucks."
good,"Starbucks is a FANTASTIC place to work, but you have to be ready. This is not regular retail, and it's important to know that corporate and the separate retail entities can be very different. Corporate cannot be consistent across all managers as they are individuals and can run their stores differently. It is important to make sure you like the vibe/energy you get from the store and crew during your interview experience (advice from my manager there), but also don't let one partner ruin your experience, ask to meet the manager if you're not satisfied with who you're talking to. They need you, more than you need them, it's gonna be YOUR job, make sure you're gonna be comfortable! "
good,"This is a very good job for many different situations but it benefits students because of how flexible the hours are. "
good,A typical day for me involves an early shift of setting up the drive through and making coffees for customers. I've learnt how to make different styles and types of coffees and work in a quick tased environment.
good,Was a great and exciting place to work. they had good beneifts and a competitive work environment. starbucks  gives you incentives on amount of certain items sold.
good,A wonderful place to work. Both work atmosphere and employees always outstanding. Opportunities to substitute for open shifts at other stores for extra hours. Benefits for part time employees.
good,"Great atmosphere, everyone got along great, alot of crew activities for people to bond. Pay is minimum wage so it's a great high school job. They offer free college tuition for ASU it's a great opportunity."
good,"A typical day at work involves organizing partners, and managing the general flow of business. Making sure sales goals are met as well and meeting hygiene regulations is of utmost priority. Management can make or break the deal - have had great managers and uncomfortable managers, but overall a worthwhile experience and worth it for the benefits. The hardest part is reorganizing the floor after a particularly brutal day, but going home and knowing that work stays at work is very satisfying."
good,"Great company to work with amazing benefits for its employees. The hardest part about job the is just learning how to become a sequenced barista, to move at a fast pace during peak hours."
good,I got the understanding of working in urgency. I learn alot about beverage repeatable and keeping areas well cleaned up. Meet alot of lovely customers and some bad. But over all it was a good experience
good,"Starbucks is an amazing organization with great opportunity and benefits. Its amazing to work at a company that makes you feel like part of a 2nd family. Its a fun, friendly and fast paced environment to work. If you enjoy being productive, motivated and friendly then a career at starbucks is the way to go."
good,"Great Team "
good,I enjoyed the time I worked at Starbucks and it taught me a lot of different skills that I can use in another job also the environment was good and the people were great to work with
good,If you can work at starbucks i guarantee you will thrive in any work environment. I am grateful for the experience and skills I acquired working there but am thankful to be working elsewhere.
good,I feel that I’m being held beck from advancing and others that have worked there less time are getting paid more and I was told by DM I needed to wait. I love my job and all my partners but politics are getting involved and it’s not my style. I work hard do my job above and beyond and don’t get treated fairly or am acknowledged for it.
good,Shifts were engaging and transitioned easily. The hardest part was gaining the flow of drinks and customers but once you learned it was fun and the customers were like family.
good,"I worked at Starbucks from the age of 16-19 great job, I'm grateful for having been apart of a growing goal oriented business it felt like a family everyday going there if I didn't need to make more money I would have never left."
good,I loved working with Starbucks. I like the atmosphere and looked forward to going to work. Easy days and met alot of great people! I learned about coffee and how to make the percect cup.
good,"Favorite job I’ve ever had, work life was fun& exciting with lots of funny people to work with, benefits are amazing but they use that to pay you less"
good,I work in a very busy and small store so it’s pretty intense and I sometimes feel like I’m underpaid and under appreciated but other than that I love the environment and the people I work with and I love all the benefits we get
good,Everyone was nice and helpful and Loved how energetic and up beat they were. they showed me skills that I have never learned. and they were there when I needed them.
good,They work with you on everything. Don’t be afraid to ask for help because it will be given. Customers may be tough sometimes but it’s like that wherever you go.
good,"Starbucks and its customers have high standards, so partners are constantly being coached with a growth mindset for each team. The hardest part of the job is the quick pace if you end up having difficulty keeping up and mean customers. However, the team supports any partners that are struggling and as for mean customers, loyal customers will go out of their way to make up for it if they see this. The same goes for other partners, we all look out for one another."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks. It was a great place to develop and learn skills. They were willing to work with my college class schedule which was a big plus for me.
good,I was blessed with a great group of baristas and an amazing manager. My work place is always bustling and is having things happen. The days are always a little different.
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. They have a lot of awesome benefits. It can become a bit overwhelming especially in the mornings, but I believe it depends on the location."
good,"Really fun to work here. Always busy, always something to do, you will never be bored. There’s a lot to learn and they expect you to learn quickly, but once you get it down it’s like muscle memory."
good,Working at Starbucks gave me lots of experiences helping customers and exposing myself to a working environment. Great experience of working together.
good,This is a very good first job if you want to be a barista or start in coffee business. Starbucks is a very easy job to maintain . Very diverse staff at many stores . Willing to work around schedules . Have a great benefits package.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Starbucks thanks to my amazing coworkers. A typical day could become very stressful very quickly, especially during peak times like finals week or over the summer during frappy hour (I worked at an on campus licensed store). However, I much prefer a fast-paced environment opposed to a slower one, so there was never a lull and always a way to stay busy. Workplace culture is great, but that's because I think Sbux does a good job of hiring friendly, energetic people."
good,"It's a good place to work, its not too busy but not too slow either. The customers are great and understaning and really easy to talk to. The people that work in the facility are nice and any issues that may arrise they will be there to assisst in any way possible."
good,"There is no air conditioning.  That was only downfall.  But enjoyed it otherwise.  No advancement there."
good,Fast paced job but wonderful place to be! Coworkers are lovely and management is good! Occasionally can get a little challenging with guests but otherwise a great environment
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work in. You learn so much as you go and have such a huge opportunity to grow. The benefits are great, the customers are lovely, and the people you work with become family. You get a chance to make your customers day better with a cup of coffee and smile."

good,A typical day at Starbucks covers a whole lot of ground. Everything from brewing the coffee and keeping the store clean to cash and inventory management.  The culture at Starbucks was one of my favorite things about the job; everyone feels welcome when stepping into the store.
good,El día común es tener siempre ganas de trabajar y dar una buena experiencia
good,"Absolutely loved my five years at Starbucks. My coworkers were incredible from all walks of life and such a great team environment. I was able to complete school work easily and attend all my classes while having a full load each term. All four years of college, I held the role of opening barista, waking up at three each morning. It was a perfect routine, allowing me to fall in love with my morning regulars while still continuing a social life at night. HIGHLY suggest this place as a flexible college job."
good,Overall the experience with starbucks was a positive one. Management was involved and everyone worked as a team to make things run smoothly. There was plenty of support for staff when it came to work-life balance.
good,I loved this job so much but putting a balance between work and a new baby was quite difficult but my manager was very understanding. They were willing to relocate me so I was able to keep working with the company
good,Loved working for Starbucks. Great training process and friendly atmosphere. Had opportunity to advance in position. Busy store and good hours. Loved trying different samples of coffee and learning to barista.
good,"There is a lot more to working at starbucks then just remembering all of the drink recipes! You are constantly moving, cleaning, and prepping ingredients for drinks. Its a great job for high school students and even college students. it pays pretty decent for what you are doing. It can be stressful at time with demanding and stubborn guest. You have to be able to work as a team also, they will become your second family."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. The management from the corporate side is always amazing. Have been lucky and have an amazing crew. Lucky to have worked here
good,"Starbucks has a wide variety of benefits and it certainly takes care of its partners. Morning shifts are the most stressful (especially) if you work at a drive thru store), but other than that, the stress level is reasonable for the type of work you are doing."
good,no comment concern the everyday experiences in Starbuck on day to day basis. just that I learned a lot from them. took the experience I got to bring to another job.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, flexible hours. The customers are very friendly. Management is very hand on with employees. It is a great learning experience."
good,"At Starbucks we were all a family, even with our customers. On rough days we would all work together to make sure we got through the rush hour (which seems like the whole day)  without being too stressed. Being able to build a relationship with your customers is always great, learning their order by heart would be amazing because you can see the look on their face when you have their drinks finished before saying a word to each other."
good,"Great shifts, no late nights. Managers work with other schedules. I was able to work full time and god to classes. Very fast paced work environment, but time goes by quickly."
good,La empresa se preocupa mucho por difundir la cultura organizacional desde el primer día y crear una conexión genuina con los clientes.
good,Starbucks always wants to make their businesses as a third place for customers. So that made barista get to know each customer that walked into that door and make them feel welcomed. Having to show great customer connections.

good,I always enjoy working at Starbucks. The hardest part is keeping up with all the drinks! But keeping up with the speed of customer traffic makes the day go by really fast. I loved learning about coffee and seeing how they create all the tasty drinks we all know and love. There was ample opportunity to advance in your career.
good,Really enjoyed the work and customers.  The benefits are great. Especially ASU and the stock options.  It is good to be a partner.  The discount is also a nice perk.
good,I enjoyed working at starbucks for two years! All my coworkers created such a great work atmosphere for me every shift. The managing was great! I loved all the relationships I made with my coworkers and customers.
good,"Working at Starbucks is not the most difficult thing. The most important thing to keep in mind is that people can be, and will be, rude. You need to maintain your composure and just crank the drinks out. The most enjoyable thing about the job, to me, is that there is hardly a lot of time to stand around, so the shifts fly by. I don't think my manager is the most qualified, and there are (and from my knowledge, have been for a while) issues with shift supervisors who let their feelings get in the way of their position. I have personally had multiple occasions in my short time there that my manager and supervisor have teamed up against me, which is never a pleasant experience, especially straight out the gate. Either way, I'm sure every store is different so I wouldn't let that scare you off."
good,"If you are looking for a part time job to make some extra cash, Starbucks is definitely the place to go! They have amazing benefits and the environment is amazing!! Everyone is always happy and smiling and they just seem to enjoy their jobs!"
good,My experience with Starbucks has been a great work experience for me. It has provided me with the extra great customer service skills  needed to succeed with person to person contact.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is get ready to clock in take orders and clock out, but what I've learned is how to work with others as a team and learn how to manage my hours with school. Management there are very grateful, helpful, and understanding people and the work place culture is amazing. Everything was pretty good.The  most enjoyable job is going home once you know u had a good day at work."
good,"I loved it, if i could get hired again it would be great. I don’t know why i ever left ! The people were great & just the customers you really get to connect with them on a regular basis especially when they come in everyday!"
good,Starbucks was a great company to work for. They really take care of there employees by creating a environment where you can work while having fun and growing.
good,"I loved working for Starbucks! The culture is amazing, the people are very nice to you and very fair. They tried to accommodate all my requests, and they gave me time to learn new tasks as they come new to me. Very patient and understanding team. We have very comfortable deadlines, and our hours were flexible."
good,Great environment to work in to stay busy. The day goes by fast. Regular customers are friendly and love seeing you. 😊 Honestly just do your job and go home. Leave the drama behind.
good,Although not every location is the same. The atmosphere is the same! The energy is always at 100 whether it's go mode or on the slow side. Teamwork is the building block of Starbucks without it we would NOT get though go mode. Starbucks truly is the third place. A comfort area and a great atmosphere.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks during my time as a college student since it provided the flexibility needed for my rigorous academic schedule. My partners were very supportive and friendly - good company culture and training. I gained exceptional customer service skills.

The job is extremely rewarding and you get to be really creative with your work that you do. It was a really fun atmosphere, overall! The customer connections made the  day so much brighter- I loved my everyday customers! This company provided so many incredible opportunities for me, as well. I'd highly recommend working here!"
good,"Great company if u can handle it, great work opportunity and great benefits. It’s fast paced and have a lot of variety of drinks u had to learn how to make."
good,"I would recommend working here to people who are a bit on the younger side since a majority of my coworkers are between the ages of 17 to about their late 20's. It is a high stress and fast paced environment so quick learning is a skill needed to survive and thrive with this job. However, the benefits Starbucks offers its employees makes it worth the stress that occurs during the work day."
good,This company is full of positive attitudes and group efforts. There is never a time when a co-worker is not willing to lend a helping hand. Customer encounters lift both the customer and the partner’s spirits. Lovely workplace.
good,buen ambiente laboral y buen trato del equipo en general.
good,My typical day at work consisted of fast paced moving and communication. It was a fun experience to be hands on after being trained for 2 weeks.  The hardest part of the job was learning all the drinks and how to make them.
good,"Varies location to location. Some were amazing, others were tragic. Hard to memorize drinks, but you got used to it. Takes time to settle in to the job."
good,Really cool place to work. It’s fast paced and it requires practice to really get the rhythm so you can flow when it gets busy. Some stores the veterans who have been there for years can be rude. But if you can get past that it’s alot of fun!

good,Worked there for 10 years. Amazing company. Incredible people. People care very much for your personal growth. There is a ton of opportunity for people first getting into management and leadership.  Benefits are fantastic.
good,"Starbucks provided responsibility, instilled fast paced skills, problem solving techniques and teamwork. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing relationships with frequent customers and creating a sense of community. The most difficult part of the job was correcting situations with unsatisfied customers."
good,"Starbucks at Sodexo on campus is fast paced! If you like the time to go by fast, this is a job for you! If you like to interact with people, this is also a job for you!"
good,"I am hoping to get hired at Starbucks in Las Vegas.  It was one of my favorite jobs.  I enjoyed working with the customers and my co-workers.   Once I realized that all Drinks started out with coffee and typically some type of milk or milk substitute. I loved when the new Drinks were introduced.   I was not a fan of the Protien Drinks at all.   I was surprised that they went over so well.   I had several customers ask what the plant Protien was and it was difficult not being able to tell them I didn't know. "
good,Eğitime önem veren ve insan ilişkilerini geliştiren.Son derece eğlenceli bir çalışma ortamı :)
good,"Fun, energetic, great benefits, involves you with the community. Wonderful company to work with. They make you feel like you are making a difference, the harder you work the more benefits you receive."
good,"Starbucks as a company was incredible and rewarding, many people truly lived and breathed the corporate mission, which is a great one. Unfortunately there is a high turnover rate and while many managers were incredible there were just as many cutting corners looking to cheat numbers and make themselves look better on paper which really hurt the customers. Overall it was a great place to work between well bonded staff, many chances for recognition, very flexible hours including the ability to pick up shifts at other locations, excellent benefits, and the company desire to promote from within."
good,"Everyday is a new beginning for a great day. "
good,"I actually enjoyed working in there, friendly and young people. "
good,as long as you have adult managers and not too many lazy ppl working w you then this job is the best. the job takes focus and that's about it. as long as you take it serious you'll be good.
good,Starbucks is one of the most exciting places to work if you want a fast paced environment where customers and employees are valued to the highest.  I love coffee so I loved working there!
good,I have learned a lot about responsibility and teamwork as well has efficiency and sense of urgency to provide outstanding customer service through my experience at Starbucks.
good,A typical day of work would be me coming in and either be put on bar or the register depending on what the person in charge of that shift decided. We also had daily and weekly tasks that we had to make sure to finish. I learned how to be very quick on my feet and react to something at a moments notice because we can go from very calm to  a packed store in an instant. My manager was always very sweet and a joker but was serious when he needed to be. The hardest part of the job would obviously be during a sudden rush. Going from practically no one in the store and then having a full house for 2 hours straight. The most enjoyable part for me would be making connections with customers and making their drinks. I always loved talking to customers about everything and getting to know them on a more personal level. Making their drinks was also just very fun and relaxing and it also allowed me to get a little creative.
good,Worked on my feet for hours but made customers happy. Remembered a lot of information that I still retain. Coworkers were good but some were mean and untrustworthy.
good,"Starbucks was a job where there was always a customer present, something to clean, or something to restock. It taught me how to always be responsible and focused and to be aware of how the store and myself are being perceived by the customers."
good,I've worked at Starbucks for about a year now and I really enjoy the people I work with. And my boss is an excellent manager. She really cares for employees.
good,I worked at Starbucks for almost 2 years before I had a medical condition that forced me to take some time off. It was a great place to learn the craft but i worked with other partners who were jaded and nasty.
good,"It was my first job and it went well. I either worked six or eight hour shifts. Basically you are a janitor that makes coffee. There is a lot of cleaning, stocking, and organizing. Sometimes supervisors can be rude and disrespectful when you are new, but other than that, its a great place to work as a student or someone with no work experience."
good,"Crafted drink orders in accordance with customer specifications. Perpetuated an upbeat, expeditious environment to satisfy customers and foster long-term consumer loyalty. Resolved customer complaints and concerns through empathy and problem solving. Responsible for answering phones to address customer questions."
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks included checking in with your team, reading about the weekly  Starbucks news updates and having your first partner drink of the day."

The most enjoyable part of my job would be the relationship I have with my co workers, this makes my time at work more enjoyable."
good,"Starbucks Barista or any type of management there are very generous and understanding. I currently work at Starbucks now, I'm currently 22 and started working with starbucks when I was 17. its a great first job, and has many great benefits"
good,"I am so grateful for my almost ten years of employment with Starbucks. It is an excellent company to work for. "
good,It is a great place to be with the culture there. You would be able to learn great insides of the coffee brewing method to latte art. It will be an everyday thing to serve the best drink to all the customers.
good,"I had a great time learning more and making different types of my favorite drink.  There's so many different ways to prepare coffee and customers really enjoy their special hand-crafted drink "
good,"Starbucks company will start to feel like family after awhile. The culture in the company is amazing and everyone excepts anyone for who they are.

good,I loved my job while i was there and was sad to leave but I decided to go into a field I saw myself advancing in. My coworkers were very friendly and I also enjoyed getting to know my costumers on a personal level.
good,"It's a very fast paced domain, but it's extremely fun and very costumer oriented! I have absolutely no complaints, it's a great option if you're looking for your first job!"
good,This was by far one of the most enjoyable jobs I've had to date. I have considered going far with this company and wanting to be in management one day. The best part about the job is all of the wonderful people one sees everyday whether it be the team members or all of the regular and new customers. The hardest part about the job sometimes was keeping up during the peak hours of business.
good,Typical work day would be setting up the espresso bars and getting  everything ready for the day. Also would have to be quick and fast also have a good thinking paste to make all the drinks. Sometimes busy people in the way and a lot of things going on at one time also have to keep focus.
good,Starbucks is a great place to work. It has a great atmosphere with a mix of fast-paced and relaxing. Everyone at work is extremely friendly and makes it feel like a second home.
good,"Over the course of my 4 years of working at Starbucks, I have worked at 4 different stores due to moving to a new state and promotion opportunities. Each store is different and it totally depends on your manager, For the most part, I have had great managers but there have been 1 or 2 that made my job more difficult than it had to be. Placed with the right manager, you are looking at a fun work environment that recognizes hard work and dedication. A good manager will help you discover your passion in the workplace and help you promote if that is what you want. If placed with a difficult manager, you are looking at doing a lot more work than you are getting paid for and/or expected to. The morale in the workplace noticeably declines if you are paired with a poor manager due to the baristas having to pick up the slack. "
good,I love working at starbucks! If you can keep up with a quick paced environment this is the job for you! wonderful atmosphere and decent pay too! Benefits are great!
good,My coworkers and the management at starbucks was one of the best experiences of the job. I always enjoyed going to work and I got a newfound love for coffee and teas.
good,"I really enjoy working at Starbucks. I wish I was paid more, but this is a great job for a college student. The hours are flexible and it's pretty easy to balance with school."
good,great for college students. the managers are willing to be very flexible when it comes to scheduling and hour availability hours. sometimes difficult customers.
good,Wonderful place to work. Helpful company. Flexible hours and all the coffee you could ever want. Only reason I left was because of my feelings toward my coworker.
good,Very fun place to work - enjoyed my time there! I learned a lot about customer service and got to know many of the regular customers.  They let me work early mornings which is my favorite time.
good,"I worked at my university's starbucks. The coworkers were great and so were the bosses, we'd all love coming into work. During rush hour when the customer line was wrapped around, we worked so well together and the customers loved us."
good,The mission of this company drives most facets of this organization and provided a strong basis of pride across the employee base. Structures are known to shift often which can be somewhat frustrating is a part of an ever evolving business landscape. Would recommend over the other juggernauts in the metro.
good,Muy grato el ambiente de trabajo y buenas oportunidades de surgir dentro de la empresa.
good,"The job of a Starbucks barista is a lot of fun, the people you work with are amazing, and the company as a whole is wonderful and well managed. It will teach you how to handle people in all walks of life, customer service skills, time management, attention to detail, and patience with unkind or impatient individuals. It is a fantastic first job to have while you are a student who still lives with their parents and/or still do not have a lot of financial responsibilities, or if you simply need a job on the side. Keep in mind though unless you advance into management or go into corporate(which is not a bad idea), there is no way for you to live on your own off of being a simple barrista."
good,"A job that will accept you no matter who you are, with forever colorful coworkers whom you will always love and find something to connect with. Everyone working there will always be nice to you (or try to be) and try to set you off on the right foot."
good,I enjoyed all the benefits and co workers I got to meet and made drinks on my shifts most of the time. you get to see alot of familiar customers and get to match their drink with their personality.
good,"Starbucks a place that full of education in coffee that we cant have it from outside."
good,"i work for 7 months as barista, i have a good manager"
good,"To date Starbucks is one of the best employers I've had. from the culture, to the atmosphere and work environment, I loved everything about the company. Like any place of employment, there was room for improvement, however these were minor things."
good,Fun place to work can move up and open your own store quickly. I didn’t work for corporate but license stores! Supervisors basically run the store so creative freedom
good,"I started when I was 18 and worked through college and it was a great job for a student. The offer flexible hours and the pay is good once you’ve put in your time. It absolutely matters which location you work at because while every store follows the same standards, the environment can vary wildly behind the counters of different locations."
good,Great work environment and great place to meet new and different types of people. Work days can be stressful at times but making customer connection and making the moment right and knowing that you did your best and a customer was completely satisfied makes it great.
good,Very happy and never a dull moment. Everyone is friendly including customers and baristas. Everyone supports you with every step of the way. Great benefits too.
good,"Es una excelente empresa la cual me ayudó en mi desarrollo laboral, lo único que no me gusto fue por la parte de no tener tiempo de calidad con mi familia por que me absorbía mucho tiempo."
good,"From the moment you wake up to that first partner or customer interaction, the numorus possibilities of how I could brighten  someones day filled my mind. By the end of the day after all the planning, connecting, coaching, and recognizing I always went home knowing that when all of our systems were being completed to the expected standards we helped build our community a little stronger that day."
good,"Is good company to work for. I am happy to be part of company Learn lot new thins in UAE with this company"
good,"learned a lot about myself, management of people and time ."
good,Especially if you are in your early years in the work force this job will give you the tools needed to grow as a team leader as well as self development skills.
good,"This is a great place of learning about coffee (taste, history, methods) with a best place to connect with the community. Good place to enhance skills."
good,"Starbucks was one of the best places I've worked. The salary for an internal promotion was my biggest complaint. Great culture, wonderful team, leadership was amazing."
good,Starbucks was a place where I met so many people who are still in my life today. It gave me the opportunity to be able to move and still maintain a job which is very nice if you are someone young who is leaving for school and still want the extra money.
good,"A typical day at starbucks was usually busy, with brewing coffee, to stocking, to making coffee, to being a cashier and to being responsible for closing the store. There's a lot to learn, in just one place."
good,"I really enjoyed my tenure at Starbucks. Since as a barista I have learned, to be reliable, to be punctual, to work as team, to be respectful to each other, and to be compassionate. I never had to compromise my values and that the company is in the people business serving coffee."
good,"Starbucks is an awesome place to work. They have flexible hours , they pay for your degree and they even help you grow within the store. Starbucks also has great health benefits"
good,Most employees are there for benefits and school tuition positive work environment with great benefits. Entry level fast paced multitasking job In the food industry
good,It can be a fun job and most managers are willing to work with your schedule. It’s a good job while you’re in school or for a second job. It can be a little stressful with all the rules and how corporate wants you to complete specific goals while being customer based
good,This is a fun place to work when you get to know your crew but it is very fast paced and can be stressful. If you don’t like fast paced and always doing something then this is not it for you.
good,Overall Starbucks was a great company to work for during my tenure there. But leadership at my level had many micro management directives that removed creativity and realistic expectations away from the focused goals.
good,"Starbucks has a lot of great benefits. Flexible hours, healthcare options, stock options, paid schooling. It's a very fast paced environment with lots of training provided and a lot of room for creativity. ALL  of that said, a bad store manager can make it horrible. Transfers between stores are pretty easy, however, and most of the stores have fantastic people."
good,"When you get to your shift, I would try to prepare the area where I'm going to be so I'll be all settled. On a slow day, we will focus on maintaining the store clean, and stocked while taking care of the customers. On a busy day, you really put into practice your multitasking skills. We try to do everything as fast as we can, so that we can keep a certain amount of time needed for the drive-thru. That way customers are happy. It can get tiring because you have to be standing for long period of time, moving all over the place. A perk of working there is of course the benefits that Starbucks offers (stocks, insurance), as well is that you get to know the usual customers, and you're able to create great bonds with them. It somehow makes your job better  when they know you know them and their drink, so they are left with a smile on their face."
good,"Starbucks Inc. is a great company to work for with exceptional benefits. If you are one who enjoys and thrives in a quick-paced, creative learning environment, then this might be the job for you."
good,"It truly depends on what location you are working at & the manager. I'm happy I ended up at a good location! The manager that I am working under is very good for being a first time manager. The only downside is that advancing up through the company can be a challenge, sometimes impossible."
good,"Starbucks is a very generous company to work for. They work very hard to provide a good working environment for the employees while giving their very best to the customers. Focusing hard on living their mission statement through and through. It is a demanding retail industry. Fast paced environment with a lot of movement. However, if the desire to grow with the company exists then they will provide the path it just may take some time. In store work environment really depends on the individual store manager."
good,"The Telluride Starbucks was a really enjoyable place to work while I was there, but of course the environment can shift quickly with management, so it depends on who is still there."
good,Each position on the floor has specific duties for service and maintenance. It is easy to establish a bond with coworkers and regular customers. Finding coverage is simple and management is always eager and willing to communicate.
good,"Enjoyed the people, both team and guests. Vibrant, upbeat and ever changing days that keep you motivated and excited to go to work everyday. I was provided consistent training to help grow and develop my staff as well as my own skills"
good,Starbucks has it's challenges its always difficult balancing speed and drink quality but i believe I do that.  The Starbucks' customer is also quite a different type of person.
good,Many opportunities to move up in business as well as to move forward by going to school. Great place to learn about the coffee culture and the art of coffee.
good,"Management can be tricky, but the people are great.  If you lead with integrity you will be fine.  Documents mean everything.  It can be stressful, and high paced."
good,Fun place to manage and build relationships. A place to create friendships that last a life time. Learn leadership and problem solving skills to drive and inspire a team.
good,"Starbucks is a fun, yet challenging, environment to work for and I loved it! There are lots of benefits and the culture is very welcoming! It can be hard at first to learn everything, but is well worth it."
good,"Working for STARBUCKS can be easy going but fast paced during busy times. The staff is like family and the workplace is fun. Don’t forget, LOTS of discounts."
good,"Working for Starbucks was definitely enjoyable. I learned a lot and made great friendships. I personally enjoyed making those great connections with customers, especially the regulars."
good,"If you like coffee, a free pound of whole bean coffee every week (or box of tea or k-cups or whatever) and unlimited free drinks for your entire shift, probably sounds like an awesome perk, but that's not all you'll get as a Starbucks partner. You also get a free Spotify premium account, and as a partner, you're entitled to up to 40 hours a week. If you maintain an average of 35 hours a week, you qualify for insurance and retirement options. It's a great company to work for."
good,A typical day at work is connecting with the customer and taking their orders but not only that you are warming up there food. the shift or the manager assigned you where you will be during your shift. sometimes it could be stressful in the morning and other times we could be fine. you have to work as a team and also the environment is fun when they have music playing while you work. in afternoon shift is relaxing at times but you have a lot of task to do before you leave your shift. the hardest part at first working at Starbucks is just memorizing the information and it feels overwhelming but you will get through that part to learn every part of the position and it makes you stronger as a person. the most enjoyable part is that when things go downhill you have your co workers by your side and top of that you get really good benefits and health insurance
good,"It is a fast-paced casual coffee shop, with very good benefits, and all the free coffee during shift and free coffee beans for the week. It also provides schooling,. Managers are hit or miss but thats true for most places."
good,"Honestly Starbucks taught me EVERYTHING about customer service. When you are working in the Food and Beverage department no matter if its fast food or a steak house, your the FACE of that company. I think Starbucks, by far above any other company I've seen, has created the perfect foundation for excellent and almost flawless customer service, and great work ethic/cleanliness."
good,"Muy buena empresa, preocupada por sus empleados y los recompensan de buena manera"
good,"I worked mostly days, but during nights too. I enjoyed the relationships I shared with my coworkers as well as the customers. The hours are flexible and there are ample opportunities to grow your leadership skills."
good,"The company's mission was its driving force. Different regions and areas follow the missions and policies on a more case by case basis than others. The culture was always a family a feel at every store I worked at. As a Supervisor it was my job to make employees feel encouraged, confident, and empowered in their every day. The most enjoyable part about my job was always the employees."
good,"At Starbucks you feel at home and everyone is kind and understand. It is a quick pace work environment and there is a lot you need to remember and memorize. I love learning knew things about all the different coffees and what pastry they paired with. My managers were always understand and quick to help when help was needed. It was a second home for me and a place that I loved to be. I wasn’t just going to work because I had to, I was going to work because I wanted to."
good,When I started I somewhat thought the push for the company was unwarranted. Quickly I found that there are regulars who really look forward to not just the coffee but the relationships with the workers.
good,Starbucks was a wonderful learning experience out of high school into the work force love the company and the culture they really care about their partners
good,"Uma empresa excelente para se trabalhar, com diversos prós. Fortalece um ambiente agradável, e ensinamentos de como crescer profissionalmente."
good,Starbucks was a very good place to work I enjoyed it a lot and every day was different. Only reason I left was to do a different career. Management were great with you.
good,"I was apart of a great team and I do miss it. I was a shift lead and we had a lot of fun while working, but our quality of work was always at its highest."
good,Working at Starbucks was really a treat.  The management was amazing and friendly and I really enjoyed all my coworkers.  The work itself was tough but I really enjoyed the fast paced environment of it all.  The pay was standard but it would have been nice to be paid a bit more (around $15 an hour) because it was difficult to live off of minimum wage.
good,Fast paced. Stressful. Need to be concentrated. No call ins or being late. Maintaining clean and clear work environment getting along with others such as coworkers and customers
good,"Starbucks a a chilled laid-back work space, in which you are given the chance to learn skills that will be helpful to you in the workplace and in life. Personally I learned a lot about costumer service and how to handle difficult situations, which I believe is a very important thing to have learned during my time there. In my experience it was very easy to communicate with management (about any problem that may arise, or any schedule changes or issues at work or in your personal life that may be affecting your work) and this was really important to me due to a lot of life changes that I experienced during my time there."
good,"- Interesting to learn how to make drinks"
good,The only complaint i have is that the new manager that came in to replace my old one had no respect towards the store. It fell apart and we had a lot of unhappy workers.
good,Working for Starbucks was an amazing experience. Hard work was recognized and I was promoted to management with in three months! I would work for them again in a heart beat.
good,"I'll always tell people that I enjoy working at Starbucks. The stores that I have worked at have always been staffed by people I get along with and enjoy, secondary families whom I really come to love. We laugh, we know each other, we become friends. The company itself is a good one to work for; they give us benefits above and beyond what most places will get for this type of work, including a 401k and some stock."
good,I always opened for the store and it was a nice calm enviorment . I learned that coffee brings people together and is very universal . Management was very cool and was glad he gave me the opportunity to be a leader.The hardest part of the job was making sure each customer was satisfied while going fast pace. I loved that we could wear piercings andcolored hair and just be artsy  .
good,Always a fast paced environment with strong leaders in key roles. Customer service was always a priority and the training was impeccable. The hardest part of the job was keeping to their extremely high standards but this also created one of the best teams I have ever worked with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team recognition for doing beyond an excellent job with pins to add to hats and monthly employee awards.
good,"This company is hands down one of the best companies to be a part of. The mamagement is incredible, the company in itself, and everything it stands for and represents is amazing. Starbucks has always done a good job with demonstrating diversity, and making EVERYONE feel comfortable, both customers and employees. I’ve learned valuable lessons while working there, I learned how inportant it is to be a team player, and it has broadened my customer service skills. I love this company with all of my heart."
good,"My experience working at Starbucks was great, I enjoyed working with my employees, management is okay and it is a good place to work if you are looking for part-time work."
good,Perfect job for the caffeine addict like me. Tough to learn and master but worth it. How many hours you get depends on where you work; its all up to the manager tbh. Pay is good for what it is as well.
good,"Starbucks, the coffee company from San Francisco that could, which we of course all know as a corporate service powerhouse in the coffee industry."
good,Easy to get hours changed around and easy to pick up hours from other partners when you need more money that week. Loved the flexibility and loved getting fed (free meal a day and free drinks on breaks) while I was a student.
good,"Very Nice, Good Management, Fun to work with Staff, Stressful at times, Short Lunch, Not many hours per shift, easy to get started, good training program."
good,"Interacting with customers was great. The team I worked with was easy to get along with. I learned a lot about patience while working here, since customer service entails a lot of patience."
good,"I love making drinks, and during the rush hours time flies so fast. The majority of your coworkers are probably gonna be fairly friendly, never had an issue with other coworkers or management. If you are up to the challenge this place will fulfill"
good,"Overall, a great job, great people most of the time. If you work really hard and mesh as a team, it pays off. Every store I ever worked at became a family."
good,"One of the best atmospheres I have had at any place I've worked. Everyone that works in the SA from the president, to people who clean up the commons are so nice."
good,Enjoyed working in a fast past environment with great people. Learned a lot. Enjoyed working on the highway-great mix of people coming in. Shifts went by fast.
good,"This job was my first and I love it. It's very fast paced and competitive!  The workers are lovely and the job is pleasant.  You get discounts on wares and free drinks!  Plus you get free gratis every week. They do provide benefits and they can help you in so many ways like getting a car,  going back to school,  you can invest in Starbucks stocks!  It's not a hard job but,  can be stressful because of the customers.  The management was the only downfall of my particular store."
good,"I loved working at Starbuck, it was my second home. During my time there my co-workers felt like my second family. I genuinely looked forward to going to work. I learned time-management and customer-service skills."
good,My time with Starbucks was full of life. Never a dull moment. You meet many different kinds of people and find the right way to make their day right with a selection of quick-to-make beverages. Working with a corporation such as Starbucks really reinforces the idea that you make a difference in people every day.
good,"Great company overall. Great enviornment for the workers and for the customers. "
good,"Quick pace when busy, incredible people to work with typically, early morning hours can make living a normal life hard at times if your not an early riser. Very welcoming company to work for, family atmosphere. Very hard to stand for hours doing quick paced repetitive motions (not a good job for some one with wrist pain). The company is very strict about health codes (no wrist or hand Jewelry at all including wedding rings if they contain stones). Can be stressful when not properly staffed. Incredible benefits for a food  service job. Typically pays more than minimum wage. Very flexible hours, you can even work at other stores within your district for more hours if needed. The company does a great job of making a welcoming place for all walks of life. AWESOME discounts too."
good,I loved my job until new management made everyone miserable and everyone good quit and all she hired was lazy people and I ended up doing the job of 2.
good,"Really love working for Starbucks, they have a special place in my heart. They'll always be home to me. Great people, management can be worked on a bit."
good,"Structured training, room for advancement, employee discounts, flexible schedule, great atmosphere, fun work. this is a great job for someone fresh out of high school or college"
good,Overall enjoyable place to work. Offer relatively quick promotions if you show interest. Multiple opportunities for advancement. They do provide amazing benefits and free coffee is always a plus.
good,"If's you want Starbucks to provide enough to live then you'd have to work close to 40 hours a week. The job is easy, not really stressful as long as you can handle a busy rush."
good,Both of these places gave me great work experience. I felt the management was approachable and kind as well as very efficient in their communication. I would highly recommend both of them.
good,I was given a trainer who spent hours of one on one time with me to ensure I was comfortable in my roles and knew how to execute them efficiently. I made a lot of good friends through Starbucks and in general had a great experience that I almost didn't want to move away.
good,"This job has helped me grow as an employee and as a person, learned skills and everyday life tasks. The work environment was always nice, as well as organized."
good,"Great place to work. Working at Starbucks enhances one's collaboration as people need to learn how to work and plan things as a group. Moreover, the fast-paced environment increases one's ability to work at places where one has to be fast and meet deadline quickly."
good,"Typical day at work would of been fast paced with none stop go go go, cleaning and refilling any syrups and powders that are low."
good,"Starbucks is a great job. You meet so many new people, learn new skills, and get lots of free coffee! It's the best job I've had yet. It can be stressful, but overall, I loved it."
good,"I've worked at more than one location and the people have always been great, and nothing beats the flexible schedule. I really do enjoy working there."
good,"management was great! they were very awesome at training employees and managing the store. i did not run into any issues, they were good at keeping everything in order & professional"
good,"great place to gain experience for fast pace working. hardest part was the location being that we had many homeless coming, just a few weeks ago staff were robbed at gunpoint. so LOCATION was the worst part of  the job."
good,"Relax "
good,"They usually promote within."
good,I feel Starbucks is a nice place to work for a student.  The staff and management were willing to train and educate new employees.  The hours and schedule work well for college students.
good,"its really the perfect job for students and people who are looking for par time, it would get stressful at times but manageable  and you get to know alot of people and some you get to be friends as far as the hardest part of that job was nothing."
good,"Es una empresa que atrae muchos clientes por lo que todo el tiempo estas ocupado en la venta o preparación de bebidas, tienen buenos valores y cultura laboral y también esta muy bien dirigida y administrada. Lo más pesado es la cantidad de gente que hay que atender llega hacer muy cansado pero el tiempo pasa rápido y llega hacer divertido."
good,"Write a review but I didnt get enough hours to fully understand the business , it built me up with customer service and engaged with people, but other than that I was not allowed to be tipped or receive so and hours were cut short because of the manager/."
good,"A typical day we have daily routine for the morning and mid day and night.work place culture is family we take care of each other. i make sure the store is always in order and we get things done on time. we get to meet and connect with so many different  people everyday.we build great friendship , communication and just have for everyone."
good,"I would recommend working as a barista, it is very relaxing place to work at who enjoys the smell of fresh coffee. a typical day at work we get around 200-300 customers each shift. working there we learn to brew coffee, make coffee exp; Lattes and fancy coffees. we had to make sandwiches for simply to go."
good,"typical day is fast past during peak hours, it is fun and time will go by quickly if you do your job. Management is very understanding with hours and flexibility. Workplace culture is fairly changing but in a good manner. hardest part is making sure your give quality service even if you are under the weather and stressed. All in all, it is a family and your co-workers are your partners and its a great work environment."
good,"Great company to work for, benefit package is top notch.  Great advancement opportunities.  If you work at a location where you get along with staff, it can be the best job ever."
good,"Les journées passent très vite au Starbucks. L'ambiance ce crée par les propre employées. Lorsque quelqu'un ne se sens pas bien, ils sont toujours la pour nous remonter le moral. J'ai beaucoup aimer cette expérience."
good,You should raise your salary to make all the passion worth fighting. I understand that it is as low as the minimum but people really need to make a living so make sure to raise your salary for us to stick with our passion.
good,I love working at starbucks the partners are great my manager is amazing and i love that we can get free pounds of coffee every week and free food and drink. starbucks encourages their workers to try all of their products so they are able to accurately describe the drinks to customers. overall it is a great place to work.
good,environment and people are nice. The manager that I have is amazing and awesome to work with. Peak hours are kind of stressful and can get pretty hectic.
good,"Great training system and consistent management/inventory plan. Easy to learn, easy to implement, great environment. Opportunity is there if you are interested/willing."
good,Starbucks has a fun work environment that is focused on achieving tasks as a team. You have the chance to become a certified barista and experiment with fun drinks.
good,"Overall, this was a great job and served me well. The management is organized, I learned a lot from my coworkers both about business as well as about coffee in general. The culture was fun. Hardest part of this job was waking up super early because I worked the opening shift and also just generally dealing with people can take it's toll over time. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to play around making drinks, setting up the merchandise displays but mainly, it was the amazing people I got to work and network with."
good,Definitely team driven and always busy. Never a dull moment and every day is different. Very engaging environment with something to always do. Very neat skills learned.
good,Many good memories working for this company and lots of lifelong friends. Only downside is barisitas are quick to be overworked and pressured to hit times faster and faster. Loved for for this company.
good,"Fast-paced and stressful work environment, but made enjoyable by co-workers and customer connection. Learning how to work quickly and efficiently while still performing good quality work. Dealing with customers can be a positive or negative part of the job, but either way you learn how to satisfy each customers needs to make sure they have the best experience possible."
good,"My typical day at Starbucks was busy. Starbucks was, taking orders, making drinks, and cashing them out all at once. I learned all the drinks and their ingredients. I learned how to a fast and efficient worker, all at once. management was great and the culture was even better! The hardest part of the job was how to line you're ducks up in a roll to knock out all upcoming drinking in a professional manner. I enjoyed everything about this company but I favorite part of the job was inventing knew drink ideas that the customers loved."
good,Management sucks and there is alot of favoritism going on as far as advancement goes but if you are just looking for something fairly temporary or just to earn extra money Starbucks is a good place to work.
good,"Because I worked under Target FOR Starbucks, my experiences were probably a bit different.  As a Barista, I was paid more than an average corporate barista, but Target was very disorganized and hard to work for at times. I loved making coffee and serving customers."
good,"I love working at Starbucks! Yes we do have some bad customers here and there, but overall it's a fun and creative environment if you're into that. If coffee and tea is in your daily life, consider applying!"
good,"a typical day would consist of me managing my time and team to perform excellent while maintaining the store and customer service , the culture was always there and thoroughly put in the training course"
good,Customers are stressful to work around but the employees are nice and managers are usually great. I enjoyed that full time benefits were offered to me at 20 hours per week.
good,"Starbucks was a great place to work, it was quick paced and I was able to build rapport with the customers and gain customer service skills that will help me in future jobs."
good,"-Extremely fast paced on weekends, slow weekdays"
good,Starbucks has a lot of great benefits which include insurance and college tuition assistance. They have funded my entire college degree and I am so happy to have found them when I did.
good,Es una empresa que se preocupa el 80% por su personal pero existe una falta de equilibrio debido al exceso de trabajo que a veces no permite tener una calidad de vida fuera de él. Sería. Bueno también modificar esos horarios tan extremos o regular a ciertos supervisores/gerentes que no realizan bien su trabajo.
good,"I need full time work and hours"
good,fast paced location had a needed management change learned a lot of personal skills from working in hectic environment. was promoted to supervisor and did was could to make situation better.
good,"learning all the different drinks, the hardest part of the job would be working through rushes and maintaining calm. the most enjoyable part of the job would have to be all of the coworkers around creating a fantastic work environment."
good,"Stay barista. As soon as you cross the line into management your life is not your own anymore.  You work way more than 40 hours without compensation or tips or bonuses if the company changes the parameters and if you have a crummy DM, you are sunk for advancement."
good,Everything about Starbucks was great except I couldn’t handle how horribly the customers treated me. The company itself is great. The manager at my location was very nice and professional.
good,Really enjoyed being a Barista but pay increase was minimal and advancement isn't likely with pay increase.  Benefits and hours offered were reasonable.
good,"I learned a lot about the job culture, including the lingo and the names of each beverage and how to make the classic ones also. The people were really nice and fun to work with."
good,I really enjoy working at Starbucks great people and great opportunity improve my skills as an employee and as well help me grow as an individual. Overall a great environment for workers and customers.
good,"Amazing atmosphere, so much passion in every worker. Regulars are more like friends than customers. So many opportunities in the company to make friends and find a passion for coffee."
good,Starbucks made me what i am now as a Barista. They developed my skills and knowledge about coffee and customer service. This company really helped me with my self esteem and my interaction with guest and colleagues.
good,"I worked as Starbucks as a Part-Time Barista, they are very flexible with my work schedule and they always make sure that I prioritize my studies. My colleagues were fun and easy to work with. They have great benefits especially for full timers."
good,"A good place to work, although at times it can get stressful. Management is for the most part good, although some are better than others. The company is good at taking care of their workers and there are pretty good benefits."
good,"Working at the Bucks was the best job I ever had. Not only was it super fun (making drinks, dealing with regulars), but i loved my coworkers. During rush hours, it is hard work but never unmanageable. They also provide amazing benefits such as free tuition through Arizona state, and even health insurance. The starting pay wasn't too bad either considering it's food business. Ultimately, I had to leave because of schedule conflicts but I wish I never left!"
good,"En el tiempo en que fui parte de la empresa, me sentí bastante cómodo, gente muy amable y el ambiente siempre ideal."
good,"If you like to work and need a job, chances are the starbucks near you is hiring. Do them a favor and go apply. It's filled with crazy customers, awesome coworkers and a lot of work that needs to be done."
good,"This was my first job as a young adult and I have no regrets working here. Most, if not all, customers and coworkers have been nothing but great to me with only few out-lying people that made my work life a bit more stressful. Coworkers feel more like friends than they do coworkers."
good,"Days went by fast, Very early mornings, Employees are surrounded by Starbucks Culture from the very beginning, Starbucks business practices are amazing."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, however depending on your manager, depends on the level of stress you will be under. I worked there for 8 years and there were great managers and ones that wanted everything from you without a thank you at all."
good,"A typical day is made up of greeting guest. Doing coffee tasting. Taking food and drink orders while learning different guests names and bits of information about their day that they divulge while I make them a delicious drink. The hardest part can be the stamina involved that is needed and or remembering certain details given after the fact. Though people make a perfect system does not mean it works perfectly, to say the least. My most enjoyable part of my job was seeing someone take a sip of a drink and smile, priceless."
good,Starbucks is a great company that offers you the ability to really get to know your customer base. It is an open and loving environment where everyone is welcome.
good,My role has taught me a lot while working in a fast paced environment. Balancing employee and customer care along with store management is a challenge but having the support of one's manager and fellow team members helps a lot!
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is, it is busy during the peak hours. We make our most money in the morning. We started slowing down going towards noon, to pick right back up by 2 pm."
good,"Everyone experience may be different depending on the crew members, store manager and what store your at. You choose the day you want to have by the way your feeling."
good,It was a great place to work ! manager was great! they worked with my hour I was in school. I was trained to be a Barista it was very fun. It was a friendly place to work.
good,"Each day was a pleasure and meeting new people everyday is such a joy. Certain hours during the day, call for a rush of people ordering. To enjoy the job, you have to enjoy making drinks."
good,I have very much enjoyed working for the company of Starbucks. I do find it ridiculous that managers have to switch every so many years. My manager recently had to relocate and she was the best I ever had. I do love the relationship I have with my customers and appreciate the benefits that come along with the job.
good,This is a stressful job but can be very fun to go to work when your coworkers are lit and know how to do their job.. life isnt serous nither should the job just respect everyone’s wishes and get through the shift
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for. At times it can be very hard and fast paced, but it does pay off. I have loved working there. I have been with the company for almost 7 months and it has just been a great experience."
good,Great environment to work in. fast paced but relaxed. management are very understanding and work with you around your schedule. I would highly recommend this job to any and every one.
good,a great job for students or stay at home moms needing extra money. manager was always willing to work with school schedule or other work schedule that you might have.
good,"Awesome atmosphere, I believe this position enabled me to be present at work, be more focused with my tasks as everyone kept each other accountable to their work. The environment was dynamic and pleasant, however we kept customer delight at the front of our agenda."
good,Starbucks was a great place to work. The environment was great and I really enjoyed the people. It was easy to catch on to making beverages and I enjoyed getting to know the regulars that came in.
good,Starbucks was a great job while I was in college and the benefits were good for the time put in. The hours were pretty regular and my manager was very flexible with class schedules and time off when exam time came around. The people I worked with were generally great and I've seen that across the company not just in the stores I worked in. Overall a fun place to work while getting through college but I don't think I would ever look at the retail stores or any of that management structure as a career.
good,"I began working at Starbucks with my best friend and ended up making 3 more very close friends there. The routine can get old sometimes but the management did a good job at moving us around the floor so that we were not doing anything for too long. The hardest part for me was learning to be quick on bar but by the end I had it down, everyone there is really good about bringing each other up."
good,"Perfect for students, flexible work hours and locations across the city. great first job for anyone wanting to work with a team and enjoy serving clients."
good,"This is a great place to work while going to school. The company truly cares about its partners, and does a lot to help set them up for success. The only downfall is with anything retail is the work/life balance. It's hard to have a social life when your constantly working weekends."
good,"My experience with Starbucks had been great because the demand of being able to multitask, listen carefully, and be promoting beverages or food to the customers has helped me be a better employee. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to connect with customers as they are either about to start their day or end their day with coffee. Starbucks beings people together which allowed me to familiarize myself with customers by making them feel special if i remember their name or drink."
good,"es una muy buena empresa, cuenta con un muy buen equipo, especialmente sucursal centro maya, el gerente de esa tienda tiene un muy buen criterio de liderazgo. los compañeros son todos muy honestos y puedes crear relaciones con muchas personas. "
good,"Flexible schedule and great discounts (30% off coffee, free 1lb coffee weekly, free spotify). Great people and great values, they look out for you. I really enjoyed my time at Starbucks."
good,"Working as a barista at Starbucks is a great place to start, especially for students or young parents. Generally schedules are flexible and most managers seem to really care about you and your situation/life."
good,I great job for college students. Very flexible with your hours and able to transfer if need be. Easily can request off or get a shift covered if you need to go out of town or for any occasion. Great experience for improving social skills.
good,Hardest part is gona be getting everything done in a short period of time the pay was good and hours was good the environment is laid back and cultural
good,"Would typically help inform customers on drinks and other products sold within the store to help them arrive at their own decisions, and would sometimes help them out deciding what to get. Learned excellent customer service, communications, organizational, and conflict resolution skills. Hardest part of the job was during rush times because they got really busy during rushes. Most enjoyable part of working there was essentially everything else because of the friendly staff and atmosphere provided in the workplace."
good,"Crazy busy location (clayton heights) with both a lobby area and drive thru. It’s a great company to work for, and the people you work with truly make it even better. Flexible hours and opportunities to advance in the company. How fast you move up depends on how hard you work - and I love that!"
good,I truly loved when i worked at Starbucks you got familiar with your guests that came in and remembered their drinks made them super happy you can make great relationship
good,"Super great place to work! Fast paced environment keeps for a fun and quick shift. Customers are funny and kind, a great opportunity to make new friends."
good,"Starbucks is a very welcoming company who focuses on ensuring all customers feel welcome. They're dedicated to the Third Place Enviroment that the community can look to for a variety or reasons. They offer consistant training and opportunity to promote. It had it's rough days, and sometimes it was hard, but working alongside people of all dfferent colors, creeds, backgrounds, and personalities made each day something new and exciting."
good,"It was my first job, I loved it.  Depending on the area, busier stores have better tips.  My store was 24 hours so after we closed we were able to take home all the extra food left over from the day."
good,"enjoy the work, hard to connect with customers during severely heavy work peak times.  very busy but enjoy the culture.  enjoy learning about coffees."
good,"starbucks has a great work culture, you will become life long friends with your fellow partners as well as with customers. its a great place to become an active part of your neighborhood."
good,Rewarding work environment operating as a business owner with corporate leadership directing many promotions and sales goals. The job encompasses many Human Relations duties and is customer facing majority of the time. Varied job responsibilities
good,I loved working at starbucks however some of their management team is hard to get along with. For the most part there is alot to learn and the environment is always positive.
good,"Great Experience"
good,"I love my job here at Starbucks. For the most part my customers are great and I have formed relationships with many of them. I enjoy working with my cowokers although at my location, the management could be better at hiring people who would excell in a fast paced environment that requires multitasking. Love the coffee perks!"
good,"They treat you not just a employee or staff, they treat them as a family or friend, making a Good decision with the partner's and also with the customer. good personalities."
good,"I say that starbucks is an interesting workplace because of the people you get to meet and the work you get to experience. I can definitely say that starbucks is a place for growth, it's not a job that has the same requirements as a law firm lets say, but it does have requirements that give you an opportunity to grow and try more."
good,"Jobs are very seasonal and fluctuate with company initiatives. Management overall is very welcoming, genuine and constructive to all Partners across all my experiences at Starbucks. The hardest part of working at Starbucks is that there is not enough support for Partners that come from the retail settings."
good,"Starbucks is a very fast pace and stressful environment to work in, especially as a beginner. It takes about two weeks for a new person to get adjusted to the environment of the company. Customer service and quality production of our products is key to the whole job. It is enforced so that we may see great results at the end of the week. I would say the job itself is the hardest part about. The people of the job are what make it worth working there. Starbucks is very particular with who they hire as well as who they put in management. That is why the managers of the stores are rock stars. Starbucks also has really good benefits that they provide to each employee. This is what attracted me in the beginning."
good,Fun place to work with many opportunities to progress yourself within the company. Good work hours with excellent management. Incentives held monthly.
good,I loved my coworkers and the environment  was relaxing and stress free. I wish I could've stayed because it was my favorite job. Free drinks was definitely a bonus.
good,"Great place to work while going to school.  They pay good and treat employees fair.  Great benefits.  The hours are early in the morning, and late at night depending on your shift but otherwise a great place to work."
good,Loves my conworkers and the guests . The new manager was too much for me though . I work open some days and close others . Loved the benefits and how each Starbucks worked together as one
good,"A usual day at your nearest Starbucks, you are surrounded by good people and great customers. It is a very personable job. Some days are harder than other because of either busier than usual or shortage in staff, but we all get through it as a family. We all work well together as a team. The manager is very involved, he is there every weekday morning interacting with customers and helping where he can to make the shift run smoothly. Needless to say, I love my job."
good,"Great staff, good perks and friendly environment"
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work for anyone who needs to work around a school schedule. Great atmosphere! I enjoyed thoroughly making people's beverages.I had worked for Starbucks previously as a assistant manager, I returned because it is a fun place to work. The training provided to me was adequate and came easy after a while. The management takes interest and makes sure the environment is comfortable at all times."
good,"In the year and a half I worked at Starbucks, I enjoyed thoroughly making people's beverages. There were few times I actually was frustrated with the job itself, even during our rushes in the morning and afternoons. I would love to work at Starbucks again in fact, because I liked the hours and the activity of the job, plus the customer interactions were mostly pleasant."
good,Starbucks is a very organized and fast paced workplace which requires skills with great customer service and multi tasking. It's a lot of fun and super easy to become a great barista.
good,You meet so many different types of people. You get to learn many different things about the products in the store. They don't just sell coffee they tell you about the culture and where it comes from and what it should be paired with. It was a great experience.
good,"Starbucks was a great first-job and really opened my eyes on retail workers. Management was great, along with the hours. Highly recommended to students"

good,Enjoyed working with others and developed strong foodservice skills. It was a nice environment and the customers were friendly and it was an enjoyable place.
good,"I would definitely recommend working here. It is a perfect short term job, however long term seems monotonous. Great discount on food, drink, and retail."
good,"Buena empresa,pero falta ver más por su trabajadores,no se descansa por los horarios"
good,"Work is extremely stressful and not for the anxious or light hearted. customers are great but can be mean. certain managers love and devote their life to the company and others work from home because they can even though they are on the schedule to work on the floor. must be willing to put up with partners calling out last minute, morning rushes, missing products, crazy promos, and complaining about terrible hours. you work for sbux because you care about the company and its values, you leave the company because of poor managers and poor leaders. but at the end of the day your prideful of a job well done."
good,"It is a great place to work. Very fun and fast paced. Team work is a must in a job like this. Be ready for long days on your feet. Customers are usually nice, can sometimes be demanding."

good,It is a great job to have while going through school because they are great about working around school schedules. It is a great environment to work in.
good,"This is a great job to have. It really is dependent on who your coworkers are and your managers. I've seen people leave one Starbucks for another so each store is unique. Overall the work is not hard, its a fun experience with some nice benefits for a part-time employee."
good,I only left because I was looking for more flexible hours. Starbucks is an amazing company who really cares about their employees. The benefits are great and you can receive health insurance if you work a certain number of hours. Free Lunch every day you work and free drinks and coffee you can take home once a week.

Learned various information about coffee, where and how its grown. Coffee tastings and its pastry counterparts. Management was always pretty easy going. Hardest part of the job are those super busy days. Most enjoyable part was brightening up someones day with a simple cup of coffe and some small talk."
good,I enjoyed the training program and the opportunities to learn about all the different recipes and coffee varieties. The fast- paced environment made the time fly by and I loved that the expectations never changed from day to day.
good,"Good job for Xtra income and if you love coffee it's the right place to work. Great for students or retirees."
good,"a typical day at work was pretty relaxing till it got busy haha, i learned so many valuable things about management through them.the hardest part of the job i would say was remembering all the code for writing on the cups. Most enjoyable part about it was all the customers and my employees"

good,I love working with Starbucks. I love my team and my manager. I have been blessed by the benefits that Starbucks provides including help with getting my education. I would love to stay with Starbucks but unfortunately I don't get paid enough and don't see much of a way to move up any more than I already have.

good,"a typical day at starbucks was very busy the entire shift. i learned how to make drinks, within a month making drinks was a task i could do with my eyes closed. Management was alright. Hardest part of the job was no help during rush hour and no one willing to help. Most enjoyable part of working at starbucks was definitely meeting new people and quickly becoming a part o their everyday life."

good,"Starbucks was an enjoyable workplace, though it could be stressful at times. I enjoyed the competitive atmosphere and the motivation to meet goals. I would certainly recommend working for the company."
good,"A typical work day consists  of running from place to place taking care of customers. Customer care is very important to the company I was always told that the customer comes first and in the store that I worked at it was always the number one concern. I learned how to multitask and how to be more personable. The management was the best that I have ever had, she was always very understanding about needing time off and when it came on to school. I loved that i was able to collaborate with other partners and whenever we had down time we would work on things that would make us a better barista. I learned a lot about myself from working at Starbucks. It challenged me a lot personally."

good,"it is an excellent place to work."
good,"A typical day at work is usually very busy, multitasking is a daily function. Outstanding customer service is our number one focus. I have learned to deal with many personalities, utilize my customer service skills, and to be a role model for my team. "

good,"A fun, fast-paced environment. The benefits were nice and you were taken care of by the company. Working with customers was lots of fun and even the lowest ranking employee could be sure that their voice would be heard if there were any problems."
good,over all the fast pace work place was ideal for me i loved the culture and learned a lot about the company and the coffee that is being sold the hardest part of the job was working along with other supervisor who didn't know what they were doing so it was frustrating since they couldn't handle the fast pace or didn't know what to do in certain situations.
good,Though I've had my fair share of issues with certain management staff Those unfortunate shortcomings did not turn me off to working for the Starbucks company as a whole. I loved the work environment as well as my co-workers with whom I still keep in close contact with until this day.
good,Starbucks has been a great company to work for. They provide many benefits for their full-time and part-employees. Being with the company for over 10 years now I have learned about the retail world and the coffee industry.
good,"Great place to get your start or advance in the company. Tips are split fairly and the discounts you are given for drinks, food, and whole bean coffee was amazing."
good,"Without a doubt, the culture and the inspirational leadership at the highest level of this company are far and away the best ever.  And I say that after 15 years with the company.  As a salaried manager with a commitment to excellence, the 365 day a year, 20 hour a day on-call status and the almost always 50 - 60 hours a week was difficult to sustain and expect to have work/life balance.  I wouldn't trade it for anything, though."
good,"I love the company, I am just trying to find a better job for a career with better work and life balance. The job has provided work much needed experience in so many fields of life."
good,Starbucks was a great first job for me.  I learned how to manage money and handle situations that revolve around people skills.  The benefits are better than most part time jobs and they treat employees well.

good,Keeps you meeting very interesting people. the benefits within the company is great. The best part is you get to sample all the new stuff first. You get to meet a wide variety of different culturistice people.
good,"With an upbeat crew of baristas and managers, serving coffee for the brand while delving excellent customer service is the great. I would definatly people to work for the company."
good,"Starbucks is an exceptional company to work for. It was always the right amount of work, and fun. The customers became like family. There was always opportunity to learn and grow."
good,"It was a very quick paced job. I loved working quickly and in a team environment. I learned how to work with time management, make several beverages and how to maneuver through the cash register."
good,"Fast-paced work environment, especially in the mornings. Learned how to make typical coffee/non-caffienated beverages. Co-workers were great, and became friends. Enjoyable atmosphere for those who like to interact with people"
good,"Any customer service job can be stressful at times, but on a slow day working at Starbucks allows a lot of opportunity for stress relief with the people that work there.The flexible scheduling helps ease some tension as well since we don't typically work long hours."

good,"The sole reason I left Starbucks, is because of the poor management. As a student I had specific times which I could work, that he never gave to me. Had the management been better, I would have stayed."
good,Recommend for young professionals starting out to be able make you a more well rounded manager. I would enjoy the family like atmosphere in all of meetings.
good,"The  most  enjoyable  part  about  my  job  was  the "
good,"The Starbucks  shoot was my first time assisting on a book. The collaboration between client, photographer and stylist showed so much creativity. Shooting on location gave a different edge to the work put in to the culinary styling,  rather than shooting and styling in a studio."
good,It is a good place to work for a couple of years. I would not want to work here for the rest of my life. The employees are nice but the customers are hard to deal with.
good,"This job is honestly one of my top favorite jobs that I've had. Everyday was different, and it was really fun to work for a company that provides an amazing work environment. In addition, the benefits of working for Starbucks taught me leadership, management, and creativity. The hardest part of the job was working with that certain type of customer that had the most complicated drink they loved. Although, one would say that could also be the most enjoyable part of the job, knowing you made somebody's day by giving them an excellent cup of coffee. Overall, I would definitely recommend working for this great company."
good,i love starbucks personally and everything they have to offer their “partners” as far as college benefits health and so much more. Anytime i here of someone needing a job always at the top of my mind for a suggestion is starbucks.
good,Fast paced work environment that allowed you to work as a team with your peers. The job allowed you to get to know and work with the community while simply serving beverages
good,It was a fun environment. Learning all the drink combinations and meet tons of awesome people everyday was enjoyable. Its an fast pace environment and its long hours on your feet but the tip were great.
good,"Starbucks is one of those companies that people try to have a problem with but can't. They really care about their partners and have their best interest at heart. Starbucks will work with you as long as you work with it; you are given many amenities that other companies would not dare to give. The customer connections that you make are second to none and the relationships you build with other employees makes the job fun. The issue can be with in store management, or the lack there of. Emotions can run high at times with the partners and at the end of the day it is a job. As long as you remember that it is a job you'll be fine."
good,"A typical day at starbucks is busy, never bored there is always something to do. i learned how to a make drinks and learn cash register. hardest part of the job is dealing with customers moods other than that its pretty fun."
good,"Working at Starbucks  is fun and teaches you to interact more with the customers in serving the right drink for them in taste, in temperature and whatever they would like to order to make sure it is the right drink for them. You interact with your co workers as well and work as a team from opening the shop to closing with another day to look forward to at work. Working hard with those around me was fun and learned to cooperate with all kinds of customers that wants the right beverage or pastry for them. I love it at Starbucks and have fun while working as well. They are flexible with your hours if your going to school throughout the day and able to work at night instead or other major reasons. Starbucks really cares for their customers and their employees as well. I would definitely recommend this job to a friend."
good,"-learned how to manage orders and customers and processes."
good,"- lugar agradável "
good,I worked on and off for this company for 12 years.  It was amazing company that was very supportive of their employees.  There is a lot of potential for growth with the company.
good,Starbucks was a very fast paced environment and helped strengthen me in customer service with all the customer interaction I've experienced while working there. I learned personal growth as well the importance of building relationships with those around me from coworkers to our everyday regulars. Management was okay but definitely could of worked on organization and time management. The work environment was repetitive for the most part but once you have your own rhythm down it becomes a daily routine! I was surrounded with hardworking coworkers who had relatable goals to mine which made my work life run smooth and created good working habits. I loved the team work we had in our store to accomplish everyday expectations along with the customer satisfaction that kept us going. I would recommend this line of work to anyone who is motivated and doesn't mind putting in the extra time necessary to become a successful barista!
good,"A typical day at Starbucks is fast paced. You need to be up early and be ready to take on the day no matter what it may throw at you. As I got to know my customers over time, it got to the point where I knew which order to have ready as soon as they walked through the doors."
good,"It was such fun work place at Starbucks. "
good,"I love working for Starbucks because I work with a team that cares, sets up the next shift for success and works at 110 "
good,"Company continues to operate true to its core values and mission statement when it comes to having coffee at the heart of what it does. No two days are the same, but each day has the potential to be filled with great customer interactions and shared experiences with a team of baristas and supervisors. I feel Starbucks does look after its employees, however, it can be a hectic and high adrenaline working day that can deliver challenges as much as it can offer rewards. Its certainly a company I have enjoyed working for over a time period that stretches back to 2005."
good,"Fun place with a strong sense of being together, also managers are good for the most part. If there were any issues there was someone I could always turn too. Great Barista trainers and Shift Supervisors."
good,Although at times working at Starbucks can be stressful the environment created always made if a fun place to work. Management was supportive and there were many growth opportunities. The company also provided many perks and benefits.
good,"Loved working here for the people, discounts, and free drinks. Pay was fair and received tips every Tuesday. Shifts were fairly available and hours were fair too. Only downside was some of the crabby customers."

good,"Busy on and off, lots of tedious work and continuing job tasks, you do switch every couple hours. The management is okay and the culture is a lot like high school where people deal with issues like kids. the most enjoyable part of my job would be the customers!"
good,Depending on which type of store you work at things could be extremely fast paced or super relaxed. I had the pleasure of being able to work in many different types of retail stores and get the full spectrum of experiences.
good,"I enjoyed working at Starbucks but and appreciated the benefits and chances to move further up in the company. If you have a passion for retail, I would say Starbucks is the place for you."
good,"My days at Starbucks we're really good. I miss my peers. But it was a stepping stone. it was time for me to move on. I wasn't getting enough hours, and the pay wasn't that good."
good,The company is a great place to work while going to school. They provide flexible hours to accommodate most living situations and provide wonderful benefits
good,"Starbucks does a great job training you to prepare for the many coffee and drink formulas that will be thrown your way. Hours may be unpredictable at times. Benefits are fantastic, great employee discount, health and dental insurance as well as free meals and drinks. The environment is fun, easy-going at times, but can be stressful and fast paced during specials and mornings."
good,"Starbucks is a wonderful company to work for. There were a few issues with shift leaders that were a concern. There was some ""bullying"" from upper management but when it was made known to the supervisor the situation was handled."
good,"muy buena experiencia , cafe gratis, turnos rotativos"
good,"I believe that the work place was very acomodating to the staff members at Starbucks. Those who requested overtime or extra hours would be able to get that scheduling. "
good,"This was a wonderful place to work while I was in college. I was at the Starbucks, and it was an extremely fast paced environment that was always looking for ways to improve the process. It was a lot of fun for the time being."
good,This was my first job so I didn't like it at first but eventually I came around. I really started to love this job because it has everything that you need
good,"A typical day at work revolved around a rush while being short on staff. Supervisors were kind, but manager not so much. I truly enjoyed the environment of the calm music. Not much to look forward to besides the discounts, free coffee, and other benefits."
good,"liked working at starbucks....."
good,"With proper management, this job is a breeze. With awful management, it is still a breeze but annoying. Starbucks values and morals of the company represent the progressive nature of the world and represent a positive change toward the world as well which is appreciated."
good,Always a great company to work for. I was down and out and they gave me a chance to really gain more skill and grow as a person in ways I never expected. Wonderful supportive environment.
good,"I have been with the company over a decade. They give back all the time. Great benefits, great discounts, free coffee while you work, meet great people, and always an opportunity for growth. Highly recommend this company."
good,The education and healthcare alone make this company worth working for. The added discounts and assistance programs make you feel like the company cares for you despite the tiny monthly paycheck. I respect Starbucks for that and hope they continue to do what's right for their employees. I would 10/10 work here again if I needed to
good,"I managed the store's weekly inventory. Best part of my job! Also, i love the regulars we had. Always came in with a smile and sometimes a holiday card!"
good,"Great work experience good benefits , very fast pace which is good for me it helps the hours go by faster. Nice customers a lot friendly faces , nice neighborhood"
good,"i loved working at Starbucks, it was always fast paced a little stressful in the beginning but once you get the hang of it its fun and the people are great"
good,Great job with a great workplace culture. It is a great place to work even if you start without coffee knowledge. And the chances for advances are high and there are lots of things that you'll be interested in while working thIere.
good,The partners and also The costumers made the experience of being a barista cool and fun. The startbucks i worked for was the flag ship store so we were the biggest in the country so it was more intense then other smaller stores
good,"This market of stores in Ireland is not run by Starbucks Corporate so do not go in expecting the same benefits. This group is great, they do offer many perks and they do work hard to try and create a supportive environment with bonuses and well-structured operations. The hardest part of the job is long hours that can sometimes be required as a store manager, but the most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with so sometimes it all works out. This is a great job for developing as a leader and business manager, I continue to learn every day."
good,Worth working for because you get a lot of in store training and is very enjoyable. I learnt alot about customer service and how to make customers happy every time.
good,"I am a very fast learner to do any kind of job, with a little explain of something i can do things by myself. Also bilingual and love working with computers and numbers"
good,"A great place to work, during times of peak hours or season management can be harsh on employees to preform at high levels. Great place to meet all different kinds of people."
good,"This market of stores in Ireland is not run by Starbucks Corporate so do not go in expecting the same benefits.

good,"I love working at Starbucks. Since it's always so busy, time always flies by. People that tend to work at Starbuck are very unique which makes work very interesting."
good,"starbucks is an awesome place to work. Its fast paced and fun. Making drinks can be really fun too. By far my favorite job ever. Although,  I wish they would pay a little more."
good,First work place i work more interact and make connect with customer and need more chit chat with our customer culture starbucks is to more customer and want to make starbucks is third house which is work place is second and first place is home..a lot i learn about how to be indipendent and all assistant manager job/task i also can make only setences thing like ordering and schedule ..a lot i can learn think out of box
good,it was awesome working for the company but management had favoritism & some co-worker didnt do their part so you had to do it which is ok for a while beacuse we were a team but it gets tiring.
good,"Prepare store for opening, set up cash registers, make coffee, tea, mocha, set up pastry case, greet customers upon arrival, take their order, process their order, connect at completion of hand off.  Maintain store cleanliness and stock pastry case and RTD&E case throughout shift..  This store had several management throughout my time there.  A new learning curve came with each manager.  The hardest part of the job was to find replacement baristas when someone called out.  Most time, the shift was left short handed."
good,Honestly the best part time job I've ever had. I quit because of my store's manager but literally every other aspect was fun and fulfilling. It could be busy at times but that only challenged you to see how fast your barista skills were developing.
good,"As a supervisor I really joined Starbucks!! They gave the chance to be coffee master. My team was very good,always smiling and we helped each other. The hardest part of the job was the pick time and targets"
good,Opening at 5am. Always making drinks and always remaking drinks. 8 to 9 hour days. Sometimes working 2 to 9 people. I love the people I work with. and I enjoyed the fact that I transferred to a better environment.
good,The  customers are usually really nice to talk to.  My team members were usually very easy to connect with.  The environment was very nice to work in.
good,Love the people I work with which make the quick paced times more helpful. The customer connection is really important to have. Fun places to be around and work at.
good,"I worked at Starbucks for a little over 3 years. Training was quick, but fun and exciting. I met new people every day and also got to connect with familiar faces on a regular basis. Benefits cant be beat. Felt like a second family."
good,"Working at a Starbucks at an airport is a constant line, which I never mind. It made the day go by faster. Customer interaction is the best part of my day, if you love coffee, constant line of guest, then Starbucks is the place for you!"
good,"Typical day at work was busy, energetic and fun with our regulars. Loved my regulars at my old New York store 130 Fulton Street, New York N.Y 10038. My shift supervisor and manager were amazing and are still friends to this day."
good,High growth global brand. Advancement will require longer hours and more travel. Benefits package were the best of my career. Would still highly recommend this company to work for.
good,"Going into work each day always help something knew. One day it could be super busy and you can't keep up and the next day you're ready to fall asleep because it is so slow. The amount of customers could be easy to handle however a co-worker is not there yet, or didn't show up. Each day is something new but the best part by far, regular customers. They're always so happy to see you and can be very patient if you're behind on your work load. They care how your life is going and can always make you feel loved. They were my favorite part about my store in Waycross."
good,"Great place as a first place of work. Teaches invaluable lessons useful in future. Environment in the store really depends on the manager, but the company generally finds good people to run the shop."
good,"A day will consist of many different kinds of people with different personalities, characteristics, and attittude, coming from different cultures as well. From there, what I have learned is how to communicate well, tolerate, and adapting to the environment each person brings to our store. Being patient is also what I have learned in this job, that you can never argue with the customers. The workplace culture is very fun as you get to work with a lot of people and be part of the team where you can create a culture under the one roof of the starbucks store you work at. the hardest part of the job is not with the customers, it is with the people you work with. Sometimes, the management hires the wrong people for the job which makes it challenging to be on the job. But, the best part is you get to be friends with those people in and outside the job, and the same goes for your customers. Once you connect with them, they not only know you from within the store but also outside."
good,"Too many wonderful things to say and too many cracks in follow up. Follow up is the hardest and weakest part. The regulations on work hours and logged budget are so tight that training, deep cleaning, work availability, and allowance for emergencies in the schedule often slip or actually go undone. The initiative of Starbucks for care and support of partners and customers, along with drink and cleanliness quality is nearly unrivaled when maintained by proper management."
good,Working for Starbucks provides opportunities for advancement into management. Provides free coffee beans weekly. Provides stock options and healthcare options.
good,"A typical day of work would be preparing product for the day in preparation for the rush. Starbucks has taught me to take initiative to lead the baristas on the floor while also maintaining a good relationship with them as well. The most challenging part of this job would have to be learning how to make drinks with all of the recipes and standards; this was a challenge because I strive to keep true to what the company wants as a standard so it was only a challenge to learn how to steam milk and such on bar. Once I learned this though, working on bar and making drinks became easy and I kept to company standard. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to engage with regulars as well as seeing new customers come in; being able to make someones day makes this job worthwhile to know your efforts of being kind is making a difference in the lives of others."
good,"I like working at Starbucks, but they so not pay well or give me enough hours. However, my manager is one of the best I've had and all of my co-workers are great!"
good,"If you enjoy meeting new people, this is the job for you. I learned a lot about providing great customer service here because of the companies motto. Overall I would recommend this job to others."
good,"I love working for Starbucks, Being able to help make peoples days better by just a cup of coffee makes me feel really good. Plus you get to meet amazing people from all over."
good,"Fast paced, crazy at times but super fun! the company is great if you work in the right location..closest thing to being a bartender in a packed nightclub."
good,"Starbucks baristas perform several job duties and provide customer service. Baristas at Starbucks take orders and make coffee, tea, and other drinks to customer specifications."
good,"It took me three months to feel independent on the bar and six months for me to become a Good Barista. The menu is extensive and often customized, but it basically comes down to following directions. Teamwork and communication is key for a good shift. Management is often good and reliable. It seems like there are two kinds of shift managers; the anxious, passive aggressive Monica or the 'looks good to me' Joey. I suppose you can choose how much time you want to spend being angry in the workplace at Starbucks - or maybe that's just the free espresso talking."
good,"Typical coffee shop duties, fun and fast-paced work environment especially during the holidays. Learned how to make all Starbucks drinks including special edition & holiday drinks.  Management at the time was sub-par.  The gals I worked with were fantastic and would recommend working for Starbucks to meet long term colleagues.  The hardest part of the job was the opening shift at 4:30am and the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my customers on a daily basis."
good,"Quick paced, exciting, and fun environment. I love getting to know my regular customers while crafting new beverages! All of my partners felt like family as Starbucks encourages lifting one another up and encouraging each other regularly."
good,I had a Great experience working at Starbucks. Very flexible and reasonable to work with when trying to organize with my family and work life. I had no bad experience working there.
good,"Starbucks teaches you a lot about yourself and about others. It can be a fun environment, but there's always something that can be done! Some stores, although have a destructive vibe."
good,"The job is great and for myself it was in a good environment with the best people.  As you work your way up though, the pay doesn't tend to reflect the amount of responsibilities that you are enduring to run the company."
good,"our store was amazing.  great crew, fabulous regulars.  The last manager managed to run off every long term employee by either firing them or chasing them off."
good,Everyday when I come to work I must be well rested because during peak in the mornings is our busiest time. I learned how to interact with unpleasant customers and work fast paced. I was able to move up to be a supervisor and was always welcome to move higher if desired.
good,Great place to work. Job security and comfortable place to work. Always busy and hours were good. It is always busy so you hours goes by fast. Training is short but thorough and updates are frequent.
good,"General Barista duties: take and fill orders; prepare food and beverages; attend to customer satisfaction, general cleanliness and upkeep. Train new team members in accordance with official standards. Contribute to team effort and positive morale in the workplace"
good,Starbucks is a model company and it filters down all the way to the base level as a barista. I would recommend it as a job for anyone and there is room to grow.
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. It was defiantly a life changing experience. The customers, for the most part, were awesome and we built strong relationships."
good,"The everyday tasks that shall be completed in the store, and showing exceptional world class customer service. The company is a great company to work for it has a great work environment and also as a whole you will get paid for your work and the benefits match. Its all worth it."
good,I was only here for a week as it was work experience but I thouroughly enjoyed the workplace at it Is warm and welcoming and found it easy to learn and picked it up quickly
good,A typical day at work is to come in and just start working and for the most part enjoy the people that I work with and our regular customers. Working at Starbucks for almost 2 years and the only thing that has been the hard part is to get used to new staff members. The culture of the store I am at is laid back but sometimes stressful depending on our level of business for the day.
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for. The atmosphere was wonderful. There was a lot to learn about front office management, inventory control and customer service. The days started early. But, we were focused on customer satisfaction and product quality."
good,Great company with great benefits awesome partner perks hours can be a little rough and it's so fast paced it can be stressful at times but it's great to work for a company that values their customer experience
good,"Starbucks has a unique culture at every store, whether it is a drive-thru or cafe store. The coworkers are great and easy to get along with, and making drinks is actually a lot of fun. When it gets slower during the evenings, we practice latte art and discuss promotions. I would recommend working at Starbucks to anyone of all ages."
good,"Uma empresa multinacional, com bastante probabilidade de crescimento e aprendizagem sobre café e chá e suas importâncias e qualidades. Uma empresa que trabalha com public, e seu funcionários uniformizados e muito bem treinados para realizar as tarefas do dia a dia."
good,"Starbucks can be an awesome place to work and can fit almost anyone's needs.  Benefits and discounts are really great, customer service is fun but challenging, and your team is made up of great people.  Management can be tricky to work with, as they're highly pressured."
good,"my typical day at work was rather fun and stress reliving. I learned communicating skills and how to handle myself in different situations. my manager,she is a great person and helps out everyone in a work related or personal problem. for me there wasn't anything difficult about the job. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make your own favorite drink."
good,Great place to work at while in school because of the scheduling flexibility. Management is very understanding and helps a lot with issues within the place. Open minded environment allowing everyone to feel welcomed.
good,"It is a nice and comfortable place and I would love to meet different people,I want to work in a developed and modern country like canada , I wish success for both of us"
good,"Working every morning for rush hour Mon-Fri, sometimes oicking up shifts during the weekends for extra hours. Learned to enjoy the job no matter what the workload is because of the people I worked with was fun to be around. Management is great to work with. Most enjoyable part of the job is every customer leaves the store with a smile and returns more than once a day."
good,Working at Starbucks has allowed me to grow both in the workplace and as an individual. through my training and time spent at this place of work I have learned many valuable lessons which will allow me to offer a viewpoint from both a work savvy and personal opinion in any situation in which I am faced with
good,"Well timed shifts, 3 breaks for maximum  rest for each part of the shift. Helped me become more social in my work experience. Fun 2 years of my work life."
good,Working in this company is a very delightful experience. They had me in love with my job all while making me strive to learn more skills and knowledge.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks involved building connections with customers and providing the service Starbucks was known for. I had every opportunity for job advancement, and some of the management actually cared about developing talent. I have become a more hard working and confident individual as a result of my time here."
good,"Despite its challenges, I enjoy working as a Barista, specifically because of the open-minded atmosphere that allows for a quality connection and intellectual conversation with anyone who enters the building."
good,great place to work and it looks good on your resume. Easy enough to pick up but stressful enough to keep you on your toes. customer experience is probably the best cause you never know how the interaction will go or what stories or surprises they'll bring. most days weren't too bad
good,"Learn a lot about my costumer needs "
good,"It's a fun job where you learn to love your fellow baristas and find a whole new family. It's fast paced, but time flies by! You learn so much about coffee and people as a whole. It's so great!"
good,Amazing work place with great co workers. Was ready to move on after working for the company for 12 years. would recommend job to all want a fast paced enviroment.
good,Starbucks has Awesome benefits. The company really cares about there employees. Your not guaranteed a full 40 hours a week is what I didn't like. You also get Stock which is really good
good,Starbucks gives me a good opportunity to connect and meet new and exciting people.  I feel that because my store is located in the mall it actually gets more business than a café would.  I really enjoy working for starbucks and plan to stay here for as long as I can. A very good company to work for
good,"Starbucks provides plenty of great benefits to their partners. Fun, yet demanding. Starbucks makes being a barista easy and fun. It is really a company that want to a partner develop and grow."
good,"I loved working at starbucks, this job is where i grew the most as a person and i dont regret ever working here. i would definitely recommend this job"
good,It's great to be a student and work there but not as a full time only job. You don't get enough pay to be able to do the things you would like to do. Tips can help but it's still not enough.
good,"I loved every minute, we became an amazing family, the job was flexible when outside life got in the way, always a pleasure working for this company and management was great!"
good,"I have positively loved working at starbucks. The benefits, if you can take advantage of them, are unparalleled in this type of job."
good,"Starbucks is a fabulous company to work at - with good reason. The people they hire often have a positive, hard working attitude despite the amount of drama that goes on. Starbucks strives to give their employees a lot of benefits and incentives to be better and move up within the company. Hard work is often rewarded and I never minded going to work there."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of making various hot and cold beverages, often times very specific portions and temperatures. "
good,"A typical day at work varies depending on what your 'role' for your shift is. It can consist of making drinks, stocking product, taking orders, handling food and most importantly interacting with customers."
good,Everyone I worked with was great. Everyone treated each other like family. The management team was astounding. the pay was kind of difficult and overtime was scarce but hours were always available.
good,"great company culture, listen to and follow what employees needs,"
good,"It was a different type of job when I work than it seems like it is now.  If you are a real people great job we were encourage to have conversations with customers."
good,Best job i've had so far with the exception of my current manager playing favorites with her new hires and not giving us opportunities to move up. I would recommend this job for college students who need money.
good,"A typical work day has opening/closing store duties which include stocking inventory, cash management, inventory/daily ordering, checking milk fridges and temperatures, deploying partners during peak volumes, giving partners meals and beaks, and cleaning."
good,"Starbucks had a lot to offer young people, education paid, opportunity to grow within the company, etc."
good,"Working for Target / Starbucks requires lots of multitasking and keeping track of your daily tasks and coworkers. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone is on the same track, working as a strong team and using each other's strengths to press through the day. The freedom of experimentation at Starbucks was definitely the most enjoyable part, seeing customer's happy with new and upcoming products."
good,"This company gives many benefits to their employees, however this job is not career worthy unless one plans on becoming management of some sort. Benefits include stock, free coffee and one food item when on the clock, a 30% discount on items when off the clock,free spotify premium and several other types of programs to help their baristas. The atmosphere is fun but structured and busy (depending on your store). I would absolutely recommend this job."

good,A empresa é agradável de se trabalhar mais como todo local tem os seus prós e contras
good,"Starbucks was a fantastic company to work for. Their benefits kick in at 20hrs a week, which includes tons of discounts and health insurance. You receive a free meal every time you work, and they're great about giving out breaks. You also receive one free ""mark-out"" of your choice of bagged coffee, tea, or even K-Cups."

good,working as a barista was a fun energetic job. i like my coworkers they trained me and always greeted me with  a smile . my supervisor was nice and always was around to answer my questions
good,No matter what time of day you start there is always something to do. You get to meet new people all the time as well as learn who the regulars are. Some of the hardest parts of the job are just keeping the teams on a proper deployment to get drinks out on a timely manor.
good,"Really enjoyable place and there is a daily challenge on work, a very organize company with clear vision and strategy but since the company is too big  you do not have clear vision to your career path"
good,"Great company, awesome and fun environment. Pay is not great but benefits outweigh that. Opportunity for growth and advancement, and training is useful."
good,I have enjoyed this job. I love the community aspect of this job. I have found Starbucks to be a very ethical company. I am leaving due to the fact that I need to find something more in line with my future goals.
good,Starbucks was by far my most favorite job I've ever had. The benefits you get even when you're just part time are incredible. I definitely always suggest Starbucks if even tells me they are looking for a job.

There ways always something to do (cleaning, making coffee, or interacting with a customer) I would love to get into a job that would bring these qualities back into my life."
good,"Work was enjoyable as out duties as baristas were to keep the workplace clean while assisting customers. If they were displeased with a product or needed assistance, I was there to help along with my manager. Our job was to ensure the customer left satisfied and with answered questions. The hardest part of the job was staying on top of the cleaning while working a bust shift, but that did not mean it was impossible."
good,"I believe everyone should work a customer service job at least once in their life. Starbucks is a great place to work! It is one of the easiest jobs to get into in order to receive health benefits and educational payment assistance. The culture is amazing and there is always room for growth. You will never forget your Starbucks family, baristas and customers alike."
good,"Great workplace, to make friends. I love to make coffee, and truly believe that i bettered myself every day while working there. The ability to learn how to interact with customers whether they were satisfied or not helped me a lot, and the organizations from the planograms taught me how to organize my everyday life."
good,Working at the Aladdin was a great experience for me. It was my first job and I loved it. I loved seeing the smile on people's faces when they got thier coffee.
good,"I loved working here, it made me feel good about myself and my own work status because it provided us with security knowing that we were getting paid a lot and paid weekly. But we also got great hours."

good,Starbucks taught me the tasks of multi tasking and fast paced work environment. It was a great team oriented environment. They offered an amazing training one on one. I would say my enjoyable part of the job is the connections you make with your partners as well as customers.
good,Really enjoyed working here. I met so many awesome and just vibrant people who loved me dearly. I learned so much about myself and how to compassionately work with a team. It also taught me how to communicate in such a way everyone would understand you.
good,"In the location I worked, we very rarely had huge rushes, but the atmosphere was still stressful and scary at times. There's a lot of memorization and multitasking is a huge component"
good,Fun job with great flexibility for students and people working multiple jobs. I would probably work there forever if they paid enough. Experiencing a year or so as a barista is amazing. Utilize the benefits too!
good,"Starbucks is and has been the best job of my life! Amazing staff that is kind and caring. We mingled and meshed so well. Great place to feel safe at work and have the time of your life. My manager was and still is to this day the best person I've ever worked for! The job is hard working and something that you don't expect to be as hard as it is, but the experience you get from it is worth it all."
good,"sometimes I have my moments, sometimes can be good days or bad days but it's a great job to work at. You get to work with barista and making sure all milk and pastries are restock and fifo ( first in, first out) we all work as a team and help each other."
good,"For over three years I worked as a barista in several locations (and picking up shifts all over Toronto). I found the work practices to be consistent across the board. Management was supportive and engaged in employee welfare. Benefits are available for part-time employees, which is not something seen in many companies and was very valued."
good,"Working at Starbucks has always been an enjoyable experience. I would gladly continue to work there just for the experience, wonderful benefits, and the supportive partners I got to work with every day."
good,"Working at Starbucks can be very stressful at times. It is a very fast-paced environment with the pressure of being as fast as possible while maintaining a pleasant customer experience. The hardest part of the job for me, is keeping myself from getting flustered under pressure. On another note, my favorite part of the job is forming relationships with customers that we see everyday and having the ability to make their day a little better as well."
good,This job offers a good variety of learned skills. Every day is an opportunity to meet and connect with new people. Time management is an important skill I learned as a shift supervisor. I also learned how to properly deal with uncomfortable situations and work out a solution for any issues. I also place orders for the store and help to train any incoming baristas and assistant managers.
good,Starbucks definitely made me a coffee lover. I learn to create the numerous of recipes there is and learn about the whole coffee background. I also learned to managed my time since they have a time limit set for each client.
good,"fast paced, and very messy. this job  taught me the meaning of multitasking, and teamwork. a typical day involves alot of drink making, but also a great deal of cleaning."
good,"Starbucks has helped shape myself in managing time management skills, as well as the resilience to work under high amounts of pressure. The company offers amazing benefits, as well as the option to pursue a BA/BS at ASU for free! It has been amazing working for the company so far. I've met a lot of amazing people, and been through some tough challenges and situations with people that I consider family."

good,Starbucks is a very detail oriented company who really cares about the people they employ. They are very efficient at what they do and how they train others to do it. I really enjoy it.
good,I would recommend working at starbucks to everyone! its a great work environment and the best job I've ever had! The typical day at work was a little stressful because it was so busy but i loved it.
good,"I would work on the cash register, clean dishes and counters. I would make drinks for customers and interact with them-my favorite part. I would clean up the bathroom and bar. My least favorite part was upset customers, but I loved the challenge of trying to cheer the customer up and leave them happier then when they came in."
good,"The best QSR to work with. The stores are posh, you get the respect you deserve, recognition comes when you do your work well, the work culture is amazing."
good,"A fantastic foot in the door to building relations with ambitious people and learning the ins and outs of a ""community"" driven business!"
good,"After working with this company, I would say they are in it for everyone. They help partners with school, in pushing for further education and bettering yourself. Job security is not an issue in a growing company and they even allow you to pick up shifts at another store as long as you don't hit the 40 hour overtime. After 1 year you get stock option which grows as you are working in the company."
good,I love working for Starbucks. The company has great perks for the employees. It does tend to get busy but the rush is worth it. I would recommend this job to others.
good,This is by far the best company I have ever worked for! This company takes great care of partners (employees) and always goes above and beyond to accommodate customer needs!

Making new friends and connection to the customers. there's no hardest part in the job when you love what you do. and that's what I've learn in starbucks. Every day in work is enjoyable and my favorite part of my job is making coffee and giving satisfaction to every customers."
good,"Nice place to work I managed 12 Starbucks coffee through out Paris helping to trouble shoot the equipment for the stores, dispatch technicians as needed as well as writing reports and translating company documents from English to French"
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. The enviroment is amazing and it is fast pace. Learning all the new drinks and all the new promotions is awesome
good,"Starbucks has a little place in my heart."
good,"Every day is usually busy but its fun because we have a lot of regulars.  The staff is friendly and tasks at work are straight forward.  Being fast and efficient is important though, especially during rushes."
good,"I worked in a Target Starbucks. Everyone actually associated with Starbucks was amazing and great to work with. The Target part of the management was awful. They continually understaffed us to give our allotted hours to other parts of the Target team and refused to give us help when we were in dire need. And because it was a Target store, job advancement had to follow their guidelines, so the best person for the job always got overlooked for someone from the outside to come in and take over."
good,"This job was helpful in teaching me how to work as part of a team and build my communication skills, as well as my customer service skills. It came along with good benefits."
good,"Starbucks, as you can imagine is a very busy place to work. There is always something to do, usually ten things to do at once. However the pay and benefits are the best compared to other coffee companies."
good,"Working at Starbucks was honestly an amazing experience. They not only have the best tasting coffee in the world but they make their customers and employees feel like family. They make each experience feel like a new one. All of my co-workers were easy to get along with and whenever I needed help, they were there. The hardest part of the job for me was making drinks at first. There are so, so many different recipes and so many new ones we had to learn. but my most enjoyable experience was overcoming those hardships and now making the drinks are a piece of cake.  Unfortunately , I had to return back to school and was not able to continue my employment there but I wouldn't change it for the world."
good,"A typical work day is fast, and fun. Everyday there is something new you may learn about a persons preference.Management was great. Co-workers were easy going when they had the pace. The hardest part of the job is not being a coffee drinker."
good,Starbucks is an excellent company to work for. The rating on work-life balance is a little lower only because you're likely either working very early or late into the evening and your schedule will vary each week making it difficult to make plans. I loved working for Starbucks and hope to come back someday in a corporate position. This job is perfect for individuals who love to meet new people and enjoy a fast paced environment. I have also seen many shy people come out of their shells at work due to the amount of talking we do with customers.
good,"Love the personal relationships with customers you gain, as well as a great sense of what it takes to satisfy everyone, with patients and a touch of empathy!"
good,"Providing customers with tasty beverages all day long"
good,"Working for Starbucks was a great experience! Very hard work, keeps you on your feet and the culture was great. I worked from 3:15 til midnight for about a year and a half while my daughter was very young. I could not do that job forever but it was wonderful while it lasted."
good,Multi tasking was required in order to achieve daily goals that were achieved through team efforts and constant encouragement of our supervisors. there was also product knowledge required to enhance the customer experience and most importantly - ensuring that the customer achieved a valuable experience each time they were served.
good,"I love working here but it was a quick easy job to find when I needed one. They are busy constantly so it helps time go by fairly quickly. Aloud me to become better at multitasking. Every crew member are very unique and outgoing, so I was able to fit right in. The hardest part about the job is my manger, they just started and are still getting adjusted into the store."
good,Starbucks cares about their employees from the Managers to the baristas. Anyone can advance with hard work and determination. The benefits are extensive and the work environment parallels the customer environment. Everyone is treated with respect and understanding.
good,"Starbucks is the elite retailer in the coffee industry.  No coffee retailer can boast of delivering the delicious, strong, full flavors that Starbucks brings to the table."
good,Fun place to work. I had to ride a bike to work and the employees and management were very understanding. I was given as many hours as possible. They were very responsive to my need to work.
good,"a typical day at work was going and punching in getting my apron on and restocking products, cups, etc. I would be immediately be put in from of the customer assisting them or helping other co-workers with keeping the flow of work going.I learned how to communicate with people better and deliver service with a smile in a timely manner. I learned how to take initiative in the work force and have fun doing so. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers and delivering my service that they felt the care and attention to detail of the product they were receiving. the hardest part of the job was having to leave in the middle of a coffee rush it was one of my favorite parts of being in a fast paced environment.Loved my co workers it was always a matter of time before I would become a good friend with any of them."
good,When you think of starbucks you think of legendary services. Well with HMS Host we give you exactly that. when it comes to management they can careless about the regular employees. Its about what benefits them. I got into a car wreck and had to go to the hospital which caused me to miss a day of work instead of asking me how i was doing they told me that i had to bring a police report because they didn't believe I had a wreck.
good,Rewarding in every aspect of the job.  Excellent Mission and Values to live by both inside and outside of the job.  Excellent work life balance.
good,"i love to work in starbucks every single day is different and challenge ,i like to training the new barista ,i am the barista champion 2014 in district"
good,I love where I work dearly it is a wonder place to work for at and to come into everyday and just make someone smile with coffee . I love what I do but there is a need for change .
good,I worked for starbucks for twenty years and oversaw the major growth of the company and very much so enjoyed my long term journey with the company.
good,"A typical day at Starbucks would consist of customers enjoying the environment and atmosphere that Starbucks has."
good,Starbucks was a wonderful place to work. The company offers great benefits and connections with customers and partners truly inspires everyone's days.
good,"While working at Starbucks at my school was very enjoyable as I was able to see and work with my friends and classmates, the demand for the products of Starbucks is very high. Instances of said high demand from customers would be during exam dates and weekends. A typical day at work would be either working at the register, taking orders from said customers or at the bar, making said orders for said customers. Through my work experience at Starbucks, I learned that higher demand for said products at Starbucks means that I need to work that much harder to supply satisfaction to said customers. Managing my time with schoolwork and Starbucks was relatively feasible although I had instances where I had to sacrifice studying time to work as my job hours were during the weekends. My co-workers were very friendly, supportive and very well-synchronized with the workload. The hardest part of the job was providing demand to so many said customers at the same time. However, that was also the most enjoyable part of the job as I like to keep myself busy. Another aspect of the job that I enjoyed was working with my friends."
good,"Starbucks Coffee Company has been a tremendously positive impact in my life, it provided me with the opportunity to flourish in management where I had been previously held back in other jobs. They connect their partners with the community and treat each other with respect and kindness. The benefits are great and the pay is very fair. It can be a fast paced and demanding job, but the atmosphere that Starbucks provides helps remind one another to always make the moment right."
good,"It was a nice enviroment"
good,Really great company with great benefits. Co-workers were a blast to work with and got really busy during the summer. Got to meet some amazing people while working there.
good,Cozy environment. Employees always coming up with ways to make the work enviorment fun. Strong bonds with guests. Outstanding coffee. The store always looks its best.
good,"Fast Paced work environment is usually the typical day, you always have to be on your feet and never anticipate the ordinary because literally anything can happen which ultimately makes it fun to go to work. Learning things while on the job come naturally with repetition this included learning regular costumers names. Management is very understanding of my work and school schedule and really take into consideration that I am a student as well as a worker so very flexible hours. My co-workers are the best thing since sliced bread, there is never a dull moment and constant smiling makes the place feel less hostile and going to work is something all of us completely enjoy. Honestly my job is very easy no hard part about it. The most enjoyable part of my job is feeling like I belong, like I am on a Team of people that genuinely care and this is what work environments are all about. Without an enjoyable work environment I would not be happy with a Job."
good,"The benefits package is fantastic, you only need to work 20 hours each week on average to qualify for health benefits and they are really good and not as expensive as places that offer little coverage for a lot of money.  Also you can't beat free coffee or tea every week for a markout! They are big on promoting and training from within. I started as a shift supervisor and went to store manager. I would say though that they are ever changing, so if you are into the same thing everyday you would not want to work for Starbucks."
good,When I was employed with Starbucks I absolutely loved my team! We always lifted each other up and helped one another out in times of high volume or stress. During peak hours things can get hectic but we were always able to pull through better and stronger than before!
good,"Enjoyed my time there at Starbucks. Perfect place for networking and business suggestions. I set goals for my store in sales, in which myself and other partners superseded in completing ."
good,Very great place to work. Enjoyed my time. Learned a lot from my employees and the customers. Friendly atmosphere. Enjoyable job. Fast pace at times but still gives you time to catch up on work.
good,"I'll come out with saying this is not an easy job. If you're considering working here, don't do it if you want an easy job. It is a mentally, emotionally and physically demanding job and you need to be ready for that. Having said that, I love working for Starbucks. The company treats you amazing, and you grow so close with your coworkers, it feels like family. It is a very rewarding job. I mean free coffee every week and free drinks? I'll take that every day. But great company to work for. Just be ready to work your butt off."
good,"A typical day of work would consist of opening the store, preparing the store for business. Ensuring the accuracy of registers, and daily cash deposits. Coaching and mentoring employees. "
good,"Its a great company to work for. The job is fast paced, the environment is amazing, and you learn so much about coffee. The culture at Starbucks is nothing like i've ever seen before."
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work at, provided you have the right management and you are comfortable with constant change. Benefits are extensive and affordable."
good,Great company to work for.  Takes care of their employees and gives opportunities to advance within the company.  The company offers great health benesits to all employees should they choose to take them.
good,Fast paced friendly environment with great partners. The hardest part of the job was managing labor and staffing through out the day. Starbucks is a great company to work for with many benefits.
good,"a typical day at Lowry Park Zoo was prepping the coffee brewer, stocking the display cases, cleaning up my work space and the lobby. Serving hand crafted beverages to the customers."
good,"Es de los mejores trabajos que he tenido, y entra el dicho de ""la gente no renuncia a la empresa si no a los malos jefes"" y justo esto me paso, el supervisor solo da crecimiento a mujeres o al que solo le dice que si y no resonga nada, el trabajo aveces es muy pesado pero es divertido"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty fast-paced, but it is like working with friends/family. Everyone goofs off and has a good time while also working to efficiently finish their tasks. Tasks are divided amongst the ""partners"" (we aren't called employees) so that no one partner is overwhelmed with responsibilities. I learned the differences in coffees from different origins as well how to prepare the different tea and coffee beverages. The hardest part of the job is trying to move up in rank. There are very limited Shift Supervisor positions, and a lot of the managers are pretty slow when it comes to you trying to become a Barista Trainer or Coffee Master. And there is no compensation difference for people who have been there longer. For example, I could work there for ten years and still make the exact same as someone who started yesterday."
good,"Greeting customers with a smile, problem solving and managing time. Managing money, food handling, making drinks, and building connections"
good,"At first seems like too many drinks to memorize but eventually becomes second nature."
good,The company is growing quickly and experiencing the pains of growing at such a rapid pace while being so large. The mission & values of the company when followed are amazing when executed by genuine leaders that embrace the vision.
good,"A great company - not just for the benefits. This was truly a company that became family. As someone who thrives in a fast pace environment, I ended up having a great rapport with regular and new customers alike. One of my favorite jobs and teams I've had the pleasure of working with."
good,"I love working for Starbucks and the atmosphere can really be great. This however, depends on your partners and the combination of the customers."
good,"I love working with the people at Starbucks! They are random and silly. Everyone still gets their work done, of course. Starbucks is very flexible with the schedule and they have many free things (such as a pound of coffee every week)."
good,Everyday is fun at work and the customers are usually very friendly and fun! The tasks aren't too hard and I have good coworkers that help me when I need help with certain tasks!
good,Blink is a different world.. You meet all types of people. There's always something new to learn or to do. I do recommend having tons of energy working at Blink Fitness.
good,Overall a fantastic workplace with dedicated team behind partners and management with enthusiastic support of a worldwide brand.
good,"Starbucks is a great environment to learn and grow as a great worker.Though at times there will be those types of co-workers who will share negative feedback about the way you work, that's the hard part about the job not enough positivity. The most enjoyable part of the job is growing as a Starbucks partner, doing community service, and meeting new people."
good,"Great job, fast paced and pretty fun. I learned many things about coffee, people and how to have fun and remain calm and relaxed during peak hours. Partners really seem to establish and grow relationships with one another which makes coming into work easy."
good,entrei na empresa starbucks .foi muito bom oq aprendi a minha promoçao foi maravilhosa amei trabalha na STARBUCKS
good,The people are nice and it is a great place to work and connect with others and gain new friendships. I have created a lot of connections through this job and it has helped me become a better social oriented person.
good,This is an excellent company to work for and they always make sure their customers and employees are happy and taken care of
good,"Everyone is always friendly. The co-workers are fun to be around, very open and the environment is cultural. I love working here!"
good,"I love working here, my only complaint would be the pay. That's probably my only con. Overall, a great place to work. The people are amazing and the healthcare is pretty great."
good,"So if I'm being honest, I'm a total Starbucks fangirl. I've been a barista for over three years now, and I love every day of it. It's a great company with solid ethics and outstanding benefits, even for part-time partners. If you're on the fence, apply. Trust me."
good,"Loved the fast pace environment. Never a dull moment. Free coffee and fun coworkers. Wish the pay was more, considering the amount of labor and responsibilities."
good,"I love my job at Starbucks! You work with a great group of people, and learn things about coffee (and people) from day one. It gets stressful during rush hours, but after a while of working there, you almost go into a zone and time flies by."
good,"Working for Starbucks was fun because it was a very active workplace with plenty of things to do throughout the day. "
good,"Went in everyday and expected to do my job. Majority of the customers are regulars so you become familiar with drink/food orders. mornings are crazy busy, nights are more laid back and mostly involve cleaning."
good,I haven't worked for many companies but i would have to say Starbucks is the most fun!  You can be yourself and make friends with not only your co-workers but the customer as well.
good,Loved working here! The people made all the difference for me. There are some annoying customers but the good ones definitely make up for it. I absolutely adored my coworkers; they became like family to me very quickly. They made work fun even when it was stressful.
good,"Learned valuable social skills, as well as proper customer service skills. The coworkers varied in competence and ambition, but were adequate, nonetheless. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the environmental stressors, which included coworkers and customers. The enjoyable part would be the bond that was developed over the course of working there, both with customers and coworkers."
good,"Starbucks has great management, advancement opportunities IF YOU WANT THEM (I never did). I have been there over eight years and I've had my fair share of great and terrible managers and shift supervisors. There are great and terrible customers. It's a fine job to have, and career if you want it to be. I'm not interested in a career at Starbucks though, I've been working there during my schooling and think it's time to move on."
good,"get more coffee knowledge"
good,Starbucks is a great work place to work for. I wish the hourly would be enough i would be working for the company still. I was able to further my knowledge about coffee production. Increase my skill with multitasking it was and overall awesome experience.
good,"Starbucks was my first job, so with the little work experience I had- I ended up learning a lot about cash management, teamwork, responsibility, and time management. I loved ALL of my co-workers and built a friendship with each of them. If I looked at the next shift or weeks schedule and saw who I would be working with I would look forward to that shift. Although, the best part of the job was probably the menu, I love the foods and drinks Starbucks offers."
good,"Its been a while since I have worked there but my memoires with the staff will last a life time. "
good,"I learned a lot from Starbcucks, i learned to be patient, understanding and manage my time properly. All of the staff are very attentive"
good,I can't tell you how much I love my manager and co workers. Although the company is absolutely corporate there is a huge focus on the partners' wellbeing
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer interaction. I enjoyed providing customer service and I also enjoyed the conversations with customers.
good,A fun place to work over-all. Depending on the management you have to deal with. Some managers mostly tend to abuse their authority.
good,"Working at Starbucks gives you a feeling of family; friendly work place where everyone tries to work together, and the benefits are good."
good,"Some days Starbucks is the best place to work for. After all the hard work and all the demands of the job, its rewarding to know that you are appreciated. Most management in this company does just that, but like with all companies some people who come into a new area are not always upholding the spirit of the company values."
good,A typical day at worked involved lots of cleaning and dealing with some rude people. I learned from this job how to be pleasant with others even if they were not pleasant with me. I really like my manager and think she has done a great job. My coworkers are one of my favorite things about my job. The hardest part about my job is being nice to people who are not nice to you. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing how happy some people are to get their coffee and being told that I made someones day.
good,"I truly love working at Starbucks. They have great benefits and perks. Its a fun, yet fast paced workplace. We care about every customer and make it a special experience for everyone. The co-workers are like family and truly care about each other and are able to rely on each other. The most difficult part of the job is being able to multitask and do everything at once as well maintaining a clean area. I have been with the company for a year and still learn new things every day. The best part of the job is that everyday is different. The job never becomes mundane. The hardest part though is finding space to grow and advance with the company as there are only so many positions."
good,Worked there for four years and loved everything about it. The just say yes policy put in place not to long ago has torn the company apart. I didn't enjoy that the company became money hungry and forgot about the barista and customer experience
good,Starbucks was a very friendly coffee shop that required lots of up-keep and constant customer satisfaction. We made sure that the store was spotless and the food and beverages were up to the quality and standards that represent the companies dynamic brand.
good,"Working for Starbucks under ARAMARK's management was a very delightful experience and I really enjoyed working there during my college career. Learning leadership skills, team skills, and customers service skills were very useful in every day life and future employment."
good,"A typical day at work consists of opening the store, setting up the pastry case and prepping all of the coffee and food for the day. I continue my day by making beverages and handling the cash drawer.          My co workers are what keep everything flowing, working as a team is highly important. The hardest part of my job is peak, being located near a college and hospital it tends to get fairly busy but with the help of my partners and happy customers, it always gets done with a smile."
good,"I would work here again in a heartbeat.  I loved the job, the people I worked with and the clientele.  I had to leave this job because it was just a college job but, I would recommend it.  It is a great company that takes care of its employees."
good,"You develop a lot of interpersonal skills with the help of management and engagement in customer service. This company is very passionate about their mission and vision and provoke an endless welcoming environment. Moments of connection within management and employees are always present, especially with customer service. I've learned a lot from this company, and each day is a challenge to improve my skills as always."
good,"I enjoy my work at Starbucks very much, particularly the logistical aspects of management. But, the low pay has made the company non-competitive when it comes to attracting new talent and there are almost no opportunities for advancement once one reaches the management suite, which alone could take 9+ years."
good,"I worked at Starbucks for almost five years in five different stores in three cities. One great thing about the company is that it's very easy to transfer anywhere within the US. Even if you leave the company and end up in a position where you have to go back, it's really easy to get rehired- managers like to hire people they don't have to train from scratch. The other plus to the job is that the benefits are great! I had full medical, dental, and vision, a 401(k) and the company gives all of its partners shares of stock in the company. What I didn't like was that I felt like I had no life outside of Starbucks. I worked all the time and the crazy hours got in the way of a lot. Also, sometimes you don't get so lucky as to work with a team you really get along with who works really well together. I've had great teams and terrible teams. Those are probably my biggest complaints. I'd honestly still be with the company now, but I just got to the point where I didn't feel like I was getting anything out of it anymore."
good,"On the whole working at Starbucks was a pleasurable experience, it was a professional and friendly work environment with plenty of opportunity for advancement."
good,"Fun place to work with mostly encouraging coworkers. If you have a passion for coffee, you will love this job. Easy to follow training period and lots of opportunity to advance if one makes the effort."
good,"Making and Learning how to do new drinks, Encountering with customers. Cash handling, wonderful talented team of co workers, helpful management."
good,"Starbucks really is a all it is cracked up to be. If you set aside your personal beliefs and political views and look at the company as a whole, you will find that they treat their employees to the highest standards. Starbucks calls their employees ""Partners"" because not only do you get a share of Starbucks stock working for them, but you are also part of a unique family and ""partnership"" with all other employees. Some of my personal favorite perks of the job are getting free drinks on shift, a free pastry every time I work, and a free pound of coffee and tea every week!! I have worked at Starbucks for 2 years now and have found that in general Starbucks takes the time to find the right management and the right employees for the atmosphere. The hardest part of the job is the countless amount of memorization that comes when you first start working. Other than that, the job is fun and easy as pie. Of course you are going to have your cranky customers like you do in every service industry job, but you are also going to have an opportunity to really connect with your community and brighten people's day by giving them their cup of coffee. I have absolutely no regrets working at Starbucks and will miss my coworkers, my manager, and my customers when I finally move on."
good,Great way to meet people while on a working holiday. If you want more hours you can take hours at other stores which is handy.
good,"Busy and a lot of interaction with customers."
good,"this job was fun and fast pace, loved working with my co-workers and meeting new people on a daily basis. making drinks, satisfying the customers . scheduling employees, taking inventory of product"
good,"I loved working here because you were able to make coffee drinks for yourself so you were always full of energy & everyone around you was always in a great, loving mood. There was always something that needed to be done and i loved that because i love to keep busy. I learned so much about the different types of coffees and had so much fun trying new drinks."
good,"As I said, working at Starbucks was one of my most favorite experiences. I was able to work with some of the most fun people, including management. Being a shift supervisor I feel like i developed great traits in a leadership position. This was a job I know I will never forget."
good,A typical day working there is that you never get the chance to stop working as it is a fast pace environment you get to meet customers and get to know there beverages on the spot. As well Starbucks had a great team workers we pitch all together to help one anther. The hardest part of the job was to know how to make the drinks but time goes by then it got easier to make them. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and to get to know them was the best part of working at Starbucks because not only do you get to know them you also get to see them come back to the store  and we always get there drinks ready.
good,"fine place to work "
good,"I loved working at Starbucks. It was a great work atmosphere and with stable management. Coworkers were easy to get along with. The worst part was when people didn't show up for their shifts, but that's a problem every company faces."
good,I truly love working at Starbucks. The best part is working with people and talking with our guests. That's the environment I thrive in.
good,"friendly staff who are always willing to help you to be best you can be whilst never having a dull moment there."
good,"Cash handle,help coustmers,clean and maintain safe workplace."
good,A typical day at work was fun and high energy. I learned a lot about customer service skills and coffee making. Management was uplifting and friendly. Some co-workers don't want to work as hard as others which was frustrating. The hardest part was stocking which was physically demanding. The most enjoyable part was the atmosphere and getting to know the customers.
good,"In my time here, I found that I enjoy the people I work with. I think the benefits are amazing but the pay is so low that you can barely use those benefits unless you live with a parent. The management is also lacking in ability to lead and that is in all honesty the real reason I would like to leave the company. I can't work for people I don't respect."
good,"A typical day started at 4:30 in the morning and the store would continue to serve customers until much later in the afternoon. the hardest part of being a barista at Starbucks was dealing with conflict that came from customers, but that is where I gained most of my experience with conflict management and customer satisfaction. All of our coworkers could easily get along and work together, which made the job more enjoyable and easier for everyone."
good,As empresas de hoje dão muitas oportunidade e espero conseguir mas e mas .
good,"A typical day was serving customers drinks and pastries while enjoying conversation with customers and coworkers."
good,"A normal work day is so busy that it usually passes relatively quickly. There are systems and standards in place that create an assembly line of sorts that keep things routine and makes it possible to  get back in the groove if thrown off the routine. While in this position I moved up in status and have learned a lot about leadership and what that means for me as a person as well as how I deal with other people and how that affects my work. I have dealt with different  levels and areas of management and or the most part they are respectful and receptive. The hardest part of the job is most likely dealing with the ups and downs of different consumers and workers on a daily basis with grace and professionalism. I enjoy being able to work with people everyday , that is truly the joy of my day and knowing that I was able to do my job well and make some one happy in the movement of my day."
good,"Starbucks provide a great working experience especially for students looking for part-time jobs. Training is extensive and your co-workers are always available to give you any help if needed when you start off, making the learning curve less daunting. Once you've settled and adapted to their work culture and the environment, day to day work could be repetitive and hours of shift could seem long due to that fact. Overall if you're a student seeking a job or you like coffee shop environments, and don't mind repetitive tasks and you like working with a team then this is a job you should consider applying for!"
good,"My time with Starbucks was a fantastic learning experience, customer service and the experience of its patrons what at the forefront of the company. As a shift supervisor with the company I learned that the focus to any business that wants to be successful is to have the customers wants and experience with the company be at the top of there strategy to making steady rises in there finances."
good,Starbucks was a great company to work for. They paid well and were flexible enough with hours and schedules for a while. This is all up to the manager of course and in my experience of working at two different starbucks locations the management can make or break how the store is doing.
good,"i love my working to starbucks i learn how to run the store and i love my customers you can interact with them and your coworkers, the hard part of this job is we have some rude customer but always try to keep a smile."
good,they really care about their employees and customers. They want to make them feel wanted and it ups that they give raises every so often. They really care about their products too and want their employees happy.
good,"Constant interacting with people on a regular basis. Customers are friendly. Can be stressful when first started, but once I've gotten the hang of everything, it's a fun place to work at as a part time job."
good,"the third busiest  Starbucks in the state at the time it was go go go!"
good,"在星巴克的一天："
good,"Trabajar en Starbucks fue muy bonito, aprendí cosas nuevas, a pesar que a veces iban muchas personas y había mucho trabajo, me divertía con mi amigos trabajando, eramos una gran familia, todos nos llevamos bien y nuestros turnos eran muy bonitos. La parte difícil de trabajar allá eran los cierres por la noche, ya que nos teníamos que quedar hasta las 2am, pero a pesar de eso tuve una experiencia inolvidable."
good,"Working at Starbucks was an enjoyable experience and it certainly required a dedicated and motivated mind frame. A typical day included working under pressure and within a time frame to ensure that customers receive the product expected from us. "
good,"Good company that pays well and offers opportunities for advancement. Great environment and staff were nice, as well as the manager who would work with everyone and work with schedules. Things only became stressful when there were many customers at once, since the kiosk is small. Staff knew how to work well together and promptly delivered beverages."
good,"Working for Starbucks has been one of the most fun experiences. "
good,"My first impression of Starbucks was they make you feel like your home.  Everyone is so nice, I felt comfortable right away.  Management and co-workers were very approachable, easy to talk to, and they helped me learn everything right away.  I was so scared trying to make people's coffee because there were so many custom orders.  There is really no hard part of the job, it's just a challenge.  I was able to handle any challenge that given to me."
good,I enjoy working and serving the public.  I am employed through Haggins.  I am going on my fourth year as a Barista.  It is a perfect job to work to help keep you fit.  I encourage this type of job for anyone who love to serve the public and learn or strengthen people skills.
good,As a shift supervisor I was able to experience the management side of Starbucks. I enjoyed working for a company rich with culture and realistic expectations in which teammates are required to follow.
good,"As a store manager, it is my responsibility to create a fun learning environment by managing a staff of 25-30 to ensure the excellent customer service.  It was also my responsibility to ensure the profitability of the store by using the P&L statement to check that total contribution, controllable contribution, and target sales are met."
good,"A typical day working at Starbucks would entail brewing coffee at least 5 times a shift, constantly replenishing supplies, taking drink orders, completing drink orders and working on the cash register."
good,"I learned what it is like to work as a team to achieve great customer satisfaction. I would work on the register and work on the bar (make beverages) on a typical day. I had a great manager who cared deeply about all of my coworkers. I loved almost all of my coworkers, the only problem with my store is that all of my shift supervisors have worked there for 5+ years and could get stuck in their way of doing things. Some customers also can be hard to deal with, but the regulars and the nice customers make up for the bad ones most of the time."
good,"great place to work, great co workers, good culture, pay and benefits lag the market but it's not a place you go for the $, it's for a great work life balance, great product, great mission, etc."
good,"Starbucks has offered me the chance to improve my experience as a professional. Giving lessons of integrity, culture and knowledge to further accommodate customers and professionalism. Everyone does the best the can and works best as a team. The hardest part of the job is the pressure and high volume of customers that flow in and out of the doors/drive thru. (Stressful! but fun!) The most enjoyable part was creating drinks, learning all about Starbucks coffee, and connecting with customers."
good,"Your experience at Starbucks totally depends on the manager of the store. I've worked at three locations and they each have their pros and cons. The corporate culture is great and I love working at a coffee shop with benefits, but the pay is rough- like any retail job. Even as a shift manager, I can barely afford my bills. But hey, tattoos are allowed."
good,"Its always fun coming into work, the customers are so nice and friendly with each other. The management at my Starbucks was terrible. My coworkers are the best ! they are one of the reasons I like coming to work. The hardest part about the job would be cleaning and stocking. The most enjoyable part would be, being able to see customers leave with smiling faces."
good,"O café de melhor qualidade , a força de vontade dos partners , um local ótimo para trabalho , a rotina realmente é boa , a experiência que eu criei junto com os colegas foi fundamental para meu futuro e para minha comunicação com o público . "
good,"I loved working here, and got my taste of Mixology and wish to further my career in this direction.  The only reason I had left was the slow advancement and wage opportunities, was willing to put in double the work by advancing into higher position but would only receive 50 cent raise to this position.  Being a single working mother of Autistic son, and already putting in a full 40 hours every two weeks, I couldn't afford double the workload and not enough compensation."
good,"Everyday starts the same, in having to prep and set up. I label all pastry and sandwiches and then by the time we are done we have the store ready to open. The busiest hours at my store begin from 6:30-11:00am and this can vary, ofcourse.(Flow of customers, Car accidents, Rain, etc.) During these hours, I Bar, Clean, Prep, Restock, Take orders, Greet, Deliver Customer Service to each individual, and also heat food up. It takes a lot out of you and by the end of that rush it almost seems as if a hurricane passed through. Usually, the rush will leave me with things to do for the rest of my shift but if not there are always customers. I really need to give credit to everyone else as well, without my team I could never get it all done and that goes both ways. I love starbucks both as a company and a place to have coffee, but its time i move into my career and leave ""jobs"" behind."
good,"Overall, the most fun job I have ever had! If you become friends with your co-workers, it can almost feel like you're getting paid to hang out with friends, while catering to strangers with your friends. It's a great and fun job. It's extremely difficult at first learning the drinks and adapting to the demand speed, but it's all worth it 4 months later. Oh! and you get tips!"
good,Starbucks had great benefits and we had a great crew. it was a fun job with heavy interaction with customers.Good location company had a great business model and was involved in the community.
good,"The staff were on edge seemed like everyone was happy but, didn't take the job seriously. Breaks by some coworkers were lied about they would leave and another would code in when they got to there destination. The management took time to put action on employees that loadly said they were going to not be available for shifts."
good,"My first year with Starbucks was amazing, I loved my manager, I loved the coworkers. I didn't start to actually love the company until a year into the company and I was brought over to a brand new store that was built. From there I started to really begin my interest in moving up with the company. However less than a year, the manager left to go help another store and stayed there. We were without a manager for 3 months and I believe I really showed that I was fit for a shift manager. I showed that to the district manager, the shift managers in my store, and other managers in the district were well aware of how skilled I was. However I left Starbucks because of stress and pursued a career I was interested in."
good,This job teaches you a lot about customer service and patience. You meet a lot of nice people especially from the area and they are very friendly and sociable. I have learned time and cash handling management. My coworkers look up to me as a supervisor because I teach them to brighten up the customers day. The hardest part of my job is not making a customer walk out with a smile. What I enjoy the most is making the perfect coffee for our customers.
good,"At starbucks you get to meet a lot of different and interesting people from all over the world, its an amazing honor to be able to experience different types of conversations with people from other countries. The hardest part about the job is having to have your coworker be as enthustiastic about the job and the customers as much as you are."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for. Everyone knows the brand and being apart of it is that much sweeter. Being a barista is one of the best jobs that I have ever had.
good,"My typical day would include showing up to work early, clocking in and jumping right into the day. Greet all of our regular morning customers by name and have their drinks ready for them."
good,"The staff is great, management is well organized, and the busy days are the most fun."
good,I enjoyed learning different things and cultures of the different walks of life from the customers to the workers. Excellent company to grown in if you enjoy business and customer service
good,"While working at Starbucks, I learned the best customer service techniques that any job could give.  The store I worked at was a 24 hour drive thru, which could be quite laborious, but overall was an exciting and fast-paced work environment.  Connecting with customers and giving great service is a priority for this company-- something that I truly appreciated.  The hardest part of this job was advancement, as there are not many opportunities to move up in the company past a shift lead.  I enjoyed my time working at Starbucks and I would encourage any young worker to do the same in order to gain great experience!"
good,On a typical work day you are able to become familiar with all your local community member and get to know them by name. Get place for networking and becoming a well known community member. Your coworkers become a part of your family and everyone looks out for one another. I learned that patients and being a team player are important when dealing with customer service and in life in general. Management is understanding to any work/life balance you may be struggling with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the different personalities of customers. People tend to be cranky in the morning. Some people are just argumentative for no reason and believe they are superior than everyone. Its important to be strong minded. The most enjoyable part of this job is the connections you make along the way.
good,Whats not to love about Starbucks. Fun work environment- great learning- COFFEE
good,"Starbucks is a great company and I just began working here.  I enjoy the work, and it continues to challenge me everyday.  In terms of efficiency, A Starbucks Barista learn first hand the importance of multitasking.  From learning coffee, to products, to cadences, making and learning each beverage, while taking care of the customer can get extreme in a days work.  It is a fun, upbeat work environment with exciting coworkers to help keep the day positive and successful."
good,Its a great work environment with a lot of diversity. You learn to be a quicker learner and how to work a fast pace. The most enjoyable part of being employed at Starbucks are the great customers and tips you receive.
good,"From the first time I started at Starbucks to now, I have learned a lot. In the beginning I was scared to make the Espresso/Specialty Drinks...I still have my days when I get overwelmed at the Bar, when their are a lot of drinks; but I am so greatful for the team of people that I work with, that will assist me or anyone who is at the bar, when  we have our rush.I love to here new customers or regulars say you made my day, weather you are ringing them up, making their drink, or assisting them with anything Starbucks....The customers and some of the people I work with, make we want to come to work. For me the least favorite thing for me, the role of Store Support....This person takes care of keeping the store up and running (i.e brewing coffee, sweeping and mopping the store and the back line, making sure whoever is on bar, is stock with milk, flavor syrups, teas, and more, keeping the condiment bar stock for the customers, removing and emptying the trash, and more....This role just takes a lot of you..)"
good,I do not wish to write a review but it was an ok place of work good nice clients and the hotel was sold and closed for few years
good,"I have spent my time networking an building long lasting realtionships."
good,"The work was grueling but, the minute you walk in the door you smell the wonderful coffee, and within 20 feet of each work area there is a full blown coffee kiosk area exactly like each Starbucks store."
good,"Like most people, Starbucks was a job I took because I needed it. I kept it because I loved it. The customers and the partners were both amazing. The skills I already possessed were given the opportunity to grow while I worked here."
good,"A day in my current work is a challenging experience i say..i started as a Barista then i pass for the panel interview for training Lead Barista or Training Supervisor. From barista to supervisor is very different work load, i have learned so many things like how u will manage your time, receiving stocks, updating food management in daily basis, checking emails, sending daily sales summary reports in daily basis. Also we do have some workshop were u can improve your selling skills, improve how to be a good leader, time management. "
good,"Es una gran empresa que se preocupa mucho por la estabilidad  de sus partners (empleados). Todos los días tienes la oportunidad de crear conexiones con tus clientes y contribuir a un buen ambiente laboral.  Con Starbucks aprendí mucho sobre servicio al cliente, y a hacer lo máximo para lograr satisfacción de ambos lados, tanto de mis clientes como propia. Tienes a los mejores compañeros de trabajo, porque se tiene muy en alto el sentido de trabajo en equipo. Lo difícil es que llega a ser un poco monótono y pesado, porque tratas con mucha gente, todo el día. Me gusta de la marca, que es todo un concepto, que te transmiten esa pasión por el café y por el trato hacía las personas, que nunca pasa un día sin que aprendas algo nuevo."
good,very good company to work for enjoyable each day is different
good,"Loved every minute working there, friendly customers and coworkers"
good,"Preparing all the supplies needed for each shift, clean front and back areas, work the tills and the coffee machines, make sure the customer is satisfied. Learned a lot about the products, the coffees, and the moral of the company. Management was fun to be around and co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part was the management change that we tended to see a lot. Most enjoyable was the atmosphere and how fun each shift was working with each other."
good,"The top priority of a supervisor is his/her team. Baristas can service customers best when they have a supportive and knowledgeable manager. "
good,"A typical day for me was to make sure the store was clean, while providing great customer service and well prepared drinks."
good,"This by far is a positive company that teaches respect above all else!"
good,"I truly enjoyed working there, best experience in my life. The customers were the friendliest especially the normal's."
good,"Wouldn't have wanted to work else where, lots of hard work (not an easy job!)"
good,"I was a barista/cashier. I would go to work and make coffee for our customers! I wasn't in the management program, but I was currently in high school so I really needed to focus on my studies. My co workers were awesome! I loved going to work and making the customers satisfied. I would say the hardest part of the job would be only really having one machine to make all those coffees! We got through it though!"
good,"As with different ""fast food"" it isn't great pay. But what's different are the benefit's. The company itself is structured greatly and the people are awesome!"
good,"At starbucks i never face a typical day, what i learned to be positive attitude and my co-worker are really great. there wasn't hard part and i always enjoyed there."
good,"The store I'm at, its like high school, gossip and such. The customers are amazing and pleasing them is the best part of my day."
good,"If you like to have fun and create masterpieces and your thing is coffee, this is the place to work!"
good,This company offers a great package from par-time to management. They provide a great product you can be proud to represent.
good,I love helping and connecting with customers. Memorizing their names and drinks to make them feel comfortable. I was promoted to shift supervisor in 6 months and was able to transfer for school opportunities.

good,"Busy day, and learning curve with drinks and promotional drinks, which is an enjoyable part of the job."
good,"happy place to work most of the time"
good,"•	Provide exceptional customer experiences"

good,If you love people and getting to know different people you will love this job.  The hardest part is being on your feet for long periods of time.  Great on the job training in all areas.  Loved my store.
good,"Starbucks was one of my first jobs, but I stuck around because I learned so much."
good,"My customers are awesome and so are my coworkers. I enjoy opening the store every morning and making espresso drinks. Management can be a little different, but it is always a work in progress. Starbucks offers amazing benefits to workers and takes care of workers in need."
good,Starbucks is a great company to work for.  I've been very fortunate to work with talented partners that I learn from daily.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work i got in a wait on my customers i interact with them on a deeper level ."
good,I learned a lot about people and different personalities...
good,"A empresa era meu terceiro lugar, assim como minha casa, lá é difícil não encontrar colegas que te apoiam e se unem assim como a gerencia, não digo só de uma loja em especial mas em toda a rede. Um ótimo lugar de trabalho."
good,"Everyday was always different. Majority of the regulars are nice and some are picky on how they want their orders. It was a set routine but between tasks and time frames, you can relax and just have fun. Management at Starbucks is great. There is always room for improvement and promotion. I went from being a barista to a shift supervisor in 2 months of starting there but I did have previous Starbucks work at another store. Hardest part of the job is when you're under staff and it gets really busy on your daily rushes. Other than that, The company is great and they take care of their partners."
good,"I love making coffee it makes time go really fast to work so hard and quick. Cleaning was fun, and stocking was always good to see all our products."

good,"Not many people can say they love their job, but I truly have a love for this company and its core values! I am grateful for the experience I have acquired during my employment."
good,"I started working for this company before they were the powerhouse they are today. My typical day started around 5am and ended somewhere around 3pm. I learned many things from this company, I learned to read the profits and loss, to keep variances low enough to have practically no waste. I loved the people that I worked with as well because everyone was so different in terms of where we came from. Most of my staff was early 20's who moved here from different states and countries and I had never lived anywhere but Chicago. The hardest part of the job, were the morning rushes that seemed to last forever. The most enjoyable part of the job was the great feedback I received as well as the experiences I had at the job as well as gaining coffee knowledge."
good,I worked at Starbucks for almost 5 years. I enjoyed the customers and the fast past environment.  It was a challenge at first but once I got the hang of it….Look out!!  Loved it.
good,Great working environment and also an excellent way of motivate people.
good,"Great company to work for. Cdo workers were awesome, very friendly and easy to get along with. Enjoyed going to ork everyday. Customerswere friendly. Our regulars became more like family or friends. We always shared laughed. Fun place to work at. Store manager was a creep.And a bully."

good,It is a fun place where i can learn to play and work with all my working friends
good,They take really good care of their employees. It doesn't feel like you are working for a fast food place.
good,"I love the experience that I have acquired working for Starbucks over the past year and a half. Typically my job as graphic designer is to work as a member of the design team with other industrial designers to create and deliver merchandise concepts to Starbucks, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Seattles Best Coffee and Time Hortons. I have a lot of experience working for international clients. My favorite part of the job is doing trend research for Starbucks and the international market. I currently have work in US and all over the world (Korea, U.K, Germany, Russia and Japan.) Not only am I responsible for the creation of appropriate merchandise concepts (more production based) but I am also in charge of laying the ground work for multiple presentations and mood boards (more design driven layout). After the team creates a multi-page presentation, the client chooses merchandise to go to sample. Individual designers are responsible for the production and creation of that specific item Starbucks chooses. When we receive the sample product back from China we make sure the merchandise is up to par. Then we ""ok"" the sample and it gets shipped to the client. The client then chooses to make any changes or go to MOQ (Minimum order quantity) which can range from 2,000 - 100,000 items. We work for a multitude of clients for every season, all year round."
good,"Starbucks was my first job, which I held for 2 years until I moved from my hometown to attend college. Starbucks allows its' employees to advance as well as such unique benefits such as ""Bean Stock"" (the option of allowing employees stock in Starbucks at a discounted price, if not still offered, it was offered from 2002-2004). Most employees were young students, all enthusiastic and eager! The most difficult part of this job was when I reapplied a year later after leaving school, I was told I was not eligible because I'd left the company the year before."
good,fun place to work discounts on drinks management was always on top of you
good,"Excellent benefits: Insurance, 401K, paid vacation even for part time employees. continual-learning environment that encourages asking questions to improve understanding. Some stores are inherently easier to manage (less sales volume, better application pool, etc) and mine happened to be one of the more difficult. Turnover was high and sales kept increasing by up to 30% over last year. This led to increased job stress which fortunately I was able to take advantage of EAP to seek counseling and treatment for stress and anxiety"
good,"Starbucks is an overall great place to work. I get along with all of my co-workers and both of my managers. The job can be challenging at times but very rewarding in the end. Working for the general public can be extremely fun and very difficult all at once, as you meet various kinds of people. You never know what kind of mood a customer will be in, so I am always prepared for what is to come. I'm a huge people person and my customer service skills are wonderful which means my main goal is to ensure my customers leave my store with a smile."
good,"Starbucks has given me so many wonderful years of experience in the customer service industry. I started working for this company right out of high school and worked my way up to a shift supervisor over the years. I learned so much about working with a team and getting things done. As a shift supervisor I learned to lead my team, ordering and receiving, cash management, and most importantly to take outstanding care of my customers."
good,Starbucks helped me not only learn how to run a million dollar business but grow it as well thur teamwork.
good,Working for Starbucks was a joy! I had fun meeting all types of people from all walks of life.
good,my job had a friendly atmosphere  and i enjoyed the people that i worked with.
good,"Starbucks was very passionate not only for their guests, but for their employees. They worried about our happiness as much as the customers."
good,Working here was great I learned a lot about the good side of corporations and what could be achieved through hard work. The overall attitude was completely friendly and professional. Managers acted like human beings and didn't try to turn you into a machine.
good,"I loved my job there but the managment team was a bit biased. I just wish I would have went into it and been on the ""right team"""
good,"Opened the store at 4 am in the morning, prepared all the beverages needed to serve the customers at 5 am."
good,Worked for the greatest manager of all time. Still think about her and several former employees. Still miss them to this day.
good,"Taking orders and making drinks for a drive-thru Starbucks was difficult to say the least it was fast pace I became main guy on the drive-thru with a positive attitude, quick ears and memory."
good,I enjoyed working in an employment culture at Starbucks that emphasized teamwork and mutual support. I developed as an employee and a person there by working on quick thinking skills and efficient task management. My co workers helped me grow in an environment that fostered development and advancement.
good,"The early morning hours can sometimes be hard, but I really do enjoy the opening shifts at Starbucks. There is so much to do in order to prepare for the busy shift ahead, but by having a good team of co-workers the time flies by. And in the end, its worth it in order to greet the customers, regulars and non, and send them on their way with coffee and a smile. One of the most important things I have learned is building customer relations and maintaing them. People can go to a wide variety of coffee shops for their ""morning fix"" so how do I keep them coming back? With personalized service and a constant level of delivering the quality product that they expect. As a shift manager, it is my responsibility maintain the high level of standards through my performance and to reinforce it through my team. My current manager has been instrumental in my devlopment as a team leader, helping me to understand the concept of taking pride in my work, leading courageously, and owning all my decisions."
good,"Starbucks was an excellent place to work.  The company offered great benifits and a fun atmosphere to work in.  One of the guys I use to work with use to answer the drive-through head set with the line, ""Welcome to Starbucks, the happiest place to be!""  And it litterly was.  I looked forward to coming to work everyday."
good,"A typical day at work was very routine. While working drive thru I would also do dishes."
good,Liked to be at work everyday to see the smiles on the customers face they enjoy my services.
good,"It's a great place for skill building, and learning to be a team player. You work closely with your co-workers to bring the best experience and best beverages to your customers. As a Supervisor, you learn management skills, and cash management. A typical opening shift would include tasks like: store orders; putting away of inventory; running breaks; customer service; count tills; count the safe; counting and delivering the deposit; and running the floor smoothly. A typical closing shift would include tasks like: running breaks; cleaning the store; count tills; count the safe; customer service; make sure the store is set up for the opening shift; and inventory count. "
good,"Es una cadena de rubro restaurante, en la cual es muy conocida a nivel mundial , realiza muchas labores sociales, incentiva al personal y capacita para lograr clientes muy satisfechos, escucha las opiniones del personal y necesidades para mejoría de la empresa. Aprendí a realizar catas a empresas muy conocidas y hoteles, tener nociones de logística, soy encargada de la calidad del producto y servicio, además de tener a cargo entrenamiento hacia partners, tuve facilidades de horario, la gerencia resolver todas las dudas que tengamos, ayudas, etc, si es cansado por la influencia de personas extranjeras y nacionales que tenemos, ya que me encontré en la tienda de Larcomar- Miraflores"
good,"In our typical day of work its always fun and challenging. We got to meet new friends through our customers. We bond as we are a family. We all have sense of ownership.In this place I learned about TEAMWORK and EMBRACE DIVERSITY. My co-workers and the managers are like brothers and sisters we help each other in benefit of the store.Even if its peak hours we do not feel tired, the smile is still in our faces.We enjoy every single minute in our work."
good,Very positive environment with a fast pace. Building relationships with customers. Values held very high. 
good,"I learned social skills and how to deal with customer complaints/problems."
good,"It truly is a fun and great place to work, but I feel that management needs a little improvement, which caused me to leave. I had the most amazing coworkers anyone could ask for. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the regulars that came in. A majority of them really just made up for any rude customers that may have come in that day. "
good,"Starbucks is a great job to learn organization, working with a team and being able to talk to people. Everyday we have sale goals to set and meet, and standards of cleanliness we need to uphold. The hardest part of working for starbucks is dealing with complicated customers. This is because you have to be able to stay composed and handling the situation with staying calm and keeping the customer calm as well. The most enjoyable part of the job is also the customers and the coworkers. This is because you build a family with your coworkers and customers. All of the regualar customers know everyone and care about everyone working at the company."
good,"Retail Sales and service of Coffee, Coffee Drinks, Premium Soft Drinks and allied products in stand alone store. A place where young minds demonstrate their Joy of Learning and Share with Seasoned Persons the Experience of face to face customer service and sales."
good,"un día típico es hacer bebidas que los clientes piden calentar alimentos y convivir con ellos y con mis parnets, aprendes a ser tolerante ya que te encuentras con todo tipo de personas muy buenas hasta personas que traen mal humor y tratas de deciarle un lindo día y algunas de ellas si obtienes una sonrisa y de otras solamente caras. Lo que mas me gusta es el ambiente laboral ya que yo creo que es muy importante para un lugar de trabajo"
good,"A typical day? That's the great thing about working here. It varies; can be spent on back-of-house analysis, or working behind the line, or spending time with customers. I have learned a lot about running an effective business, managing a budget, and hiring the right staff. The hardest part is finding good talent at minimum wage rates. The best part is the camaraderie around customer service and coffee."
good,"Trabajo en horario nocturno, de alta exigencia."
good,"I work in our campus Starbuck within our own cafe. Typically I work almost 10 hours a week. I learned how to make many different drinks and work in a fast pace environment, with a multitude of different co-workers. Many of my co-workers are from different countries, so I have been able to adjust to their cultures and teach them to adjust to mine. I would say that is the hardest and most enjoyable part of my job, as well as serving my fellow student body."
good,As the drive-through supervisor it is critical to stay focused on all 4 aspects of the drive-through and at the same time make sure the client's order is taken in a timely manner and their order delivered according to Starbuck's standards.
good,"Usually work 4am-1pm. Very fast paced, especially on the weekends. I have learned to manage my time very well and be disciplined on running the floor how I feel is right. The coworkers are cooperative and helpful. The hardest part would be keeping up with the sales goals and customer flow goals at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job is the constant human interaction."
good,I enjoyed working here because of the great people you work with and getting involved with the customers and making there day. All it takes is a quick conversation and a great coffee and that's what Starbucks was all about connecting and building a positive environment.
good,"Working at one of the busiest Starbucks in SF means lots of customers and staying busy. While working there I've learned to maximize my time and use each opportunity as a chance to get something done. Management is good, and considerate. I love the people I work with. Thats the best part of my day. The toughest is dealing with rude people who treat you like robots."
good,"Mostly this place has provided me to meet new friends, not just inside of work but outside as well. It made me learn to not just serve coffee but also learning about different types of people. It made me grow as a man and grew more confidence to myself. Management is good. There is nothing hard working at starbucks and I r=enjoy staying busy and meeting new people"
good,typical day is always awesome because of my fellow co-workers. customers are a plus. they always make my day with the smiles in their face after receiving their cup of coffee.
good,"As of last year our k and challenger store received a new manager and ever since then everything has gone down hill. Now all of the employees are treated like robots getting scolded for every single little mistake that we make never being rewarded but harshly punished. our manager does whatever he likes and has no regard for our feelings when talking to us. noone like to come to work now as a result including me, that is why I am seeking other employment."
good,"It's a great job to have cause of the benefits, the payscale is lower than the rate of work you are required to do, but the raises every six months if you do well definitely help, but six months seems like forever when your strapped for cash."
good,"At the time I was in the United States, so the time zone difference made communications a bit difficult. As a customer, they were direct and clear therefore it was great to work with them."
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks beacuse the staff were freindly and i enjoyed the experience i learnt a few things i did not know before
good,"Wonderful family team environment. Experience and culture taken from my time with Starbucks is uncalculable. I had the time of my life and made friends for life.

good,"Assisting customers and making hand crafted beverages are part of the typical routine done at Starbucks. With a great team, strong management and a fun environment, Starbucks is a great job."
good,Working in a resort town is challenging and fun. Never the same thing happens everyday. My manager was amazing and so were my co workers. The most enjoyable part of my day was my customers. I loved seeing the regulars everyday and meeting new people who would become my regulars.
good,I learned a ton about coffee and espresso and beans. About how to make the perfect latte. How to give great customer service and work greatly with great other people.
good,"Overall, this company really cares about it's employees. A typical day involved a great amount of customer service but it really taught a great deal about building relationships with different people."
good,"I have had quite a few jobs since I started working at age 15. Starbucks has to be the one that I enjoyed much more than the others. It was a life experience for me. I learned and experienced more than I ever thought I could at a single job. It Taught me priceless life skills as well as work skills. there are a lot of people that will never know what it's like to work there, and I am happy to say that overall, it is a fantastic job for a young adult that is either in school or constantly traveling and taking time off. You can move up in the company but it takes dedication, patience and hard work."
good,"Fun,fast paced environment. Friendly people and co-workers."
good,"Opening the store was done very early in the morning, but the shift went very quickly because so many customers came in daily. My co-workers were very fun to work with and taught me everythng to be done correcty. It wasn't hard at all to learn all of the drinks it just takes time and repitition. Some customers would come in and make their own drink formula but it was fun."
good,A typical day at for consist of helping people out and making sure that they have whatever it is they came for to get through the day. I learned to be patient with people but to be able to still move at a fast paste. Everything was done as a team even though managers and co-workers had individual tasks. Learning to prepare all the different styles of drinks was the most complicated but i enjoyed everything about what I did.
good,"Loved wotking for company was sad to leave .shift manager. Master barista ,profient in legendary customer service, demanding strong abilities in multi tasking, cash handling, problem solving ,staff management,"
good,Working at Starbucks was amazing! I was there about 7 months and then decided to move up to Shift Supervisor. I learned how to make several coffee drinks. My co-workers and manager were the best! They made it so much fun and I looked forward to going into work.
good,A work environment that feels like working with friends and family
good,Starbucks was one of the best work experiences I've had. a people company. the connections that I made and the values I learned were excellent. A great company to work for.
good,"I learned a lot at Starbucks, there was a good balance of work/life. I enjoyed engaging with my customers daily."
good,"The key to working this job and not losing your mind is your co-workers and your store manager. You have to embrace the ""Just say yes"" mentality to deal with the customers on a daily basis."
good,"The most enjoyable part about working at Starbucks is my customers. I know all of my regulars individually by voice, vehicle, and drink. Before my regular customers get to the window to pay, I try to have their drinks ready to hand off to them and see their smiling faces as they head off to work. Also, I really enjoy my coworkers, all of them are hard working, lovable people, that enjoy seeing a customers smiling face as much as i do!"
good,"Fair, honest people for the most part. I enjoyed the customers the most. The least enjoyable was working nights, weekends and holidays"
good,Working for Kroger over the past ten years has been fufilling and I have made many friends for life. Everyday is different and ever changing with so much turnover in a small mountain town. Training is a daily event in my life at work. Looking foreward to a new career. Currently the hardest part of my job is the unstable hours.
good,"Starbucks is truly invested in the well being, comfort and satisfaction of their employees. Benefits package was unlike any I've seen since I last worked for Starbucks."
good,"Great atmosphere, It's a place to grow furture into the company and even own part of Starbucks. Employees had their rights, Learned a lot about team lead, manegment."
good,"The people are great, your co-workers become like a second family. I would highly reccomend this employer."
good,working for this company was a great experience. learning about different types of coffee and cultures at the same time is very interesting. this company has a way of making there employees feel very overwhelmed and excited about there job.i love the fact that they consider you as a partner instead of a regular employee and also makesyou experiment with the different of drinks and products.
good,Starbucks is a great company with many opportunites.
good,"Starbucks offers a one of a kind work culture, and also offers excellent benefits. The monetary compensation is subpar at best. Ultimately, I thought it was a great job."
good,"Excelente ambiente con compañeros y jefes, muy buenas prestaciones, un lugar perfecto si deseas estudiar, pero prepárate porque es súper agotador y estresante."
good,"When it came to working at Starbucks, the only thing that really matters is the people you work with. If your team is excellent and you're having a good time, the customers will have a great time. Everything will run smoothly and orders will be fulfilled in a timely manner. The team I worked with felt like a family, as cheesy as that sounds. We were a well oiled machine! We kept the store clean, customers moving and the drinks flowing, nothing felt better. I had a blast!"
good,Building relationships with customers was the most enjoyable part of this job. You see a lot of the same people each day and you become apart of their extended family
good,Starbucks is great company to work for because of its flexibility. I believe it’s the perfect job to start working. Great partners to work with and have a solid relationship outside of work.
good,The particular location I had worked at happened to be in the top 5 busiest Starbucks locations in the world. No joke. I had practiced my multitasking capabilities as well as my customer services skills there is always something new to learn. I was challenged daily but my work ethic was strengthened and for that I am grateful.
good,"Es un excelente trabajo para iniciar una vida laboral formal, es con gente joven y dispuesta a trabajar en equipo aunque por las edades muchas veces no se sabe dividir lo personal de lo laboral."
good,"Great team, great energy. Not all stores will be the same, but this one is fantastic to its employees and its customers. You are never made to feel like you cant ask any questions when you are new, which makes it a great place to be trained."
good,"Working at Starbucks is a great job. I've transferred between two locations, my first was terrible. The one I am at now is terrific. Working at  Starbucks can be great, it really depends on which store though. At my current one, my manager is helpful, respectful, understanding, clear as to what our expectations are and understands her own job perfectly. My co-workers all try their best and join me in making the experience as good as it can for our customers. Our benefits range from free online-college to a variety of insurance. I hope to continue working at Starbucks as long as I can."
good,"I highly recommend this position to someone who needs a flexible work hours, Especially students. The pay is enough as a part time employee that you can go to school and work and its worth it to juggle both. I personally used Starbucks as my day job and bartended at night. It was a great balance."
good,"Overall it’s a good company to work for, the hours are tiring and the pace can be extreme but the training is great and so are the benefits. Management can be good or bad depending on your store."
good,"Uma empresa muito boa em relação às atividades exercidas, só que é muito trabalho pra uma remuneração baixa."
good,"Excelente ambiente, se preocupan por tu bienestar particular y tus metas como ser humano. Buen compañerismo."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, the fast paced work environment really pushed me to my mental limits  many ask how I was even able to handle the job it was not easy but it was good for growth"
good,5years strong and I couldn’t imagine leaving. Meaningful connections with coworkers and customers.A little hard to move up if you dont have a background in management but is possible
good,Love working here and there are a lot of great accolades to take advantage of but not a great job if looking for full time. Very flexible with your work schedule so could be a great second job.
good,"If you like Customer Service and a fast pace work environment, you'll like it here. Its also nice to not be stuck with a particular uniform and have some individuality. 10/10 would work for the company again."
good,"I worked at Starbuck just for like 3 months, honestly its one of the best coffee organization I have had the opportunity to work for. The management criteria is so organized and handy. Would recommend to never drop the chance of working at Starbucks."
good,"Good work place with passion and full of energy"
good,"Overall, Starbucks is definitely a good place to work far as working with a great team, acquiring guest service skills, and great personal achievements."
good,My job is a good place to grow as an individual in many aspects as far as leadership and building healthy relationships. From starting as a cashier to a supervisor has built my confidence as well.
good,"Often times you see many people who work just for money and go home, if that’s you my suggestion is not to apply here. It is a lot of work and you need to memorize a lot of things, so if you want a job where you get paid for doing nothing, this is not the place for you. We are a team and as cliché as it is, we are as strong as our weakest link."
good,It’s good treating your baristas like family and making a differences it’s fun to see how much impact you can have on so many people to make a difference
good,"Great part time job, good benifits. Would not recommend full time as hourly pay is not livable wage unless they have changed since I have worked there. Regulars really make it a fun place to be, drive thru can be stressful, morning shifts are fun but very busy they can be intimidating for a first time Barista"
good,Really taught me how to keep my customers happy. The variety of people whom I worked with was great things as well. I also had so.e great managers to rely on weather professional or private
good,"I love working for Starbucks, I'm always learning new things at work. "
good,"Starbucks is a great company to work for, they care about their employees and are always ready to improve. it is a labor intensive job but worthwhile!"
good,It was great my coworkers especially were the ones that made it all OK at the end of my shifts every day. We could have had better management but we made it work.
good,I love that its a safe place for children when they are lost or in danger. Its also a great  place to make a daily routine with options to build you net-worth at the same time. not to mention as a barista you get to be the one to help people start off their day on a positive note. its a power Starbucks taught me to wield wisely.
good,Great job that allows you to work as a team and get to know the public and the world of coffee. It is very flexible in terms of coordinating your personal schedule and your work schedule
good,It is a pleasant place to work. It prioritizes the right things for employees to focus on what is needed to successfully organize the best type of customer service experience.
good,"The management is very orderly and structured while also very accommodating; as long as you responsibly contact the store manager and shift leads about your needs in schedule changes, they are always happy to make the change or work with you to help you get what you need to get. All the employees are also super friendly and fun to work with, although the Starbucks I work at is the busiest one in orange county, so it does get stressful sometimes."
good,"This was my very first job ever, worked there for 5 years. Overall the company itself is amazing. incredible benefits. when i moved back from VA to IN i transferred stores. but then i transferred to a different one based on location & the mangement was not the best so decided to leave. in a different circumstance i would go back"
good,"Met some amazing and wonderful friends at Starbucks, but the customers are often times rude and ungrateful. Taught me a lot of patience, and how to handle difficult people."
good,Working there was a wonderful experience from working with great team memebers and management they never made you feel not appreciated and that’s important
good,"Working for StarBucks is great because  they really care for they Employees and they benefits is out of the world, and they are really flexible with your work schedule  and real life balance"
good,"respectful management and employees, interesting project. transparent corporate culture. Slow adoption of new technology. No parking. supportive environment."
good,"Just like most retail jobs, the hours are variable and off-kilter with other people's ""normal"" schedules. Generally, my shifts could start anywhere from 4am onwards, and would end anywhere up til midnight or so later on nights we did sets for promotions and holiday, depending on what the particular store's hours were. There was no such thing as a set schedule, even as a store manager, and week to week, day to day, my hours would flip-flop."
good,This is a great place to work if you can keep up and stay calm during the crazy! This job made me a better person and furthered my skills I’m so many ways! Miss this company and what they stand for!
good,"Good Place to work, I liked the busy environment. Getting to and from work was hard some days having to commute back and forth. I had gotten stuck on the train many times and late."
good,Es una muy buena empresa para trabajar siempre existe la capacitación y nunca dejas de aprender no está difícil aprenderse todos los procesos el chiste es aplicarlos y con mucho empeño para ser la mejor
good,"I loved working at starbucks. Great for a part time job."
good,"Good job okay management, barista position included cashier and coffee making, have to deal with public and handle customers complaints, all in all a good job"
good,Working in Starbucks as an barista was one of the best jobs I’ve work at my co worker’s was amazing and always helping and working as a team to making the company strive I’ve learned a lot there and build some great relationships with my costumers I recommend Starbucks to anyone for a job
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed working for this company. My management team is great, and I really enjoy the customer interactions in my day to day life. I think it is a great place to work, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone in need of a job."
good,"Everyday always had been random, something new happens everyday.  most days would be simple with the regulars showing and enjoying a delightful conversation.  Best experience i would say would have to be when a customer would ask for something different, allowing me to be creative, and the look on their face when they enjoy what I made."
good,"I've worked here for several months it's pretty fast paced, training is woefully lacking everybody basically learns as a trial by fire. But its a nice place to work especially for a food service job. pay is meh, but at least you can see a Dr."
good,"Starbucks culture is one of a kind.  The managers genuinely care about their team, and everyone is treated with respect and dignity.  The work load could be demanding during peak hours, but overall this was a great job!"
good,I had a great boss and Had plenty of training so i felt sufficiently prepared to do my job that was very refreshing to be apart of a work culture like that
good,Very nice work experience..awsome  ...the salary was good.nice company joint alliance with Tata.. very freely work environment..nice culture in restaurants..
good,I enjoyed my time at Starbucks.  I had a great team and a great store manager and ASM that I worked for which really helped everything run smoothly. My coworkers were awesome too.
good,"Changing seasonal beverage every 2-3 months, with exciting promotions almost every weeks. So much fun serving the customer, seeing their smiles and thank yous for their delicious cup of coffee and a slice of cake."
good,Love work for the company enjoy meeting different ppl making drinks.very diverse management could be more better very high turnover. Need at least one more store in the airport
good,The job helped me to obtain effective communicative skills that are requisite for a manager and the ability to manage depending on the situation demand.
good,"Working at Starbucks was wonderful. The environment was friendly and it was such  fun job, you definitely have room to grow there and everyone is respected and the management was very kind and helpful. Training was very good, you always learn new things and I loved working there!"
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks very much. The management and staff were friendly and understanding. The customer service was amazing and the training is beneficial for future success. There are opportunities to move up in the company also.
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was how informal we kept it, like a tight knit family. always made sure everyone got home safe and hung out together on our off days/after hours"
good,"Overall, If you are into a repetitive work environment, with steel toe boots and a hard hat, while working long days and extra hours, Then this is the job for you."
good,"it’s not only a job, it’s a family. things may be difficult but with the right support you will make it through. they are there to help you grow and you truly do learn so much other than how to “pour coffee”"
good,Management sucked at the Travel Plaza. Crew had drama. i had gotten free meals. the walk down to the plaza sucked in the winter time or in rain. people were creepy that i had to deal with as customers.
good,"Alshaya is a company of opportunities that allow staffs to grow,the job security is superb if the staff follow the rules and regulations,my excellent in customer service gives me more opportunities,I was carefully in handling cash and I never had any problem with cash shortage or over."
good,Das arbeiten im Team macht mega Spaß. Man wird sehr viel unterstützt.
good,"Starbucks was a great company to work for as a student or even as you grow into a different career, this would be great for part-time income. I loved working for this company."
good,I enjoyed working at Stabucks.The atmosphere drives it's partners. I miss many of the customers. Pay is not great. Free pound of coffee was a plus. They never gave 40 hours a week unless you were in management.
good,"Bij Starbucks kon ik makkelijk mijn privé leven combineren met mijn werk zonder problemen. De relaxed werktijden was heel gunstig voor mij."
good,I enjoy every moment of being a Starbucks partner. Great experience in a dynamic fast paced environment. Starbucks has gone through of change. The business is full of talented partners who are true innovators in a fast paced industry.
good,Starbucks is a fast paced work environment with the goal to provide excellent customer service and an incredible coffee experience for customers. They have fantastic benefits and lots of free coffee!
good,"A typical day at work is busy mornings, lunch rushes, and post work rushes.  Calm work, but always on your feet. Tips are good if yiu are good at your job, make coffee quick and smile."
good,"Starbucks did have its cons, but the pros outweighed them. I got to know so many people (partners and customers), and I developed so many skills I never would have learned otherwise. It is a great job to have at entry-level, but ANYONE from any age group could benefit from Starbucks. Couldn't recommend this job more."
good,Great management. Fast paced. Friendly staff. Realizes the importance of developing real life skills in all employees. Benefits unlike any other. Competitive pay.
good,Working at Starbucks is all together a great experience. I love my work environment from the staff to the consumers and the feeling I get when I’m inside any Starbucks store but especially my own store. Coffee brings people together and this creates a feeling of love and warmth I’ve never experienced anywhere els. The benefits are great because I have chances to learn knew things and move up in the company.
good,"Me encantó trabajar en Starbucks, aprendí mucho, lamentablemente tuve que renunciar por proyectos universitarios 😭 💔"
good,"I have worked at a few locations around the Twin Cities, and would 100% recommend Starbucks as a company to work for. The culture is very relaxed and diverse. It is a perfect place for part time work, and for anyone in university. Management has always been kind, flexible and understanding. The discounted product is an absolute bonus, and the wages are good."
good,"Was a great company to work for.  I did start when the company was smaller and a little more personable.  However they still kept their values as best as a company that big can.  Great place to get experience and continued education in the management department.  Pay is slow going though and review process my last time around the District Manager said that because I was an Assistant Manager for 6 months and only a manager for 2 that I would not see a raise.  Well I was a manager for 6 months and only an assistant for 2, when I pointed this out he said it was too late and that he couldn't change the raise because it had already been processed.  That is the kind of things that happen at such a large corporation."
good,I would love to return to working for the company if possible. I never truly wanted to leave and miss it very much. The company treats its employees very well.
good,I enjoyed working at Starbucks and loved making new customer connections. My favorite part was making someone's day by either listening to them or making their favorite drink.
good,A great first job for those who enjoy interacting with new people everyday. A typical day can be eventful or peaceful. I recommend this job for people new to the workforce or college students who need a very flexible job with amazing benefits.
good,It was ok. The managers were cool. Just a bit boring. If you clock in before 5am you get an extra dollar per hour. HMS Host was the company. Inside the airport.
good,"A very good working place to learn, grow and evolve."
good,Great Place to Work!! If you want a company to help you pay for college this is the place! Nothing negative to say about the culture or management. I love the place! 110% best job I ever had.
good,"I've had the best times at starbucks, it taught me everything I need to know about customer service. The ability to multi task and give great service, being a leader day in and day out and just satisfying customers and making sure thet leave with a smile on their face"
good,"Although it was busy and very fast-tracked. everyone enjoyed working with one another. we were like family. Typically the morning shift was very busy and you have to be quick and consistent in every aspect. Must be able to multi-task. The hardest part was clearing a line early morning on the bar when there is a full line inside and outside. Most enjoyable part, the environment you create with coworkers."
good,"Fun environment and great management team and learning about coffee was very knowledgeable, was able to be transferable to other stores, great perks with a good discount"
good,"This company gives its all to you except a life. Once you move beyond a part-time partner, the expectation is that you live and breath the company. And sadly, the benefits are great if you have family money to actually live off of on a daily basis."
good,"I worked for distribution for almost 2 years. It was great. However the overtime around the holidays gets pretty overbearing and you quickly can start to feel like you do nothing but work. The company however will do lots of thing for their workers such as giveaways, catering, free lunches, and a whole bunch of other stuff. The benefits are really nice as well."
good,"Enjoy working here. Fun place for mothers , students and retired people. "
good,"Starbucks is a very fast paced, very stressful job for all levels. "
good,Great job to start off with but not to grow with a lot of drama with the employees its fun for a high school student but managers are rude But most co workers are fun
good,"A lot of companies encourage goofing off by providing game stations and rec rooms, yet discourage passion for work. Starbucks headquarters is not like that. The people in my team, and the people whom I work with, all have a real passion for their job, and welcome anyone passionate about their work too."
good,Wonderful job! I loved it there. Very flexible on scheduling and everyone is very friendly. Was fast-paced and fun to keep you on your toes. Highly recommend working here!
good,"it definitely is hard at first, but as you progress and learn, everything just rotates like clockwork. I love the connection that I have with my co-workers and customers, I have met some of the most genuine and beautiful people at this job."
good,"I learned about stock options, health insurance, customer service, and time management skills while working with this company. I met plenty of individuals that i still associate with and had a wonderful experience."
good,Working at Starbucks was like having a safe environment to preform tasks well under pressure with co-workers that felt more like family. it was a very hard job to do but it has been my best work experience so far.
good,Most of your day is spent communicating with customers and helping them with any questions they may have about the drinks or food items sold in store. In between helping customers you will be doing a lot of cleaning as well which makes the day go by even faster in an already fast paced work environment.
good,I moved up in Starbucks very quickly. I was given opportunities to learn at my own pace and grow as I became comfortable in the store and with my coworkers.
good,"Not gonna lie, not every person will find this work as fun ad attractive as I did, because there will be a lot of lesrning, starting with the day 1. Sertifications, tests, seminars outside of working hours( being payed) and an intense working process is what this job really is. It is hard and takes literally all the time, that is why you will not stay there for a long time unless you are passionate to what you are doing. Sadly, I had to quit the Starbucks I worked in within moving away to a different country to study, but I will always remember those times filled with smile on my face, and I hope, I will be able to enjoy my next work as much as I enjoyed working in Starbucks."
good,It’s hard to maintain work life balance because of the constant need to appear to work in case of every minor problem. The salary for this kind of job and responsibilities is definitely too low.
good,"A typical day of work at Starbucks was having a different start to each day, but ending the day with the same routine. Somedays I would jump right onto the cash register, while other days I would go straight to cleaning. I enjoy a clean environment to work in, which Starbucks is very considerate about while providing their standards. It gave me more experience to communicate with costumers and co-wokers while also teaching me to have excellent cleaning habits. I do not mind cleaning so it was not too hard for me, but the most least thing I enjoyed was deep cleaning the bathrooms. I would say the most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with costumers and stocking items. It also showed me that I should never be afraid to ask questions in order to become my best self."
good,"I love to work as a barista because I am not only learning about how to produce coffee but the most important thing is we learned how to be patient and always down to earth in order to develop personal skills management in the real future life,,"
good,"The only down fall is work life balance. Overall great culture and they have amazing pay, benefits, and vacation packages. I would recommend to someone who is able to dedicate a lot of time to work."
good,"If you want to work hard, keep busy, yet have fun then Starbucks is a good place to work!  I chose this job as “my happy place” and it has been!"
good,"A typical day at work involved a simple process that was listed and easily accessible. I learned how to be readily available for customers, and the ability to multitask efficiently."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo muy bueno, todos colaboran y te motivan"
good,"Working at Starbucks was a great experience it allowed me to grow so much as it was my first job. It is a very fast paced environment and it showed me how to be patient with others, how to work as a team, and most importantly how to great a welcoming and friendly environment for partners and customers."
good,"Typical day at work would be fast paced and very busy. I"
good,"Always on the move, trained me in coffee master, learned many organizational and merchandising skills in my time there which lead to me becoming the Siren's Eye Lead. Good place to work, the pay could be better, the scheduling could be more consistent."
good,A typical day at work consisted of preparing the store for the entire day ensuring there was coffee brewed. That we had the fridges completely stocked and all supplies we needed were in stock as well. I learned to work more with a team and how to depend on one another to succeed. The most challenging part of the job was merely the morning rush when people are in a hurry to work or school or whatever it may be and all you want to do is ensure that you make their orders to their satisfaction and then some. The best part of the job was the interaction with customers on a daily basis.
good,Starbucks was a different scenery for me seeing how I wasn’t a huge fan of coffee.  But learning the different types of drinks made it was a pleasure working there.
good,I loved working for starbucks! The management is where it started getting rough. Starbucks is a great company to work for with the right management team!
good,"You get to work in a fast paced environment, as well as learn a lot about the product they sell. You interact with customer on a daily basis and cna form goo relationships with your co workers"
good,"The best part of the job is connecting with customers and partners."
good,"The people there (employees and guests) made the job worth while. It was a long haul, so that’s the only reason I decided to leave. If it weren’t for that, I may have been there longer than I was."
good,a typical day could be stressful while you where there but at the end of the day you could go home and sleep easy. I learned a lot about team work and supporting on an other both at work and out of work. I found the hardest part to be the face pace that everything goes at but I loved always finding time to connect with customers and enjoy their company.
good,Difficult place of business but it keeps you on your toes and alert about all of your surroundings ! Not recommended for anyone looking for a first time job. Overall a great place of business !
good,Fast paced at times but manageable. Friendly staff. Great manager. Good wages and benefits. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know repeat customers and making a positive impact on their day.
good,"2 years of work experience in leading IT, finance, and manufacturing projects through all phases of project life cycle including initiation, planning, monitoring and execution"
good,Avoir l’opportunité travailler chez Starbucks est une opportunité et une chance de pouvoir évoluer au seins dune entreprise avec des valeurs et des intérêt communs entre ces partenaires  quelque soit leur postes au seins de l' entreprises .
good,"productive, fun, fast-paced, attention consuming. I learned to  deal with each customer with patience and a smile. The hardest part of the job was pairing beverages and foods depending on the taste of each guest. The most enjoyable part was the fellow employees."
good,"During my time at Starbucks, I had a few managers. I had one that was very good at his job and making sure his employees were doing their job efficiently and helping out in any way possible to make the store and team run smoothly and collectively. Then I had a manager who had no Starbucks experience but managerial experience through a restaurant and tried to run the store like how she did at a restaurant. She never complied with any workers and their needed time off, never gave the schedule in advance until the night before a new week, never made sure the store and the team were in the driver seat to be successful during busy hours and days. The last manager I had was a little better in knowing Starbucks protocols and keeping his employees up to date with what we needed to know. However, when it came to deploying a team, he did it incorrectly and never had the store clean. I would come into the store in the late afternoon and see the store a huge mess and customers constantly complaining to me about how the store was not neat, condiment bar stocked, and trash cans always overflowing. Starbucks needs a better look at who they promote as managers. There are obviously some great ones who deserve the job and those who need more work and should be trained better."
good,It’s nice because you get to interact with people as well as practice being professional. Learning different drinks and how to manage yourself in busy hours.
good,"Starbucks had great pay and flexible hours to make everyday life easy without having to worry about your schedule all the time . Benefits were great, and you got to meet all types of people"
good,a typical day at work consisted of keeping the team positive and busy while giving guest the best possible experience while inside or outside of our store.
good,This is where you can truly see what makes a good team and a not so good team. This was hard but rewarding work. I enjoyed my time there and continue to visit. I would encourage anyone thinking about working there to give it a try. Still a daily drinker too!
good,Bar area is alot of working and moving fast. Stocking your area and keeping it clean. Working registers your going to be talking alot with the customers and making sure they know about are drinks and there food. Handling money and making sure they leave in a good mood. Starbucks is all about making the customers feel at home and want to come back.
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work, especially if you're flexible, like to have fun, and want a good work-home disconnect."
good,"Work hard"
good,I worked at several locations including one of the busiest in California. I was able to make an positive impact on someones day  over a cop of coffee.
good,"Routine is important at Starbucks - understanding your role and working with fellow baristas and shifts is crucial to a productive day. It isn't just about setting the standard with our products in a timely manner, but also about creating connections with the customers and with each other. We balance making drinks with quality service every day."
good,Starbucks is a wonderful company. It has multiple perks for each employee. It allows for a quick paced environment but also the collaboration between the employees creates a successful day at work. It allows for employees and customers to connect and gain a better sense of others lives.
good,"Always something to do, "
good,fun place to work just keep up with the flow. you meet some cool interesting people. you get a whole variety of culture coming through every day. always busy.
good,"Great environment. They really care about their employees, customers, and the world. I loved talking to customers and getting to know regulars. I loved working there!"
good,Starbucks is a multicultural company great for young adults stepping out into the work field looking for decent pay great benefits and easy advancement.
good,This Is a place I would like to work for again and would always like to be a part of. My co workers were awesome and the costumers were always awesome to communicate with. I would love to work at Starbucks again.
good,Starbucks takes great care of all their employees. I loved working for them and they offer so much for so little work. The benefits are almost impossible to pass up.
good,"i worked in a high volume store with short staff. it was always busy but with good teamwork, we always pushed through. Plus, it's nice to get all your drinks for free after a rush. :)"
good,"My tasks were enjoyable and kept me busy without stressing me out, excepting the morning/afternoon rushed we got. I got along with most everyone, but did feel patronized at times—the culture could have used more encouragement. I really liked my benefits."
good,"I really did love working there and it was an awesome environment, but there were situations with management at each location I went to, every single location had their own problems with management and at the very last store I worked at, the manager just wasn't what I expected and made my job there feel very repressive."
good,"Until I felt like I should have been promoted to shift manager after being a barista for 4yrs and Hard Work."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Starbucks as a Barista. Everyone worked as  team,but we also had great challenges and competitions within the workplace that would push you to be better and do better as an employee. "
good,"Starbucks is a great place to work. The benefits are excellent, and the corporate culture is kind and supportive. After working there 18 months, I was eligible for benefits that allowed me to take paid time off for medical treatment, and return when I was well."
good,"I loved my live in Starbucks since the first day. Busy environment where I met and unbelievable boss and her assistant, where I also met two very good friends now running that same store. Plus every other store had its magic. Good times"
good,I love everything starbucks stands for but their management is awful. I worked their for years as a shift supervisor and left because of it. When i decided to go back part time i left once again because management was so bad i went four weeks without pay because something was over looked on my paperwork.
good,"I loved working for Starbucks. It was always so fun creating yummy drinks and making people happy. I do not work for this company anymore, but I miss it dearly."
good,"If you get a store with a strong crew, the training and support is wonderful. I was given several days to get up to speed on tasks. The culture is focused heavily around product knowledge and personal excellence which is great. The only complaint is that the company itself changes its rules and regulations often."
good,Great place to work safe and helps to pay for school management great and always face paced but not stressful health insurance for part time and match 401k
good,"Typically it is a fast paced work environment, though it is pleasant to work with the majority of the other partners. You meet new people and some become regular customers and you get to know them better."
good,"Although strenuous, quick-paced, and lots of information to digest, Starbucks looks out for their employees. Being able to get your first degree, them paying for/compensating for sudden disasters in your life, affordable insurance, matching 401K, stock options...it's an amazing way to kickstart your life and really get everything on track."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Starbucks but they fail to provide performance raises."
good,One of my favorite places to work and have fun while doing so! This is a diverse culture..no judgement zone.  Where creativity meets community. If you ever want a job that's enjoyable...Starbucks should be at the top of your list
good,We did have lots of new managers but it has been the same one for awhile now. I made some really good friends and connections. I always try and go back to visit its for sure a good environment.
good,"A lot of changes I’ve endured over my 6 years at Starbucks. Overall I loved it, I started when I was 17 years old and I learned so much. It’s true, you don’t get paid for your experience, but in college it was great to get free drinks and discounted food. Starbucks taught me a great work ethic that I’ve carried into my current role as a sales manager in hospitality."
good,"The only thing I can complain about is we have to split tips from the whole week, meaning we add up all tips divide , then you get a number as low as .86-1.30/he depending on  location or just week .. then whatever that number per hour is multiply the number of hours your worked to get the amount of tips you will receive ."
good,Overall a great company. Management struggled at the location I worked. Work environment was positive almost always. Multitasking and quick thinking is crucial for this position.
good,I have worked there for over 6 years and refuse to leave because of all the benefits! I work two jobs only because I love the atmosphere so much. Great company.
good,Great place to work where you feel like a big part of the company. As a barista you have the capability to make decisions when it comes to helping out a mistake that may have happened with a customer. You are given the responsibility to show what Starbucks is truly about.
good,"Loved working at Starbucks, the people are almost always nice, at least where I was working, they encourage creativity and having good time while working. They want the customers to have a good experience and for you to make it special every time someone walks through the door. This makes it very easy to establish a good relationship with new people every day."
good,"I love working for Starbucks, however if you are looking for a company where you can easily promote, this is not the place. Great place to make lifelong friends."
good,Good place to work but better management is needed to make Starbucks a better work environment for the company an employees. Earning stacks is helpful as well as college funding available.
good,Starbucks was my first job and since the first day I've loved it. It's been over 4 years and with my older manager she was great. I recommend working at Starbucks for everyone just for the experience.
good,"It was hard busy work, but everyone was doing the same things.  They accommodated by older person speed and limitations and I enjoyed the customers and the shorter hours.  It was first experience in food service and found there was a reason I had always had office jobs.  I wish I had faster memory and hands."
good,"Starbucks is overall a great place to work. Despite the stressful customer experiences, the regulars made every day worth it! Coworkers come from all different backgrounds, and it's a great place to make friends with everyone, from management to your peers."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work for meeting new people whether its coworkers or customers. The company has high expectations that are easily achievable and always provides a great working environment.
good,"Great position to learn to lead and grow from.  Company needs to currently stop hiring outside when many talented shift supervisors are wanting to move up to management.  Right now the current DM has hired many young white women as assistant managers  from outside the company instead of promoting different ethnic groups/sexes  from within the company that have the experience, drive to move up.  Always seems to be the same profile she hires. And everyone notices."
good,Starbucks is a great place to work if you like fast paced work while having to multitask and possibly deal with very rude and cranky people. I work with amazing people that have become very good friends and they make it all worth it!
good,"This company is progressive, an d strives to be the best at quality of product, knowledge of product and in development of every partner to meet their full success."
good,"I loved the quick-pace to the job, and had incredibly friendly co-workers. Overall, my experience working at Starbucks was pleasant and I'm actually a little sad to say that I didn't work their longer."
good,This job definitely challenged you to work on time management as well as deliver great customer service. I very much enjoyed the rush and being able to provide not only coffee but develop relationships with our customers.
good,"The company was very flexible with my school schedule. Management was always supportive of my actions and it was always a lot of fun. It was a learning curve getting into coffee making, but became very exciting soon enough."
good,I really enjoyed working at Starbucks. It was at an airport and we had a lot of customers so the work day would go by fast. My coworkers were really great as well. My store manager was the only one I had a problem with. She didn't respect my time off for school so I ended up quitting.
good,"I was severely underpaid at Starbucks for the cost of living in my area. However, if you work here 20+ hours a week they will pay for your college degree through ASU's online degree program. Please take advantage of it. They also provide incredible benefits like free spotify premium, insurance, 401K match, receiving pay check as stocks with a 5% disc., among many others. It is a fun job and you learn a lot about efficiency, great customer service and marketing. Many of my coworkers were so fun and genuine. "
good,"Amazing benefits, free school, free grants, very very good insurance- you only need to work 20 hours a week to keep your insurance. Very flexible to your personal life. Great staff consistently.  Overall pleasant company."
good,"ambente comodo , equipo de trabajo unido , constante aprendizaje"
good,"As a teen who needed to manage school and work and save up for moving, this job was good for a steady income. The only issue would be how fast paced it can be can occasionally become overwhelming, so I wouldn’t recommend someone who gets stressed easy to take this job, but otherwise it was very good!"
good,"It was fun to work there, made many long-time friends from there and my manager was awesome, plus I got as much coffee as I could drink as well as a weekly make-out of coffee."
good,I enjoyed working there it was a cool building experience and a good start on making money. I liked it. I liked working wish I had more hours tho. Again was neat
good,"Es una muy buena empresa para laborar, con buen ambiente y buenas prestaciones, únicamente que la sucursal en la que estaba el trabajo de octubre a marzo si se vuelve pesado ya que se atiende a una gran cantidad de turistas de cruceros todos los días."
good,"Have to attend all kind of customers, most of them get angry without reason by early morning itself."
good,"It's always busy at Starbucks. Meeting people and making their days brighter is the best part of the job. It takes a while to pick up on the drinks and recipes and techniques but it is very worthwhile. As with any job, you get your good managers and your bad managers."
good,"Working with Starbucks for 15 years, allowed a wonderful networking platform and incredible friends that are still in my life!"
good,"Loved the coworkers, making drinks was fast paced as well as a learning opportunity. Getting to know the regulars that come in everyday was the best part of the job!"
good,El ambiente laboral es muy bueno y los horarios muy flexibles.
good,"Honestly one of the funnest places I've worked - Starbucks treats their employees amazingly, giving us room to do things our way and bond with our teams. I left for an opportunity in my field, but my store will always hold a special place in my heart."
good,"Overall, Starbucks is a great company. But how much you'll enjoy working there definitely depends on the manager you work under. It's hard to get more hours sometimes and only making $9 (or at least that's how much I made at my store) just doesn't cut it in this economy. It's a great job for students though. Most managers are very flexible and want you to succeed in school and beyond. If you can handle standing all day, fast-paced environments, mild stress, and sticky messes, this job is a pretty good one and will prepare you for the real world. Plus the free pound of coffee every week is just too good to pass up."
good,"In my short time with Starbucks I was able to become a shift supervisor, an intent I had in my interview to start. The management, all the way to the DM, had a hand in ensuring I was properly trained as a barista and given opportunity to build towards being a shift by 6 months (the required time to be promoted after starting). I had my shift interview and got my position. It didn't stop there, I wanted to learn more and potentially become ASM and was given the tools to work towards it. "
good,"I had an amazing 4 years with the company but recent management changes made me unhappy and I decided it was best to venture out of my comfort zone and find some place else. I do miss it and recommend the job to anyone. "
good,"Everything was great except a vindictive, petty manager, she basically ruined the job as well as the work environment. It was far better when she wasnt working, we'd all visibly relax and there was less tension."
good,Las personas contratadas son sometidas a exámenes psicometricos por lo cual se busca un buen perfil en los trabajadores por lo que se genera un ambiente tranquilo y amable con las personas que ingresan.
good,Starbucks is a great company and the employees bring across a happy and relaxed atmosphere in the stores. The customers are always happy to be there and very understanding. Hardest part about the job would have to be keeping up with the pace on a busy day.
good,"We are passionate in what we do. Leaders are great and our focus on customer connection."
good,you get to drink as much as you want which is great because they keep you on your toes! you work hard and have to work fast but honestly I loved the vibe...
good,"I worked at Starbucks for over 2 years, It was great, we became like family, our store went through several managers, the last manager was HORRIBLE! So much I can say, But he picked on certain people he didn't like and would fire people literally over nothing. He would write people up over clocking in 1 minute past regardless of the situation. When certain women would refuse his advances he would look for ways to write them up to eventually fire them. This is all FACTS, and when several of us reported this, it all fell on deaf ears. He was backed by the DM. I love the company but not the people in certain stores."
good,Starbucks has great benefits. its a great company and worked well with you great hours. fast pace great customer . love how they make you feel like a family. I would work for this company again
good,"The company has developed a culture of acceptance and effective communication for employees and management. It is not difficult to encounter relatable people within the store, whether it be customers or co workers. The difficulties with the job are mostly with volume of customers, which is definitely something which newcomers must adapt to. What I enjoyed most about it was the welcoming environment."
good,"It’s a really good job if you’re just trying to earn some extra money. They start you out at 9/hr. You get a 3 free drinks a day, a free pound of coffee a week, 30% off discount, and you have the option of going to college online for free, basically. After like 2 years of working there, the stocks, basically free money that they give you, vest. You get tips every week. All that good stuff, but you may get burnt out like crazy, which is were i am right now after being here for 3 years. It’s not always fun and games. It’s a stressful job, I’ve seen people cry because of this job. Customers talk to you like their crazy  and probably throw coffee at you. Good luck, and may the Siren be with you!"
good,"Very inclusive atmosphere, very easy to do school with this job and people are generally friendly. I enjoyed working here and would recommend it as a first job with school and stress."
good,"Great place to work, but manufacturing is the red headed step child of the company and doesn't get the love the stores do. Opportunities for advancement exist, but many prefer to stay in their roles long term."
good,"Lots of fun if you enjoy working as a team. Company is great to work for and treats its employees well. It can be tricky to learn bar at first, but once you have a grasp it becomes second nature."
good,"Préparer des sandwichs"
good,Great working environment. Free coffee and free lunch too. Amazing benefits. Flexible hours. Always working as a team. Fast paced. Fun place to work 😊
good,Uma empresa que abre portas para jovens se iniciarem no trabalho.Uma empresa responsável com seus funcionários.
good,"Poor managers. I was fired for being late after my car broke down and was stranded to wait for the tow. I was in contact with my manager the entire time, but lo, when I arrived to the store I had a referral with my name written on it."
good,"starbucks, une entreprise où il fait bon de travailler"
good,"Starbucks offers great benefits for part time workers. This includes medical, dental, vision, and college. An upbeat environment where great friends are made."
good,"I worked at night so typically I would be cleaning front of house and helping customers. In my opinion the only thing I learned at the store was how to make the drinks, only because I already have great communication skills with people along with customer service."
good,"Working at Starbucks allowed me to build and maintain relationships with other employees as well as customers. It was a great place to learn how to work in a fast paced environment, while still acknowledging and appreciated customers and coworkers."
good,"The workplace stresses discipline and speed. Everyday one handles their share of the often 100+ customer rush, making coffee, keeping a smile, and working hard together. The management was strict but fair, and quick to help when one is in need. My favorite memories often involve my managers and their fair style. Laid back isn't the word I would use to describe it, but the moments where I could slow down and spend a few minutes talking to my coworkers were that much more special. I enjoyed the environment."
good,"Starbucks was a fun environment to work at, very busy at times but it had its breaks, plus free coffee is a plus. They also offered one free food item per day per shift."
good,"I enjoyed it. Super fun. Worked really hard, it was hard to get at first but I persisted and it worked in my favor. Super duper fun job and really rewarding. Great coworkers."
good,"A day at work was usually very busy and productive. Constantly meeting new faces and building relationships with regulars making work fun. At starbucks you learn alot of different skills that would help with any other job as well such as working register, making drinks and preparing food and inventory."
good,Typical day at work is making over a 100 different types of coffee. I learned all the different ways to blend an make coffee an how to work a cash register. Hardest part of the job was dealing with three different rush hours a day. Making the different types of coffee was simple.
good,"The hardest part was never being scheduled, always having to wait for a text or call to come in and fill in.  Not being able to successfully preform my skill level on the bar.  Also hearing the manager talk bad about other teammates."
good,typical job at Starbucks. i learned a lot of what to do and not to do. i never thought making coffee would've been so much fun! The culture was very diverse.
good,"working with different culture of people enhanced you with knowledge  system and education . Understanding work place "
good,its a fun fast paced job with great customers and coworkers. The mentality at starbucks is always positive and fun they really care about their employees.
good,"A typical day at work will start with going over our daily goals, viewing the daily schedule, and delegating tasks. I have different situations everyday which keeps me on my toes and looking forward to every challenge."
good,"Being a Starbucks Barista teaches you to be extremely efficient and knowledgeable of store products. I would say it's the best job for the customer service experience."
good,"The place taught me more things than I thought I could learn. It not only taught me coffee making skills and gave me coffee knowledge, it also gave me communication skills and good colleagues to work with which made my working experience even more worth it."
