rating,review
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,It deeply hurts to say that thermofisher scientific being the most reputed company has this kind of poor management especially in customer service apart from that i feel the job is really good
bad,"Not a good company & culture. Very stressful. "
bad,"fast pace with no forgiveness. its an okay company. you are constantly monitored for no reason. the benefits are great. the discounts are great however, management only looks at everything you're doing wrong instead of right!"
bad,"The STL site of Thermo Fisher is part of the Patheon services group. The culture of this company is horrendous. It’s a good first job and they are willing to hire recent college grads. Every “ism” is rampant here. Sexism, racism, and nepotism will prevent anyone different from the boys club from advancing. The pay isn’t great but you will work so many hours you will be okay. Plan to make it a pit stop in your career journey."
bad,.they just dont care and team leads in clean room ARE RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL if your slower...the money is good but being HAPPY and respected is more important...dont do it!
bad,"high manager turnover at all levels."
bad,"Not a nice place to work. Always on the edge. Very stressful. No communication."
bad,"Weekend overtime has been mandatory for years. You work every other weekend, so 12 days in a row with no break. People keep quitting, and management doesn't get why. The operators are burnt out. So they bring in an outside company to tell them how to run their own company. Isn't that what upper management is supposed to do? It sounds like they are going to 12 hour rotating shifts soon. No thanks."
bad,The stupid parties are very judgemental racist and they don't like to give you good reviews their management is poor the formulation and finishing department for third shift their very close minded the very unprofessional and very judgemental and I think they're racist
bad,"If you don't have a family and don't mind working 10+ hour days it's ok. The co-workers don't really work together. The production team orders equipment for other shifts, only for that shift to return it without using it. Had to have the equipment to them within 60 minutes of time of ordering but the stuff could be laying anywhere. The pay is terrible, good thing there is always overtime."
bad,"High stress and low rewarding environment. On paper, they mention the importance of work life balance but not in reality. All that matters is numbers nothing else."
bad,Want to much with little pay and there are only a few that get the pass. They say they will hire within for leadership positions but only to who they like and not what the person knows. To many people leaving and they don't as why or really work on improvements from their surveys.
bad,"Bad management, and horrible work environment."
bad,"I was in this very position at this site in Bedford, Mass. for 20 months, before 9 out 14 of the R&D staff were let go or quit, due to the worst possible managerial staff ever to exist in civilization.  AVOID THIS SITE AT ALL COST, or suffer the consequences of a very hellish experience.  They have a track record of over 20 years of this behavior.  They are a 4th string player in the global biopharma resins market.  I would rather be starving along the side of the road than to have every known these creatures who claim to be management in the Bedford R&D site."
bad,If you need a job go there but if not stay clear I was used for more than my job and paid low for the distance I had to travel if you don't live close to them you'll have to deal with travel time
bad,"It's hard to schedule any off time. You are sharing a schedule calendar with 3 other call centers in 3 different states. Management harasses you on a constant basis. I have a medical condition and I had to get a doctor's note just to be able to go to the bathroom when I needed to and was still harassed by management. There QA is horrible they threatened you on a regular about everything. This is not a good place to work at all. The money is decent but it isnt worth the effort, time or the headache"
bad,"I worked in IDC deportment it's waste i never seen such depot"
bad,"Performed DNA synthesis for Monsanto, Regeneron, Dupont, and HID products purchased by the FBI. Daily tasks include gas phase cleavage and deprotection, formulation, UV Vis Spectrophotometry."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"Awful place to work would recommend as a last resort only. Very poor in fact no existent management, they are clueless and stumble from one disaster to another. Workers are not important to them they just want as much out the door as possible and if you have concerns you're simply told to leave if you are not happy. 90% of staff I would say want to leave. Woefully under staffed and they don't care just tell you to get on with it and accuse you of not working to your potential. Which is amusing as you are not given the chance to work to your potential."
bad,"The start up pay is decent and the benefits are good but it doesn't pay off. They are insanely under staffed, because they can't get anyone to stay, so be prepared to pick up the slack. They only operate on one shift even though the work load is more than one shift can handle and your shift doesn't end until everything is done. They are not generous with raises. To put it in perspective, there is a guy there that has worked for the company for 17 years and still only makes $2 more an hour than some just walking in the door. Everything in the warehouse is outdated and constantly malfunctioning making the work harder and your days longer. It doesn't take long working there before it becomes pretty clear why they have a high turnover rate."
bad,No really good environment to work there. They lay-off people. Coworker has no good communication. Not really organized. Team leaders and supervisors are not friendly
bad,"The management team over inflates your sales quotas. They add a minimum of $20K to every rep as a safety blanket. So many reps don't hit target because of this. The company is run by people that have very low ethics and morals. I've seen management bully individuals that are close to retirement. They only do what's best for them, not the employee.There's a reason why they are constantly looking for sales people, everyone leaves for something better. The Canadian region once hit over 100% when only 1 manager hit plan that year and by barely 100%,. How can a region hit 102% when only 1 manager finished at below 101% and all the others were below 99%? That's due to the hefty hedge added on to every single sales reps plan across the country. What a low move to do to your employees. BTW I would have put 0 stars but you're forced to selects at least 1 for overall rating."
bad,"Financially driven with poor investment in factories and people.  Constant fear of being fired so a high staff turnover.  More senior positions - none last more than 3-4 years.  Appears like a multi national company but in reality lots of independent sites and MBD is a poor relation to other divisions. "
bad,sobrecarga de trabajo y mala paga no promueven al empleado
bad,"VRIENDJESPOLITIEK, GEEN LEUKE SFEER, werken onder tijdsdruk, geviseerd worden, uitgedaagd worden , enzovoorts"
bad,"Lack of clear direction and a very weak and incompetent management team. Roles are not clearly defined any many people are checked out. You will get burned out if you try to make a difference. All the positive reviews about the Burlington,ON office are falsely manufactured."
bad,"used to be good company but since Life acquisition has turned into a dog and pony show.  Not great place for women to work.  Complete all boys club, no idea how to handle smart women."
bad,"ThermoFisher sucked out my soul and made me cry everynight. Nothing was ever good enough no matter how hard we pushed or how much overtime we worked, yet the top dogs would always preach work life balance thought there was none"
bad,"Everyone is jumping ship.  Employee and management turnover is a revolving door.  4 years of negative growth, and not a positive environment.  Micromanaged to a debilitating degree for positive, impactful performance.  Quantity over Quality = unattainable goals.  Inadequate managers, poorly trained."
bad,"ThermoFisher tries to say they care about their workers, but in the long run it's about pushing the product our the door at any cost.  I'm surprised that on a daily basis there are not more injuries due to the tigh working conditions.  It's a job and the supervisors and workers are there to make a dollar and go home.  If you're out of line or don't 'fit"" in then they fire you.  They care nothing for the warehouse worker it's only about the bottom line."
bad,"They followed the GE model during my time there: 10% of the employees laid off every year.  I made it through 10 years of that.  Never again. They do not support individual work/projects, there is really no reason beyond personal satisfaction to strive for excellence there.  It was a very unpleasant work environment, very chaotic."
bad,Just like every other day at work. New skills within job role. N/A. Just like every other workplace probably. Communication. Shift patterns are difficult to adapt to. The fact i get a free gym membership.
bad,"This place will lie and tell you anything to get you in the door. Work you so much unless you upper management or work in office/ lab your find. Production over head is the problem. This place will have you working crazy hours. Warning, worst career move your every make.  Also the work culture is horrible."
bad,zeer slecht bedrijf om voor te werken en alles is slecht geregeld
bad,everything about thermofisher is horrible do not come here at all. horrible pay and working conditions. I would never recommend this job to anyone even if you were down on the dumps.
bad,no matter how hard you tried nothing was ever good enough. management was constantly trying to change our production process everyday. would of been better to try new ways for a few weeks then weed out poor techniques and incorporate new ways to improve production
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"Cheap company, doesn't care about their employees, they expect to keep people while paying peanuts. The turnover in the Ottawa office is unbelievable, in very department. People can't wait to leave. I've lost count the amount of times I noticed employees searching for new jobs while on the job...."
bad,"Every decision seems to be made out of chaos. Top level management has turned over significantly. The company also talks about valuing diversity, yet they entire work force continues to be white and male dominated. They are more talk than action."
bad,Worked at the Cramlington site for 3 weeks. Had no skin on my fingers because of blisters. Hated every minute. Left to go to SCA in Prudhoe which is the most physically tiring work I've ever done. Six months working on a production line and used toilet once in that time because I sweated so much. But preferred that to Thermofisher. Clean room conditions for rubbish pay.
bad,Not healthy place to work. Poor management. Unable to see the big picture. Would promote the lesser qualified employees. Co-workers are unpleasant and backstabbing.
bad,"You are only a number here, nothing else."
bad,"The way that facility is run is very unproductive and very cut throat. "
bad,"Overall this is a place to receive some benefits and a paycheck. The culture is disconnected meaning everyone typically is too busy to really speak to anyone else due to the call volume that is usually always busy. Everyone seems like they are unhappy and rightfully so because the way Management runs the place is really disappointing."
bad,"They have no sense of work life balance."
bad,"No career growth, poor management skill, benefits is good, compensation is very low, negative work culture, no support, I wouldn't recommend working for Thermo Fisher"
bad,Would not work for them again. Place is cutthroat and full of back stabbers. Management fosters that attitude and encourages it. The pay is low and moral is even lower.
bad,This place is a joke. All the employees are contract except management. They lie to you and say they will give you a job and end up laying you off. I was a Test Technician and they had me doing manual labor in the warehouse. So your job skills doesn't matter in this place. Extreme high turnover. This place is always hiring and they use at least 20 staffing agencies
bad,The management here is horrible and they don't care about the temporary employees. Managers walk around saying cuss words. It's unprofessional and not recommended to work here
bad,long and hot doing the summer time.I did learn a lot working there.Management is bad.work culture is bad.the hardest part of the job is everything.no enjoyable part of the job
bad,"Terrible place to work, everyone's attitude was bad. If you didn't fit in with the crowd they'd make working there miserable. Plus they fired me right before Christmas because I was working there thru a temporary employment agency."
bad,"An independent thinker who searches for my own solutions. Always on the lookout for new opportunities and new concepts."
bad,"One of worse places I have encountered in my work experience. The lack of direction and not able to drive a product. Very high turn over rate, unable to keep the talent. Poor upper management and can,t seem back off and micro management. Director oversteps the manager and changes designs , without understanding the system."
bad,"Hands down the most negative, toxic, and outright hostile environment I've ever worked in. The lack of direction, or anything resembling support from Leadership is shockingly bad."
bad,Just dont. Horrible place to work. HR is terrible. All the employees are miserable. They cant keep emloyees to save their life because of how they treat them. Its not worth it.
bad,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is not a place for someone that is trying to move up in the company. One could easily work there for many years but not get compensated fairly, risk illness because of some of the chemicals you work with and  become complacent. There are some good people that work at thermo that have supported their families for 30 years but they will tell you that there is rarely room for advancement."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,this company has the worst management EVER they don't treat everyone fairly only if you are a favorite do you get your voice heard the only ones who get anywhere are the ones that kiss butt and lie to make them selves look good
bad,I learned the work picker/packer and data entry andI had been good workplace culture in the  different area zone  I hardest pat of job and managerments
bad,They treat their employees horribly after you're there a couple weeks. Hr is useless. They openly discriminate against pregnant and handicap people. The warehouse boss is a horrible guy incompetent and big headed. In the few months I worked there 5/6 people quit out of a 25ish person warehouse staff.
bad,"work as chemical packer,labeller,machine operator filling chemicals in the bottles etc.Company is near to my house medical facility paid vacation provision is available."
bad,Don't work here they lay you off with no notice at all. Manager at Cramlington is rubbish. They make up loads of lies. Go for a decent job where they appreciate the staff
bad,"controlled inventory"
bad,"Pay not very good once your hired in, supervisors not very friendly to new employees, the employees make it hard for you, takes along time to get hired in."
bad,"unethical management, they do not walk the talk and speak poor of peers, superiors, and team members   Bonus paid to upper level on how much they can hold back from employees"
bad,"very unfriendly and cut throat culture. Staff is very rude and ready to go off on you the minute you make the smallest mistake. Management  expect you to be perfect but they don't focus on the fact that they aren't there for their employees. I recommended to start some kind of recognition program but their response was "" why recognize, it's their job"". Really not a great place to work."
bad,"Worlds worst culture in a company.  Very clickish and unfriendly."
bad,"Very stressful environment, a lot expected for little recognition or pay. Management very one sided. Very unethical and unprofessional environment. Most co-workers are friendly, but so busy, worked there for 4 years and didn't even know most of their names."
bad,The Management team needs to step up. The way they run the place is ridiculous.
bad,The culture of this company is based on not what you know but who you know. Each supervisor manager surrounds themselves with employees that are afraid to criticize there inabilities and cover up mistakes.Those who do not follow this culture are removed from the company.
bad,Thermo isn't a place to work because the management will take advantage of representatives. The Regional Sales Manager in the Kansas City market took a reps new car and gave them his because he felt he needed more than the representative.
bad,Great on training for all product lines. will work with you if family needs.
bad,"To my knowledge, this company is no longer in business. Their downfall was the hiring of friends and family and NOT qualified people. If someone with good skills came in, as a temp, and tried to apply those skills, they were quickly dismissed. This seems to be a common trend among New Hampshire based businesses and contributes to the increase in operating costs."
bad,"Expect you to be on time, and if you're not on time for the interview because you were lost they don't care. Called the interviewer several times that I am lost, but she never picked up. Finally 3hrs later when I reached there, she said all the interviews are over, even though I said I was lost, she told the security to tell me to leave. The next day, I emailed her, and told me yes I got your messages but when you called I wasn't in the office, and now all the positions have been filled (even though the website said the position is still open)."
bad,"This is a soulless company who will use your body then fire you for being unable to work. Bad managers, horrible hours and short breaks. Life tech hires mostly young, untrained contractors to handle dangerous chemicals and work long 12- hour shifts. They work project to project then are laid off. This is not a long term career company."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"Great company and products, but customer service is disorganized and there is a lot of cronyism in hiring and promotion. Do no be surprised even after year or two of strong performance you are passed up for a promotion to an external candidate who posts a picture arm in arm at a party with the hiring manager on the company intranet. Lack of diversity and middle to upper management. Lots of changing of processes and procedures without communication to employees. Customer service reps are required to report errors against each other which does not foster a good team morale. Supervisors send emails with poor grammar and punctuation. Due to the poor job market in the area, the company can get away with this. If you do not have a connection within the company, only work here as a temp until you can find something better."
bad,"Better than being unemployed, but sadly not by much.  The pay is horrendous for anyone hourly.  The bonuses promised are never received, and there is a great deal of stress put on your shoulders for very little incentives."
bad,"This management at this company is the most unethical I have ever encountered. Hard work is punished while favoritism runs rampant, especially if the younger females have physical relations with their male manager/supervisors, and the female managers/supervisors are no better. HR will defend the wrongdoer vigorously, even in situations where the behavior is illegal. Don't work here."
bad,This is a horrible company go work for. They treat their employees with no respect. After the hurricane they had the entire crews working without ventilation in the building. In a chemical environment it is vital to have the proper ventilation. They had no regard for the employees. I was an operations manager there and I stood tall to protect my crew. This is why they let me go. I tried everything in my power to protect my staff and the company resented it.
bad,I will never recommend anyone to work here. It is extremely ghetto and the people are very disresectfful
bad,did not value the worker as much as they did money. to make more profit 400+ people lost there jobs.
bad,I didnt think alot of this company.
bad,My team job was making sure inventory counts were correct.And pull work orders to be ship all over the world.
bad,"Poor mgt structure for such a multi-billion dollar company! Minimal input from hr to support staff, staff retention was horrendous..... recruitment were bad too!"
bad,Zwaar werk. Hoge tempo van het werk. Altijd kan sneller en sneller. Collega's zijn niet aardig en helpen je niet.
bad,It is not what you did but what HR thinks about you.  The 2 NJ sites are the worst place I worked at.  HR cannot be trusted.  They have no integrity.  Both sites are revolving door.   HR is the main reason employees are leaving.  My immediate boss and I left because of HR.  The Sr. HR manager got to go. The HR manager at Bridgewater left because of her.  I will not recommend these 2 sites. - they SUCK.
bad,"Company has been going down hill, management does not care about lower level employees. This year to avoid paying  a bonus to employees to get volunteers for holidays they are making production level employees work Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. The people that handle pay never get your pay correct and make you go extended periods of time without it. Gave us a bonus and then made us pay back half of it."
bad,"A typical day included assembling different types of medical bags. There are three different departments in assembly. Tube sets, 2D, and 3D. Even though we all have the same mission, have the exact same job description, and are reminded every single day that the company works as a ""team"" 3D department gets paid MORE then the other two departments. The company worships the 3D department, and if there is any overtime, 3D gets first pick in what hours they want to work. They are aloud to come in early while the other departments have to stay later. "
bad,"If you want to be treated like a child here is the place to go. I currently work in steriles, and to say that the atmosphere is beyond toxic and mentally draining is an understatement. In order to even get an ounce of respect from your lead you must be a favorite. Only favorited employees are able to learn new things, and basically do whatever they want. "
bad,If your are not white stay away from this place. They treat minorities awful and will not offer the same opportunities as white people. They only upside are the days of the week you work.
bad,"What should be a stable company, is not.  Please refrain from applying for the MSD Division in the Madison location.  Workplace culture is virtually non existent and employees are not compensated fairly for commitment and advancement potential."
bad,"Mangers are treated very badly.  Lots of politics.   Disrespectful feedback.  These guys wait for a small mistake so that they can destroy you.  Your job is always on the line. "
bad,"managment is a joke"
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"Don’t recommend if you want to advance your career. They do not care about your previous experience. They only care if you went to college. Even with no experience if you have a degree this is the place for you. Horrible leadership with no care of their employees, they treat everyone like a number that can be replaced with a robot. Leadership is clueless and lazy with no sense of direction. Would recommend to stay away from thermo fisher unless you want to get treated like a number and they don’t care for anyone. Especially in ADP. Leadership needs to change for the better. They are all horrible."
bad,Big company with good benefits.  Our division is experiencing some bumps and management is overly micromanaging.  but the mission is  worthwhile and it is fulfilling work.
bad,"That was a statement given by the CEO at a general assembly of all the workers at the Marietta, OH site.  This is the attitude the management team took when it came to the culture of the work environment as well."
bad,i have worked in this industry for many years and this is the first company i have noticed that there is different rules for everyone in the building and that one person can have something and the other can not it is a cut throat get it down we do not care so much for safety  just get it done
bad,"The sense of overwhelming and soulless bureacracy at this company can make you feel sick to your stomach. Unless you love being a brown nosing yes-man, you would hate working for this group of people."
bad,Place is very unsafe and they pay garbage for what you gotta do. You work with chemicals that can kill you or prolong long term health defects. Place is very poorly managed and you only get your 40 hours a week. No overtime and no career advancement. It’s like being in prison everyone takes a break at the same time.
bad,Immature co-workers will make you feel like you're in high school all over again. A lack of job security will make you fear of losing your job over small mistakes once they feel the need to terminate people to increase profits. Beware.
bad,Management are idiots.  Too many lazy employees. Trainers don’t know what they are doing. Long hours. No advancement opportunities. Favoritism with supervisors and their pets.
bad,"Sem prioridades, extremamente desorganizada, implementou sistema ERP sem qualquer planejamento, direção unica e exclusivamente preocupada com a auto-imagem."
bad,stressful treated unfairly always got more work dumped on me while others would stand around socializing.  I would not recommend this company to anyone who wants to be treated fairly.
bad,Not being able to communicate effectively can harm workers and the company. Communication is key to every aspect of growth and growth there seems to be lacking.
bad,"This company is hungry for inorganic growth and achieve necessary results for wall street i.e. to keep investors happy every quarter at any cost."
bad,"Unfortunately when ThermoFisher arrived at the site they absorbed too many services and put them under the ULS brand. There was a lot of talk going through the hiring process of cross training within different services but those words were empty statements. The only way to move up within this company would be if any one above would leave and everyone was pretty cemented within their positions. They put a lot of the wrong people into positions that they had no business being in the first place. Program Managers and Department Supervisors were not aware of the low morale going on with the program and their main purpose was to feed the ego of the Director and HR Manager. This contract was way more than ULS could handle but they came in and undercut cost that other companies were paid to do the services at this site. It was all about cost cutting and doing what you can with a bare bones crew regardless of the employees who kept the business running. I would not recommend anyone to work within the ULS brand, you would be better off looking else where."
bad,"Fast Paced"
bad,"Management were  really not clear about my duties, pay is bad and he kept in negotiating rate."
bad,"Whoever is a Line leader, Team leader, are not at all competent. Lack of practical understanding of basics for Planning and co-ordinating with the team members.  Line leader and Team leader here are always in hurry to prove themselves competent to superiors and make the environment much terrible and stressful. No planning of work at all. Whenever a person raise a voice, they are treated like a revolutionist / protestor and will be on the list of fired from the company soon. "
bad,"i work here in canada for more than 10 years now,but this company, is the most racist ive ever encountered,no system,workers are mediocre and lazy..you want to know more? try it…"
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"The work is easy enough, however, where safety should be first production seems to come first. There is very little if any positive feedback for jobs done beyond production projections  there production goals. Just very poor moral overall."
bad,"Excellent if you want to go back to jr high. No teamwork- most people are all about themselves. Outdated computers and tools. Unrealistically expect over 100% efficiency every day with zero errors at such a fast pace....and it's never, ever, good enough. It's a popularity contest there, so good luck. No parking there so you'll be expected to park out on the street. And overcrowded breakroom and working conditions. They keep it cold in the clean room so bring a coat."
bad,"Gaslighting is a norm with the Organics Manager. She thrives with having people at each others backs, tattling on each other. Within 16 months I witnessed 6 women over 50 get pressured into leaving the company with the use of overworking them to point they began making mistakes, the mistakes became exaggerated by the manager who used the instances as them not being good enough and put them on probation.  Once on probation they had to jump through hoops where they were responsible for things that were not even in their department."
bad,Cambios en la manera de pensar no se llevan a cabo muchas herramientas de la manufactura esbelta... Todo se maneja por medio de celular nadie anda en piso por lo mismo no conocen el campo que es donde deberían ponerle atención... Gracias
bad,if you want to work a job where they don't care about their employees this is the place for you! Management is horrible and they try to take advantage of you as much as possible. Very low staff and 1 person does the work that 3 people would normally do.
bad,The Auburn site has very little HR help in any event and it is structured around the business versus the overall bridge for employees help! This has been a long term issue that no one will address!
bad,"Pay wise among the lowest if you start off. Boring job too. I do not recommend this place unless you are a old lady or uncle retiring with a rich son or daughters earning 5 digit to feed you. I remember there is some senior technician name Peter who is unbelievably bias as a senior tech in charge and did not set a good example too. Need to carry his balls and clean his shoe type. Lots of foreigner working there not willing to teach you. Lots of politics from them too. Arrogant chee ko pek guy lazing behind the the cleanroom behind too. "
bad,"Undercover racist as the call center manager right now, they don’t listen to their employees, they try to swipe things under the rug & they don’t treat everyone equally"
bad,"This site is not run to the same high standards expected of other Thermo Fisher sites. Poor senior management are part of the issue here."
bad,Stressful environment. Management is not supportve. Management enjoyed people sucking up to them. No consistency in how each employee was treated. There definitely was favortism.
bad,"Even for a temp position, working for this company was awful. The pay was barely worth the time (including the commute I had to make of nearly 40 mins) and the management was less than stellar. I ended up quitting the contract after a supervisor tried to have me do something against SOP. I called her on it and she lost it on me. EXTREMELY unprofessional to say the least. When it was brought to the attention of management, she backed up what the supervisor was trying to have me do (keep in mind that this supervisor had been there forever, so go figure, plus she was doing a job that no one else in their right mind would do for the pay). Absolutely ridiculous! I would not/will not ever go against policy, I don't care who tells me to do so. Needless to say, I did not have a good experience whatsoever here. The only good thing I can say about the place is that the employees and other lower management were wonderful, very hard working people. I was only sad to not be able to work with them any longer."
bad,"It's easy to get a job here as they don't pay that well which does not attract well seasoned professionals. Poor management, substandard equipment and poor workflow complicate the job."
bad,"This place is a joke you are expected to work until the job is done as a picker with extra work loads and always shorthanded, Which makes it rough. Management is horrible they never help out even if shorthanded, sometimes they leave for the day but the employees still have to finish the job. The pay is terrible and pretty much .10 cent raise once a year.  There is no employee hand book so they say, but they make rules up as they go along or if something happens, they only looking out for themselves as owners and managers and treat you like we are not people. I would never recommend this place to anyone, wouldnt want to hurt someone's career and life by going to this lowlife dead end job."
bad,"No structure, No leadership, Nobody knows whats going on day by day and nobody really cares about anything.  I should have stayed at my last job or just applied at burger king."
bad,"ThermoFIsher, like most large corporations these days, could not care less about its employees. Management is so out of touch with the workers on the floor who do actual production that it would be laughable if it wasn't so pathetic. Entire departments have been laid off and then rehired a few months later due to management's lack of foresight to remember the natural ups and downs of manufacturing work. Management would rather have a contractor complete their 1 year working at ThermoFisher and train a new contractor than hire the original as a FTE even though it wastes everyone's time to continuously train new people. If you are good at your job they do not let you transfer departments because you are too valuable an asset to be allowed to leave. Combined with the fact that management plays favorites (over personality, NOT job performance), there is little to no realistic job growth options. Every job is a rush priority with an extreme sense of urgency, an inhuman amount of work is expected to get done each day, and there's always questions of why more work wasn't done. The overtime is paid well at 1.5x the normal hourly rate but it is highly unpredictable (even day to day). This makes it nearly impossible to make evening or weekend plans because you never know when you are going to leave. This lack of work/life balance greatly contributes to stress which is so overwhelming it's difficult to put into words. But at least there's insurance and 401k available!"
bad,Didn't have anything to protect the elbows. Management makes people sit in a conference room with nothing to do. Not helpful . No enjoyment working here
bad,"very stressful"
bad,"There is no work/life balance in this company. It always comes down to business needs and that is the bottom line. They do not care how they effect their employees family life, only thing this company cares about is the almighty dollar."
bad,"working there, if you are Not a political game player, you can't survive. You'll be surprised how messy and lousy the internal management is for a big company like this. Manual work, lowtech"
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"Very fast paced and stressful.  No room for growth, unless you are a part of the boys club, which is huge there.  Big appeal to millenials.  Too many chiefs, not enough indians."
bad,I was treated very unfairly I was yelled at for going too fast?!? And Fired for telling my leader that the machine I was supposed to run was overheated it was supposed to be at 295 degrees and it would constantly heat back up to 320 so I complained that I wasn't able to do my job on that machine and was fired for it. This is just an overall horrible place to work everything is very unorganized you stand around and do nothing half the shift and are reprimanded then if you move to fast because there is never more work ready but they make you work every weekend because they say they're behind I wouldn't recommend working here to my worst enemy.
bad,"The culture is based on quarter to quarter results and is very shortsighted on their view of the future.  No leadership at site or division level, very poor processes and controls"
bad,There is an enormous lack of connection between Management and the production floor processes to the extent that efforts to make improvements are so missinterpreted that they are conterproductive to say the least. This creates a hostile work environment where resentment is felt by all.
bad,This isn't a very good company to work for.  I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone seeking employment.  I would not consider reapplying to any position within this company.
bad,"This is straight up the worst place I ever worked. Managers would insult employees right in front of other people which made for a very uncomfortable environment to work in daily. There is small select group of people and if you are not in that group they do not care about you and you will not be there long. I got text messages at home while I was trying to sleep to let me know what time to come in on a daily basis because there is no organization. Got hurt pretty bad because of faulty equipment and dangerous workplace and they refused to give me x-rays and sent me back with an injury and threatened to let me go if I didn't go back. All in all just a terrible place to work, only thing good was money."
bad,"The only thing good about my experience here was the compensation.  "
bad,"I was promised a lead position, then they put me somewhere I was way over qualified for. Worst place ever. Only happy people are upper management."
bad,"High red tapes and politics within the department. High staff turnover. Bad culture, poor leadership and work ethic within the department."
bad,"served as a material handler specialist on contract assignments to many different companies such as Aspen Publishers. Primary responsibilities included inventory control, material transport, material location management, and preparation for shipping."
bad,"The pay is terrible. Everyone gets paid the same no matter what position you are in. They lie about hiring you through the company. The background checks are more difficult than FBI checks. No raise upon hire. Management is horrible. The training is bad, you have to pretty much learn from other people or on your own. I wouldn't recommend anyone looking for a long term career to apply here. People constantly come and go. A very high turn around rate. The receiving supervisor is a mean old lady who abuses her power."
bad,"Tme to move out, after years of politics. Thanks for all the golden years."
bad,No advancement and Senior People walk all over you. No Respect from anyone in the plant.
bad,A good work place for the employee has three elements. One you're happy to go to work. Two you tell your friends and family what a good company it to work for. Three and most important you want said friends and family to work for them. In this capacity ThermoFisher fails horribly. Working for them towards the end I felt clueless on how to work at my job. They said it was to improve and to treat change like an opportunity not a threat. On a typical day you had no idea where you would end up because we were so short handed you could be in three different job functions and be running the whole day. Numbers were the culture not safety and the workers are not thought of at all.
bad,Life Technologies is the combination of Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems. The Invitrogen management and culture were overlaid onto the existing AB business. The new company seems more interested in Marketing than Technology. Most top technologists were RIF'd or left the business. Qualilty of AB products has significantly dropped.
bad,"No respect for customer facing employees. HR part is the worst. Only thing they care about is numbers."
bad,nobody knows what they are doing because there is no structured S.O.P and management does not care if a person knows what they are doing because they just want lackeys.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"The management was awful.  The last manager was hired and I was not part of the hiring team.  We worked at a previous company in the same relationship years earlier.  He was eventually removed from managing people.  His favorite role is hatchet man.  I lasted the expected 1 year after reporting to him again.  "
bad,"Working at Thermo is working in a dead end situation, unless you like to brown nose and are useless.  Opportunity for advancement is not existent, could be a good start company"
bad,Lab work for a large portion of the day then meetings and paperwork the management didn't want to do. Then complete our lab work and do paperwork based on that lab work.
bad,Agency staff treated badly only offered limited training. Management don't really know what happens in the production area if they do they turn a blind eye as long the goods are going out the door. Lots of favouritism between shift supervisor and certain employees as they all came from another local company which recently closed. Experienced agency staff overlooked for permanent contracts and the permanent contracts offered externally.  All in all this place is one to avoid.
bad,All that matters at Thermo seems to be the bottom line. And all decisions are based on money. Like in most places there are good a bad people. The hardest part of the job is to do your job with lack of resources and with job overload due to not having enough Engineers to get the work done right.
bad,"They work to to the bone and are treated badly on second (unsure about 1st). The atmosphere is toxic and you’re never left alone to do your work, you always have a Superviser In your area telling you that you are behind and need to work harder and faster. Way to high volume for what little staff they have."
bad,"Several employees since the time I've been here, less than two years, have left the organization to go to external companies or different divisions due to fact that our organization is always left in the dark, lack of communication, and no general support from leadership or greater Thermo."
bad,"poor management, stressful work place, unsafe work environment, unknown work hours everyday, no work life balance, could care less about your  family or kids, advancements were based on kissing up to bosses instead of knowledge and work ethic, the more work ethic you have the more work you get thrown on you, HR was only there for management bot the employees, management usually stayed closed in the office and made it like they knew nothing about safety issues or workplace concerns and issues when they were taken to the top by employees, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO WORK HERE EVER, ridiculous turn over rate, always short handed on workers everyday, every department in the distribution center frederick"
bad,"ThermoFisher is a good company except this branch (Asheville), Horribly poor Managers enough to destroy your life, the mangers in this branch can mess with everyone and no one can tel them even a word, it is so shameful that when I was working over there I was noticing the Managers were developing unreasonable issues with high qualified engineers, unfortunately the Managers in this branch are group of friends inside and outside of the company so they can come together against one person. "
bad,"I increased revenue from 2.5 million to 5 million and profit from 1.1 million to 2.3 million in less than 3 years and never made over 70K."
bad,Favortism and bad equipment. No regard to customer merchandise with a box a minute. Managers are not open minded. Scans are not reachable due to equipment. Treat temp workers like slaves.
bad,"The AMS program is a ???e. Thermo AMS program cooks the KPI data presented to the customer. The Thermo AMS program will styme you work flow, you will wait longer for service trust me. Thermo has no Multivendor engineers (75000 employees). Customer submits quotes for service contacts received directly from vendor to Thermo AMS Team, the Thermo Commercial Support Team up’s the price and the customers pay, no clue. Pharmceutical companies are the easiest to scam because the are have lots of money to waste, you should hear some the ???p the AMS salesperson tells the costumer. Thermo also terminated all but one tech from the inventory management team in an effort to save money, this is the reasons the inventory is scr£we’d up at nearly every account. Bad inventory data really causes serious complications like missed PM’s and quals in a GXP lab. I have personally seen the happen at a few accounts and it’s not good. On the other hand the managed services group is actually a very good program, the teams I’ve worked with are helpful and will enhance any managed service program. The people on the managed service side are actually awesome, it is the the instrumentation side of the business with lots of internal issue and customer complaints. "
bad,The pay is very good however the management of tasks and responsibilities given to management and myself were\ are unrealistic for the the deadlines set.
bad,"A typical day at work involves a brief morning meeting to come up with a general plan for what products and work orders need to be completed that day, and also to discuss shortcomings of the team and specific individuals. The rest of the day involves completing my assigned tasks, as well as various odd-jobs, which often results in me multitasking (because my department is not staffed adequately), and covering for the negligence of other coworkers who can be very lazy and unmotivated at times. The few things that I learned from my current position include time management, troubleshooting equipment failures, and patience when dealing with difficult or emotional supervisors. The workplace culture is very individualistic, and also very reactive (rather than proactive), meaning that they wait for things to fall apart before they try to solve problems. The most challenging part of my job is that there is no sense of teamwork. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that its in an ideal location (close to home), and there are a few hardworking coworkers who I enjoy collaborating with."
bad,"Thermo Fisher is a results driven organization that does't understand how to actually get results which is through fostering a culture of collaboration and teamwork and by valuing its people. It drives people to the ground by demanding 15 hour work days and work on weekends.  It has shifted to a patriarchal, arrogant, egotistical, ""perception"" is more important than any other indicator of success or even more important than real accomplishments.  It is male dominated, aggressive, and truely horrible within the corporate culture. The companies it acquires seem to have a much more progressive culture and seem like nice places to work."
bad,The pay is better than average but the work life balance is non existent.  The hardest part of my job is finding the time to complete all the tasks without having to work lots of overtime.
bad,"I only worked there 2+ weeks. In those 2 weeks I was shown nothing. I was not certified on the equipment, not given a sign on to WMS. All I did was pull 900lb pallets around with a hand jack. "
bad,Workplace culture was very poor in the area of development of careers and leadership communication.  Work life balance was never considered and leadership only drove to the bottom line with no development of careers.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"I worked for the AQI division. I also worked for other divisions of Thermo Fisher Scientific. I have to say that the different divisions have varying cultures. The top management of the company are not concerned about the welfare of their employees and they do not care about their customers. They are 110% about pleasing their shareholders and it is all they ever talked about during quarterly or annual meetings. Most of the time that culture trickled down to the lowest part of the chain. They hired managers that are less than qualified for the position and have no clue how to run anything. They used to have a very solid product but when they laid off half their customer service reps, half their product support reps, half of everything to cut costs and please their shareholders, there was no support whatsoever and it was frustrating for the customers to have to deal with technical problems that the plant should have been able to easily work out. It was very frustrating spending time soothing customers rather than actually making sales. They also had unrealistic expectations entering new markets without a solid plan. When they laid off so many people, there was too much pressure to do the work of those people. That ended up causing people who remained to work overtime to compensate. The work-life balance was horrible."
bad,"The only way to advance at this company is if you know somebody and are well-liked by management. If you're a hard worker I would advise you to apply to a company which will recognize your talents and treat you fairly."
bad,"Pay and benefits are great, but culture and atmosphere are not. Management is not open or respectful, it is not an inclusive or supportive workplace. Hard work and results are not fairly rewarded."
bad,Fisher Atlanta call center is not a good place to work.Micro-management limited growth long hours low moral. Management is lazy and does not help. Benefits are expensive. Call center environment so you are told what to do and when you can do it. Hard to get time off. Pay starts off good but raise is on 3 to 5 %. Employee's are over worked
bad,"Worse department ever in the company due to the management. I have learnt how scary peers can be and how your manager can be so part of the political playing within the department. No support from the manager (director), turnover very high within the team."
bad,"I had 5 different managers in one year. There was a reorganization each quarter. Don't even think of working there. It was like living in a Seinfeld episode. Horrible, horrible place to work."
bad,This company started off good but unfortunately went downhill after being bought.  The change in management definitely made things much harder.  I would never tecomend this company to anyone.
bad,Awful. No decision making or clear guidance. no structure. i would not recomend this company. big turn over of staff tells you everything
bad,The work schedule and hours were inconsistent. The job description and potential to grow and offer suggestions were not taken into account.
bad,"From the very beginning this company seemed very professional but once you got to work on the production floor all that changed. The pay is very low, benefits are not that great, you don't work a complete 40 hour week unless you do over time, the one and only break is cut short since you have to go through this entire process before you can actually get to the cafeteria I can go on and on. There is a very obvious favoritism but I guess that is everywhere, some employees are just bad mouths, rude, and disrespectful considering the fact ""clients"" are constantly walking around the facility. Besides all that I did in fact meet a few very hard working individuals who during my time there made it a bit better. Over all I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place to work to anyone I know unless they were in a serious situation and there was no other option."
bad,"Responsable grands comptes d'industries chimiques , pharmaceutiques et agro alimentaires et recherche publiques CNRS INSERM HCL"
bad,They are to strict on new employees and long as you work there you will see the true things unfold about the company other than that the people were great employees but the ones that feel like they have authority they try to treat you like you are nothing
bad,"I was told ""occasional overtime as needed"" and ended up being forced to work atleast 6 days per week, with m-f being mandatory 10hrs each and Saturdays mandatory."
bad,"Management has to idea what they're doing, so you'll be looking at 2 hours overtime just about every day, and Saturdays ( Mandatory). The supervisor and manager are new to this line of work and are not open to suggestions. if you have an issue they fall on deaf ears. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy."
bad,"The workplace was terrible and management didn't do nothing to help with problems inside the work place. All the upper management cared about was the money in their pockets and supporting their families, other employees were just a number."
bad,"Too focused on profits and making numbers, there is little investment in the proper infrastructure improvements to allow the facility to keep its commitments. No investment or show of appreciation for their people except for the occasional superficial token. Poor moral, the place is a revolving door for anyone with talent or real abilities. Too many people wear too many hats, there is no backup if someone is out. Not recommended unless you are desperate for a paycheck."
bad,"the job was ok for the time I was there but chance of progression, some people were treated differently so others and the flexibility for a working mum was not great"
bad,"The pay seems very good, until you realize you rarely do what your job title entails. There is soooo  much favoritism and lying to get you in the door, them you see how messed up and completely "
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"Leadership bullies employees. workloads carry the responsibilities of 2+ people. No work/life balance-work evenings,weekend & holidays. High turnover."
bad,Too much overtime and very little personal respect from most of management. Raises are normally disappointing as well with few actual benefits and health insurance rates have gone up which coverage going down.
bad,"This would be a great company to work for but the management is the worst I've ever seen, the supervisors are never around and ignore all the problems the people have. They blame production for not getting work out instead of trying to fix the problems on the floor. Most of the people are nasty especially to new people. Nobody really knows standard work procedures so it is chaos all day everyday. You work mandatory overtime every week and rarely get a weekend off."
bad,"I would say it’s a good job at first but it’s long hours on your feet and they don’t pay you well unless your on the weekend shift which is two twelve hour days and then 2 , 8 hour days."
bad,"thermofisher is a company who is gearing towards global markets, they have been making huge changes inside the company and head people are leaving regularly all the time, no advancement opportunities without getting in good with the department you want to work in, it is also very clickish so if you dont fit it then you are treated poorly, people talk to one another like they are nothing and management either has no say in things or dont care how employees treat one another, no overtime is allowed, under staffed, over worked and dont want to pay"
bad,"Great job interacting with doctors on a daily basis.  Not much to say about management.  Started back when the company was Phadia, a privately held company.  Things changed dramatically when Thermo bought them.  Did not see a successful future in their culture."
bad,"Can not stand it, am looking to get out."
bad,"Hired to complete task of getting units ready for others to work."
bad,managment was poor in fact the manager got fired for doing such a poor job also cut throats there to do anything to move up the latter just pathetic wouldnt recommend anyone to work there PLENTY OF OVERTIME THOUGH
bad,"I never met better people to work with, but the management is horrible and drives all the good employee's out and leave the others with little to no motivation to work there. When people call in sick they get mad at everyone who showed up to work. If you are good at your job and finish what you were supposed to do they compensate you by giving you other people's work. The phones ring every 3 seconds and you have to answer every single call perfectly because if you don't they will grade your call and you will lose your shift time."
bad,My day is very busy with running multiple printers and schedule change is constant.   Management is very nasty and mangers has history of manipulating and yelling.
bad,"Für das dürftige Gehalt wird zuviel gefordert."
bad,"If you want job security, then stay far away from this place. There are so many problems with management, quality, and just an ungrateful attitude towards employees. They work you too hard for minimal pay. This place is a cluster of unorganized people desperately trying to make the company money."
bad,"The management is a joke. They only care about production so it works in their favor. They show favoritism towards certain employees.  "
bad,worked at the grand island location in N.Y. Was terrible in every way possible. Favortism was huge in the department I was in.. It reminded me of High School all over again. Everyone thinks and acts like management but management. I wouldn't work there again even if the company offered me a salary position doing nothing all day. You had no life working there. you had to work every weekend and at least stay two hours after your shift everyday. you never knew when you were going to go home. The money was good but I would rather have my sanity!!!!!!!!
bad,This company was actually the worse company during my 15 year career.
bad,"Plant closed because we were only union plant they operated. the Dubuque plant was a money maker, was a bad decision on Fisher Scientific part."
bad,The campus in Verona road is a old haunted building with signs of no hope. Places dirty all around. The baby boomers filled campus is full of politics and never be flexible for changes. They have great people with surprising attitudes.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"Personnel issues are the problem this job possesses. Bullying is predominantly the norm. One bad apple can ruin the sauce. Due to fear of lawsuits and replacement difficulties, management refuses to act on bullying issues."
bad,"The  management is overworked and put their stress on their employees, and there is not much guidance or will to change. Some of management even seems to push against change because its considered ""too complicated"" in the short run."
bad,"This place on the night shift is very high school. If they like you, you are in. If you aren't willing to kiss up, you are ignored and treated like you don't exist. Day shift seems to be a general better fit to feel apart of the team. Night shift, well half of them will go out of their way to make you feel unwanted."
bad,Not all areas are bad but the area I was in did a horrible job of keeping promises and working with you. They bring in upper authority that either refuse to understand how the process works or too content on doing things their way or even just too simple to under basics.
bad,i was repeatedly ridiculed on work that wasn’t even mine. the supervisors are for the most part good but there are a few that will walk all over you and throw you under the bus in the blink of an eye. the pay is really nice but you have to sacrifice any free time you have to the job. also the second your line meats quota it gets raised again. there is a very hostile work environment do to the constant overflow of  nonsense  flying in 24/7 in thermo fisher. i’m also on the phone currently trying to figure out where my last check has went to and knowone has answers
bad,"The corporate part of the company is very political. The emphasis is more on how it looks than what is accomplished. Goals are set but then changed on a constant basis, even when they are strategic in nature."
bad,"slowly changing for the better"
bad,"If you overproduce yourself and do a great job here and even get praised for it you'll never see any reward. They take, take, take and expect you to bleed yourselves dry for them. The worst and most abusive place I've ever worked. Ethically this place was terrible. They operate ""lean"" so you better believe that means you work harder for less and their management is trained to justify this by any means necessary to devalue you, minimize your concerns about the work environment, etc."
bad,"The Cincinnati branch is Pharmaceutical but its ran like the Automobile industry. Hardest part of the job is Management. They have a saying of Work, Life, Balance but its all Work."
bad,Management changes made it difficult to keep a positive outlook.  Expertise and experience were not appreciated or utilized and many seasoned employees were phased out.
bad,Bad management...other then that I had no problem there. It's a very fast pace. You have to be 100% accurate. Very tedious work. Friendly people I just didnt agree with management
bad,"Working for this company has pro and cons, commission is great if you do mind working in a morgue, its like being back at school. Wages are good but no obvious advance in your career"
bad,"Management only interested in profits and no integrity despite the advertised core values.  Test products until they pass, then ship them.  Cut staff and pile on responsibilities to get them to quit to avoid paying out unemployment when they let you go."
bad,"Planned maintenance, routine maintenance and emergency maintenance."
bad,poor training . uses temps mostly. not a good experience. Nothing good to say about my time there.
bad,Horrible customers and sales reps. They allow the reps to treat you bad and the leads and resources they provide to help you don’t at all they themselves get smart and tell you you should know this already. The warehouses make mistakes and you have to take the heat for it. Customers that call in 9 out of 10 times don’t know what their talking about and expect you to know everything and locate information out of yourarse very stressful and they watch you like a hawk on your lunch and breaks and the pay isn’t worth it.
bad,"What a miserable place to work in general--which is crazy!  I loved so many of my co-workers there, but intensely hated the middle and upper management--not all of them--but most of them.  I don't miss the lies, I don't miss the perfect reviews that resulted in minimal pay increases.  I don't miss the never-being-able-to-please-anyone feelings there.  I don't miss the culture where everyone is so invested in protecting their jobs and saving face that they lie to their customers and employees alike.  "
bad,You wont advance and too many hazardous chemicals. pay not great either... Really no chance moving up there and management is terrible.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"I enjoyed working there despite the daily confusion  of hours. The end times were never the same daily, but i overall enjoyed working there its a very fast pace job which keeps you on your toes all day. QA at thermo fisher was quite eventful, i enjoyed seeing the products they supplied."
bad,I enjoyed THERMO and was there for eight years and was hoping it would be my place till retirement unfortunately I took a raw deal and got terminated for something I'll never understand if I could recommend anything stay quite and do your job cause at least this plant in millersburg pa. Is ran unfairly the management lies to cooperate and they are poor with keeping up on records and being truthful to there customers
bad,"Typical day at work: Lead generation, create new product requirement documents, overhaul the entire sales documents"
bad,I encountered female bullies.New technologies were not pursued and new trends ignored.
bad,"The pay is not comparable to many of its competitors."
bad,"The same management/staff members are allowed to get away with bullying/sexism due to their status ."
bad,"if you work in the warehouse or the boxing room it's a slave camp. Production output has doubled in recent years but not until recently have any extra staff been provided to cope with the increase. There is no proper leadership or organisation and it's like working under the gestapo, the management cannot wait to pull you in the office. Trigger happy. The place is a shambles, it's the worst company i have ever worked for. It used to be an ok place to work but not anymore. Nobody wants to work there and they leave when they get the chance of a different job ."
bad,"Life Technologies was a great place to work until Thermo Fisher acquired it. Life Technologies supported my career path and I was highly successful and was able to contribute greatly to the revenue growth of the organization. Then Thermo bought Life and suddenly was no longer supportive of the group I worked, despite the high profitability of my results and successes."
bad,I was a contractor for specific amount of time and not a regular full-time employee.  I do not know what else to write as it was only a couple month project.
bad,"While working Thermo Fisher Scientific, It always Seemed as if they were spinning their wheels and didn't have  any clear cut direction. Stay away this place is toxic"
bad,The supervisers don't care about you or your family. they are all push overs and expect you to do others jobs too. promise full time postions and then never give to you.
bad,"It is a toxic culture at this place, the work environment is extremely poor, it is a good place to stay away from."
bad,"Engineers are pressured into coming up with unrealistic schedules and then get in trouble if they don't meet the schedules. Products are released with inadequate testing due to no test plans and the engineers are blamed for the resultant bugs. We had stand-up meetings every morning at 9:00, attendance was taken right at 9:00 and you wouldn't get counted if you were more than a few seconds late, and you'd get in trouble for being late too many times.  And the pay is low."
bad,The management team is lacking appreciation of all the hard work all the employees do for the company. They make poor decisions and make last minute changes in their manufacturing plans on the fly that jeopardizes their on time deliveries metrics. Making poor business decision is going to cost this company their customers and their employees
bad,Untrustworthy.  Not concerned with employees at all.  Acquired our company and then broke it down and sold the parts.
bad,L iked to work there great people but again not employye friendly
bad,"I worked at thermo Fisher for almost 11 years. And I have learnt a lot while working here, team work, good H & S pratices. We were given annual refresher training related to the work."
bad,"there work keep me busy thru out the whole day."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"I would only recommend this job to people who already know they like working in manufacturing environments. The job itself wasn't hard, but the pace and the management made it difficult. "
bad,"High turnover rate, temps not treated equally, favoritism towards some employees, management lacks communication. Don't get management mad at you or you'll be given the runaround, there's a freezer section were you'll be in there 3 or more days in a row (-23 degrees)  if the person in charge doesn't like you."
bad,no advancement opportunity. Very high turn over rate. if you know someone you are able to get promotions etc. pay and raises are horrible. I will not recommend anyone to work there
bad,"Working for this company is a good way to get noticed in the corporate world. The benefits are ok but if you want decent pay, work life balance or advancement you should look elsewhere."
bad,"Always low staff and lots of work. "
bad,Long work hours.  The company is undergoing massive change.
bad,Do not recommend this company. There is no opportunity to advance. Decisions are made from upper level management that have never done the work themselves.
bad,"In my time there, I have seen 3 site leads which all failed to keep top managers and supervisors. Quality control is a joke with no pressure to change policy. Many audits, recalls, and investigations went unsolved or not corrected. Inventory concerns frequently shut down or severely slowed down production. Mandatory overtime dug into multiple weekends and holidays, destroying work-life balance. No opportunities for advancement through training or travel or reimbursement for training or certification. Top management and departments seem to have changed month to month so you never knew who you were either reporting to or who you needed to talk to. HR was only helpful to provide you a 1-800 number for outsourced support which could take months to resolve, including payroll which after over 2 years of a payroll inconstancy I am still waiting on resolution. Health insurance policies were a joke, 401K match was the only saving grace if you were enrolled. The only way to advance is to push someone else under the bus or wait until they quit for the same reasons stated above. Stress and outrageous demands have caused serious health related issues with many past and present employees. There is also a serious age gap in the workplace, people with 20+ years are constantly stuck in their old ways of doing things which clash with the young innovative minds of newer employees who burn out or move on for that reason. "
bad,"If your looking to be belittled and looked down on by managment  then this is the place for you too be, you are just a person to fill a much needed spot and they have a very high turn over rate."
bad,At the start fine but found it to be a bullying environment where Management turned a blind eye to problems. Blame culture. Kept being called gay but I’m not.
bad,"Left wanting room to grow . "
bad,"Arrogance, ignorance and nepotism are prevalent here in IDD-US."
bad,"Steer Clear of this site. Management could care less about the workers.  A shut up and do it mentality.  No one cares enough to fix the clear underlying problems. The turn over rate is insane, it goes all the way up the ladder too."
bad,This company is way too political. If you are not a progressive liberal you will be discriminated against by HR. The work is easy though. I am referring to the Factories in Fairport and Penfield. If you are a scientist or an engineer then perhaps it would be a good place to work. The company though has an extreme political slant.
bad,"Typical day consist of working on issues across multiple regions.  There are plenty of ad-hoc work and daily requirements, so managing time and priority is key."
bad,"Absolutely no room for advancement. Mandatory Overtime, with clueless supervisors who follow around the leads like a lost puppy. People are decent, but gossip way to much. PTO is the only positive about this company. The pay is horrible for the work that you do, and raises are very minimal."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"Surprisingly first thing you think about Thermo Fisher is a well known company. This Fremont location has a long way to go. If you're thinking about delivering a quality product, this is not the place as it has a lot of areas where it needs to grow from quality, safety and delivering to our customers. I do not feel like there is support from management to get things done. It all begins with how corporate supports the local site. Poor communication and false promises. This place does not comply to current regulations."
bad,"In my time there I learned how little a corporation can care about its employees. There is very little chance of internal advancement, the pay is ok to start but the raises offered do not keep up with the cost of living increases. Other than that they have no issue shipping jobs oversees, treating their customers like cash cows and ignoring any kind of work life balance."
bad,"Unfortunately, there was a nuclear radiation leak on site and was not disclosed to employees in a timely manner by upper management.."
bad,Working in a fast paced freezer invironment 12-14 hours a day.Little or no training with high turnover rate.
bad,"If you are just getting out of high school and you want a temporary place to work until college, this is the place for you. That is, a temporary job. The annual raises suck, the bonuses suck. There are way too many higher-ups compared to workers. (too many chiefs). Don't ever go out of your way to help out the company because the favor will NEVER be returned. I started here 7 years ago and this company was very different. Moral of employees is very low. I could go on and on. Don't work here"
bad,To big of a company to care about employees. Benefits are some of the worst yet. Management is lacking if not just horrible. They care more about the bottom line than they do their employees.
bad,"We were bought out by Thermo and they've taken away nearly 2 weeks of time off through sick days, emergency time off, and employee designated floating holidays. We are also underpaid on average for the same work in the area in different companies. Lots of immaturity and backstabbing amongst management, no one looking to fix problems but instead pointing blame. Building is falling apart and only gets cosmetic fixes for audits. Long hours and no disregard for home life, only cares about getting work out."
bad,Worked there 17+ years and you could get internal promotions 10+ years ago. Now all new positions filled with outside personnel excluding management. Crazy work loads and raises have been at a 2.5% MAX for over 10 years.
bad,Good company to gain having on resume and move on from there. Micromanaged and toxic work environment.  Job title is just that.  Management does not allow you to make decisions and control everything you do.  If you speak up you get shut down.  I could go on but would say move on to something better.
bad,"Production and sales driven company. Important products made  and booming business. Since purchased by TFS a few years ago, we outgrew the building very quickly.  Sales demands continue to grow every quarter with not enough people or space.  Overtime is a year round way of life.  Saturdays are required between one and three times a month.  Optional additional OT is there for those who want or need it.  Production Supervisors stay in offices and meetings."
bad,"I worked at this site for almost 5 years. It wasn’t a bad job or bad place to work during the first year, but after becoming ThermoFisher everything went downhill, and got worse each year. You work 9-10 hours a  day and 4-8 hours on Saturday. The pay should be much higher considering what you’re doing. Supervisors are hardly ever on the production floor. The amount of work to be done keeps going up every quarter, every year, yet the proposed facility expansion hasn’t started yet. A weekend shift was added, yet you still work overtime almost every Saturday. They have job fairs about every 2 weeks, because the turnover rate is outrageous. There isn’t enough space, tools, or equipment to produce the quantities that are asked for. Management is horrible, yelling at employees and not doing their jobs and fixing the problem. A lot of good, very experienced people have left due to too much overtime and being frustrated and stressed."
bad,wil er zo snel mogelijk weg. management en communicatie is slecht. maar de collega's zijn een enorm plus punt.
bad,managed multiple projects at the same time. Obtained experience in running onsite hiring events.Being able to work from home was the most enjoyable part of the job.
bad,Work / Life balance is not something that is part of this position.  This is not a company that listens to its field supervisors.  The problem is the people in the middle.
bad,If your looking for a place to grow it's not the place to be there stuck in time and none ethical. The culture is very toxic to be a work environment and the moral is very down...
bad,"The CSR department manager is a woman who speaks about her intimate life during progress meetings or mentions inapropiate remarks about employees. "
bad,"When I started there, we had a contamination problem.  2 years later when I left they still had a contamination problem. They couldn’t figure it out. Management blamed the workers but it was probably the fact that the so called clean room was not clean and too hot.  We were also supposed to get Friday off but spent most of them working due to the amount of back orders we had.  Overall the job was not difficult to learn just very repetitive."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"Supervisors not being understanding and being rude in communication. Also, demeaning when questions are asked. Love the gym, the cafeteria but all that are trivial."
bad,very poor processess and no long time goal. The decision making process is based on quarterly results. Good for a short time. Poor management and low moral overall.
bad,You won't move up. you will be stuck doing the same thing everyday. Good for a short time but not as a career. Management isn't great. Pay increases are about .12-.20 cents
bad,The company is a good company to work for in their research or production. They do not treat their manufacturing employees with respect and are not very organized. The fact the environment is mixed with educated and non-educated employees it makes it the working environment a bit awkward.
bad,"Very fragmented corporation, with very different work experiences depending on which division / location you work at. My division had a very fragmented management structure, where functional areas were against one another and very territorial. Work life balance was poor and management expected you to work all week and even weekends because of their poor management styles."
bad,"Flexibale working time, nice GYM facilitys with shower."
bad,Need a change of company. Started nice but no room to advance. You have to be friends with managment to advance. Hard work and dedication is just not enough!
bad,"I invested many years at this company, and in the end, I had no job security.  They had and continue to have RIF on a regular basis.  There is no respect or concern for the individual worker."
bad,"Too much drama, like kindergarten. The people holding positions like cell leader and supervisor should be re evaluated. Some should not be in the positions they are in. Too many hours, too low pay."
bad,"Typical day is cleaning up someone else's problems, whether it is defective parts from manufacturing or finishing jobs started by inexperienced field service technicians. Sales people constantly cut corners to make a sale by removing options from instruments to lower costs and that missing component makes other components useless and really is a disservice to the customer. You can bring up issues and problems and be labeled a problem maker and then 6 months later they want you to join a team to address the problems you originally brought up. Management is extremely poor and inexperienced and it shows everyday in every way. No one is concerned with fixing problems properly and the only reason Thermo stays in business is because they are as large as they are and strong competitor should have no problem taking business from them. My career was definitely better before Thermo took my original company over."
bad,Un bon turnover permet d’intégrer régulièrement de nouveaux collègues. Ceux-ci sont souvent sur leur premières expériences professionnelles aux vu des bas salaires proposés. Les possibilité d'évolutions de post et de salaires restent malgré tout assez faibles. Pour faire ses armes ... c'est une très bonne école. Mais il ne faut pas dépasser 4 ans !
bad,"People are great, management unfortunately lacks focus. I learned many things about the budgeting process and annual operating plans as well as some key management skills."
bad,"This is for the Life Tech in Frederick, Maryland. There, with their management, you're expected to work the full 10 hour day and if people called out that day then you're also expected to work even longer to make up for them. During the winter if you showed up and your other co-workers didn't, you were usually made to stay even 12 to thirteen hours, or even overnight. Sure, the extra money was great, but at the end of the week you're so exhausted from constantly running around doing orders for people that you have no energy to do things on the weekend. But you have to, because any normal person has errands. The management there was awful, with a few exceptions. However, the co-workers were great, amazing people. I got so close to so many people who would drop everything to help me out. It was unfortunate, though, KNOWING they were going to leave soon since it was only a temp job. Overall, working at Life Tech led me to meet great people, but also taught me that there jobs out there that can just make you miserable. No room for advancement unless you're the top manager's best friend, no benefits, no time to do anything outside of work, and awful management. I'm so glad I don't work there anymore."
bad,This is a good company to work at if you are a full time employee. Temp help is hard work & are treated as non-people.
bad,"The Millersburg, PA location has decent pay and benefits but basically no break or lunch."
bad,"I have been working there for 19 years"
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,Intentional harassment by employer and co-workers. No action taken by this employer. Bad saftey of employees by saftey management. Poor Human Resources. Not enough parking. Work overload in all areas. Majority of workers are unhappy.
bad,Management was unorganized and unprofessional.  HR department was horrible. Didn’t receive my first paycheck until a month after my first day. Based off of my experience I should’ve been a leader but was treated as a entry level-recent high school grad.
bad,"Fairport, NY Thermo Fisher works completely different than any other Thermo Fisher I've worked for. For starters, they are very disorganized. I worked for a different Thermo Fisher in a different state before this, so I transferred in. I was not told of any orientation until I had missed it. My badge took 4 weeks to work properly. "
bad,Old Management they lie..the place will never change with the management they have now turnover rate for employees is out of this world..they use recruitment for hiring process that's no good at all..
bad,"it is a good company, but management does not care about the employees. Management does not do any work and does not work with the employee to make them better."
bad,"This was a Great place to work before thermo took over then our budget went down and the work load increased due to very bad management , We use to be able to make suggestions but now dont get caught saying anything no matter how much experience you have  they dont want to hear it !"
bad,"The job was pretty easy, but your productivity wasn't calculated the best way. Your productivity was rated by how many line items you scan, pick, and pack. This would then calculate an average number per hour. However, if there were no items to pick, you couldn't maintain that number causing your average to drop. If this happened too often, you'd be let go. Employees also worked around which items to pull since some could be done in a minute or two while others may take a few minutes longer. This would cause others to get stuck with the more time consuming items. All this was brought to management, but they didn't seem to care that much. There seemed to be some favoritism as well since some employees received a lot of slack on their work performance."
bad,Change in management made company not a best place to work anymore. external and internal pressure. Low salary and no promotions ( they'd rather hire external candidate)
bad,"Way too many VP's.  Very top heavy. You are treated by your title and upper management is not very friendly. The culture is fairly cut throat and you are judged negatively when mistakes happen, yet there is no recognition for the positives.  If you want to work with nice people, fair and truly interested in you personally, this is not the place."
bad,They are not Fair at the Frederick Site. They do not recognize you for your hard work. Some of the mangers are not equip nor train to carry out leadership positions.
bad,"This place is very much run as a ""do what your told and don't ask questions"" kind of operation. Employees' opinions are dismissed. Managers are allowed to treat subordinates very poorly, even verbally abuse them without consequences from local HR or from corporate HR in California. This facility is in a very rural area where good paying jobs are scarce, so overworked and demeaned employees are often forced to endure the toxic environment. It is a mysoginistic, arrogant, and apathetic group that has control over the site. Corporate HR has been made aware of the situation by multiple employees, and have come to visit the site with other top corporate personnel, but they never change anything. They seemingly just go back to California and forget about it. If you don't mind working in a place that will force you to work overtime (illegal in PA), demean you and your work constantly, ignore your suggestions for improvements, and make you dread every day in that place, then this could be a great place for you."
bad,Fast paced and high pressure job.  Little to no training had to learn on your own.  Poor communication by the supervisor.  Favoritism is rampant at Fisher
bad,Culture was not wok-life balance.Workloads were extreme and didn't support life challenges when needed. Difficult to build staff and teams to achieve ever increasing goals.
bad,"using ancient computer system. no support from HR and upper management. everything is about #s #s #s. unrealistic expectations. underpaid, over worked without over time pay. Hires retards for pennies that can't do simple tasks."
bad,"Mandatory 10 hour days, M-F, few but some mandatory Saturday's, depending on order volume. Distribution management is very good but many promises go unfulfilled due to unresponsive upper management. Order processing production line equipment that constantly needed baby-sitting for work flow to proceed and was never remedied, though promised. Preached team approach but temps were clearly not part of the clique."
bad,"Some groups work ridiculously long hours. Don't know who to call to help with what. Weak onboarding, not very helpful. Manager support is minimal. Just make your numbers, no one cares how or will help you in any way get better at it. Nice people to work with for the most part. Heavily matrixed, too many groups doing their own thing. Sometimes your customer will have a bad opinion of the company because of some other group they've worked with you don't now about, and it makes it hard for you to sell."
bad,"It's hard work and if you are willing to work hard than go for it. every shift does things a little different and at times that makes for a huge mess when you pick up a job from another shift. "
bad,"management does not stand behind there Team Leads."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,The first thing I noticed when I started at ThermoFisher is the company felt like a start-up not a fortune 500 company.  The management was always in transition in a lot of departments and the BOM integrity of most builds were not accurate and altered in production without correcting the BOM.  This made inventory accuracy a mess and costing inaccurate.
bad,The company limits you regarding your advancement opportunities and the management creates a harsh environment. Instead you are asked to work more and can work from home some days but it does not create a good work/life balance.
bad,"No future here, constant management turnover, poor training, people are expected to work with out properly being trained. Long time employees fired on a whim. Managers fired or transferred monthly"
bad,"The company overall offers great benefits and is a good company. However, due to the size of the company they are unaware or un-interested in the employees or work environment. Policies and procedures are rolled out with minimal guidance and expectations are set that are impossible to meet. The management does not take any interest in improving employee morale."
bad,"Pros: Job is easy although sometimes work gets loaded"
bad,"Had an interesting time at Loughborough site Global Chemicals, tendency to be production biased as opposed to safety, Not necessarily their fault, very little understanding of business resilience or COMAH regulations compliance. Typically a US remote site with no real clue on safety or environmental matters - gross negligence."
bad,"typical day is being told what to do by project leader and not my boss."
bad,"I did not get fired (quit with notice) so this is not one of those hatefull reviews. Working at Thermo for the past five years I have seen the company go from what I thought was bad to worse. Working here will literally change your life for the worse. Way too many hours (if you like extreme OT please apply) for anyone to have a life or manage school, children or anything else. Management does not communicate effectively and lots of the whole ""ball is in your court now"" mentality. Co-workers were great, those that have been there a while, but really bad turnover with new associates. In my brief time there I had a new GOM, OM and Supervisior every year! Raises were a joke.... twenty or thirty cents a year. They say your raise is really the gain share program the company provides. But the program has so many factors that are out of your personal control (training from management, errors, unattainable goals from being short staffed) it is not awlays awarded. Basically, I would say stay away and find anything better."
bad,"It seems TMO only reliable way to improve bottom line results is to move jobs out of the US to low cost countries, plant after plant has moved off shore. Creativity is what the leadership lacks, though if you can get into those ranks you will be paid well. first step in cost cutting is layoffs. Never been around leaders with such short term methods of managing a company, which explains why Thermo is always on the edge of collapsing.Nothing is planned past the immediate quarter."
bad,i would never work there again dont be a min late it seem like the men manger has a problem with women you never no where your getting off will work you like a dog if they can
bad,"On the surface, they can be a great company. HR is friendly and helpful, wages aren't bad, and certain of the managers and workers can be great and fun people! However, there are certain things to note about a few very specific individuals and over much of the observable company as a whole:"
bad,"Amerikanische Philosophie, heisst schönes Bild aber Realität ist Drück und Produktivität und Kosten ohne auf die Leute zu achten"
bad,"I ran a remote warehouse for the Microbiology division located in Kansas. The warehouse was in Muskego, Wisconsin and I can honestly say it was difficult working there. Very little support from corporate and ridiculous work scheduling. Most of the shipping was expected to go out on Mondays, instead of even loading the work week. The sales group was constantly pushing orders past the ship deadline. The computer system occasionally crashed, usually at the busiest time of the day and computer support in Kansas often had trouble solving the problem. By the way my warehouse was the most productive and accurate of the five warehouses in the division."
bad,Company works good with customers. Corporate great to work with and help. Corporate knows Asheville has issues but does not improve. Leadership turns over quickly sometimes fires others just leave.
bad,Very stressful days trying to fight fires instead of taking proactive approach.  They do not hire the support that they need to complete functions.  They are very unequal in their recognition/ awards for supporting teams.  PMO sees all benefits.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"Lack of training. Little work life balance. People are nice. Procedures are lacking. Take a hard pass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,Too many bosses not enough workers. It took them 3 years to get my promotion through after they promised it to me. Management is severely under qualified. They have management training for them but they never follow up. Some horrendous managers there.
bad,"Unless you’re about to retire, live with your parents, or spouse, this is NOT the place for you. Great hours if you’re on an eight hour shift. They only give ONE (10-15 cent) raises per year. Turn over rate is super high and the main ones that are quitting are the ones who have been there for years. Management stick with each other and the employees opinions don’t really matter."
bad,It didn't take long before the first red flag. Poor management communication with the workers. Last minute notifications of anything going on if there was communication. When I was hired I was told the schedule would be from 6am to 2:30p no weekends. It ended up being 5am-3:30 and weekends were a up in the air. Management is rude. The few good people they had/have left or are leaving. Constantly running low on parts needed for the job and then they grip at the workers because of their poor management. If you dont meat their goal they threaten to make you work weekends. I could go on..
bad,You have to know someone in upper management in order to advance. The management changes have driven 20% of the workforce to leave in the last 6 months. They don't care to find the root cause nor do they try and change it. Used to be a great place 8 years ago. They make horrible decisions all based on political things. They are so understaffed but expect employees to cover the gaps. Recruiters are the worst!
bad,"poor management, in too big of a rush, no concern for the employees, poor HR.They hire people who are not qualified to manage or to process pharma drugs"
bad,"If you delivered on a project, they keep upping the amount you have to bring in next time.  No reason why, they just keep raising the bar so you have to quit when you bring in a big deal."
bad,"No management, low pay, never know what work hours are they change everyday. No training.  To many bosses or people who think they are."
bad,"I didn't like the Machiavellian atmosphere at this company at all but it was a good learning experience for me. On a positive note, they're very quality conscious here. There are a lot of meetings about quality and production tracking. I also believe in retrospect that there is a personality type they like to hire there, as we all had to take a Meyers-Briggs kind of test. Your experience here would depend on what department you worked in, as some employees here seemed very content. If you're around the top brass, you're going to really have to prove your meddle here or perish. If you were in production, you really had little margin for error and they dealt with anyone deviating from procedure very harshly. Depending on the severity of a mistake, you could be writing your ticket out of the door on the first offense. Often it was not the person, but the quality of the training they received to do their jobs that was at fault."
bad,"Kommunikation gleich null. Bevorteilung einzelner Gruppen, wenn es um Gehaltserhöhung oder Karriere geht. Frauenquote wird so hochgehalten, dass ein Mann nach Gleichberechtigung fragen muss."
bad,I can only speak to my department (HR). There is absolutely no room for advancement in HR unless you want to leave Pittsburgh. Salaries are very low compared to companies of other sizes and merit increase percentages are one to two percent.
bad,lot of favoritism with multiple family members working in same departments and very unprofessional atmosphere not everyone held to same standards depending on who you knew outside of the workplace.
bad,"This is a fantastic place to work if you love:"
bad,Poor management with no direction and little to no training.  I would not recommend anyone to work at Thermofisher.  Their hiring process took 5 months!
bad,Stressful and toxic work environment.  Culture is bad and I would advise everyone to stay away from this place.  Management doesn't address employee concerns.
bad,Managment is poor the job is easy but raises are not there and managment dosnt listen. The horeing provess is the longest i have ever delt with. Would not recomend
bad,"In my current department, I feel it is a silo culture.  It feels like the veterans are monsters.  Too many vicious cycles, nothing gets fixed. Need more positive, consistent employees."
bad,"Although it is a very large company; the Penfield NY plant was ran like a mom and pop shop. Management cared only about self advancement and very rarely interacted with employees. Career advancement only came to those in the inner circle. Management cared very little about the safety and culture of the work environment. By now there may be different management in place, but a lot of work required to change the culture around to be fair and productive."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,Lack of knowledge and communication make the days very stressful.  The hourly pay is less then the going rate for the area.  Turn over rate is high.  Company gives no forgiveness for honest mistakes.  One mistake and you will be fired. Attendance policy is very strict.
bad,"Overall, Thermo Fisher is a good company with great pay and benefits, however the job culture at it's Memphis location (PSI) severely lacks diversity.It is a melting pot of silos and clicks, promotions and pay increases are based upon ""who you know"" as opposed to how well you perform."
bad,"Very high pressure and high stress environment.  Award winning site slowly being closed, as a result many very talented hard working people lost their jobs.  More science jobs sent overseas."
bad,Good Company but bad manager. Company paid OK but the manager are too stupid thus created a lot of stress to the bottom feeder employee.I work there over six years and i see a lot manager in and out but they to find only the stupid one and a very time they came always try to improve on there 5s but nothing can be done .
bad,Worked for a small piece of of TFS this piece had issues. The overall business is stuck in their ways. The products and facilities need a serious refresh
bad,"I went into the interview not knowing this was a call center. I didn't find out until my first day that it was a very busy call center. You are chained to your desk by your phone. Every single bathroom break takes away from your 2 15 minute breaks. The phones are ringing constantly; once your done with one call you are force fed another and will get in trouble if you take too long in between calls, even just 30 seconds will get you in trouble. They screen your phone calls so you have to be perfect for every single call, almost 60 calls back to back every single day. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"Stay on phone in seat entire day except 30 minute lunch phones monitored to make sure you answer phone as exactly as they   teach you. You do 6 weeks of extensive training including scientific training.I love biology so the job was very interesting but no chance to advance to any type financial jobs unless you go out of town.And would not hire you for sales unless degree in biology. And there you were just a seat occupied not person. We placed orders for many areas in the United States, City, Government,School system,Colleges, Police, Fireman,Military, Scientist, Doctors and etc.Helped them pick what they need are may need. We managed there account and made sure deliveries were made and etc."
bad,"The  culture of Thermo Fisher differs from department to department, so this only pertains to the department I worked within. My department hires people early in their careers and doesn't do much for them other than give them a job. The job provides extremely little training from inexperienced workers, is run by tone deaf management who literally avoid eye contact with people working below them, and demands intense physical commitment (working 10 hour shifts on your feet moving nearly constantly) while offering very little in return. Coworkers can often be great, however, and can help you through the job if you choose to work there."
bad,"The organization of management is not functional. They hire unqualified people that are unable to train their employees. There is no support, guidance or training available for employees. They do not pay employees a competitive rate and have outrageous expectations."
bad,"Interesting technology with many talented people working there. However project schedules are very tight and project resources make it difficult."
bad,"I began working for a company that was purchased by Thermo Fisher Scientific.  The integration was completely bungled.  Thermo Fisher remains a paternalistic style company.  Silos abound.  Furthermore, managers are assigned/hired to manage teams and divisions, etc,  that they know nothing about. For example, business and administrative skilled people were managing scientists, technology despite the managers lack of any understanding of the needs of scientists, laboratory work, technology, etc."
bad,Work/Life balance is poor and working ours are very long. No training is provided and it is left to the employee to do their job.
bad,picking and  packing product to be shipped some days shorter than others depending on work load 
bad,Life technologies only sports the upward mobility of a select pretty group of individuals. Increased responsibilities without promotion oor increased compensation. Little support of professional development frequent spending freezes.
bad,Company did not reflect what was discussed when interviewing.
bad,"Hours are extremely unsociable, you receive a small compensation for back and night shift, but isn't a lot. Certainly doesn't justify the hours."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,Management was poor and unorganized. I enjoyed the work environment but the management was very unorganized. The work was easy overall. I enjoyed working at night.
bad,"Poor direction "
bad,"This site in San Jose makes a very complicated scientific research instrument sold within very limited and unstable academic and research markets. Nobody at this site knows exactly how the instrument works that leads to constant confusion about what is not working and how it should be fixed. All folks who developed the technical foundation for the instrument left the company a long time ago, and their places were filled with random people who are just trying to hold to their jobs without a clear understanding what they are doing. The corporate headquarters and the upper corporate management are mostly experienced in producing and selling generic lab equipment and are trying to push procedures and processes which do not fit this particular site. The supply chain is continuously being changed that leads to significant quality issues. The building itself is old with only a few offices (mostly without windows), so most employees including directors sit in gloomy cubicles."
bad,"No trainings, people are not important only production targets are importent. All the time preasure that you should better but if you want learn is no opportunity for that. Poor pay raise every year."
bad,Long hours. Mandatory Saturday's. No career advancements. Poor supervisor communication. Miserable employees. Floating holidays that the company sets in place for you.
bad,It's a typical manufacturing company that has its issues and does not really care about their employees. The only positive about the job was being allowed to work four days a week instead of the regular five-day routine.
bad,"Many team members are very hard working and many go above what is expected, however management has no appreciation and does not deserve the team that they have!"
bad,"High Stress Environment"
bad,"Rotates Senior Leadership every (max) 2 years and changes direction, NOTHING ever gets completed resulting in significant market share losses and loss of talent. Company is a corporation build on acquisitions, nothing else."
bad,"The former Neslab Instruments was bought by Thermo Fisher, formerly Thermo Electron, who at the time was owned by Life Sciences International, a British company"
bad,"we were small team in CA, the upper management did not seems care us too much. Lack of good communication/feedback from management. Lack of vision/direction."
bad,I am stressed out from just trying to keep up with their rating demands.   For $12.00 to $13.00 per hr. it's just not worth this kind of stress.  They claim to care about you but really don't
bad,11 years with company - let go due to regional resource balancing- non performance related. Denied 3.5 weeks of accrued vacation. Severance package was only 4 weeks (industry standard 1-2 weeks per year of service).
bad,This company is continually evolving to respond to current trends.  There was significant change during my time there and I had 5 different managers in a 2 year period.  We were continually asked to do more with less to compensate for the changes.
bad,Poor management fueled by rumors and gossip.  Like working for a high school clique.  Promotions based on who you butter up rather than your actual performance.  Very negative environment.
bad,"Thermo Fisher as a whole, is a great company worldwide.  However, each site is independent.  There are various sites that are amazing, and set the bar high for excellence.  On the other side, there are sites that are struggling with various challenges.  The Fremont site is a brand new building and has been designated as a Center of Excellence.  That is not true at all.  Even though the site has made efforts to change their leadership, the Fremont is a site is challenged by deeply rooted gaps in several areas within the operation.  The Fremont site has grown tremendously over the last decade and while the business demand has grown, the operation and technology has not kept up with the industry.  It's challenging to work here as the culture is not proactive, everything is a fire drill at the last minute.  Poor planning."
bad,"Nothing new , Since it's an life science company .  Trying it  be an software company with not solid  road map and scope depends on projects.  completely  relay on AWS  cloud."
bad,"When you work at Thermo Fisher for as long as I did, a month over my 90 days and kept getting positive feedback, the highest scores on customer surveys and then be let go without any warning is wrong. I put my all in that company. It isn't right. And supervisors in the customer service department are not qualified nor are they very nice to anyone there. They talk down to people in that department. The regular associates in the department are very nice, but there are some real issues with the training there."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,A typical night a work is quiet employees half fast the job and rushing and didn't fill orders properly. Management was great very helpful and motivated to get things done fast and accurate. Hardest part of job was filling all the orders in 12 hour with only 10 employees.
bad,"Je n'ai pas eu beaucoup le temps de me faire une opinion sur cette entreprise. L'accueil des nouveaux arrivants est assez bon, mais la prise en charge par les collègues du service litige ne m'a pas permis de trouver ma place au sein de cette structure."
bad,"They are making slow progress towards the modern world, but can it happen fast enough?. Employee moral is very low, products need refreshing. ."
bad,"Some of the supervisors are great but overall, you are over worked and underpaid.  The whole crew seems sad or angry most of the time."
bad,"The Security Company - SOS leaves a lot to be desired.  They have virtually NO BACK-UP; so when a guard is out for any reason, they have to scramble to fill the open slot.  They have NO FLOATERS; so they are forced to pull guards from other sites, or have the existing guards work double shifts"
bad,Fun people to work around. Pay increase is nothing. Hard to move up in the company but for a job its ok. I had alot of fun with the people there.
bad,"Life Technologies now owned by Thermo Fisher is a very large corporation with very large management problems."
bad,"punch in work 8hours punch out go home. I learned almost all warehouse duties .My  coworkers were fine  . The hardest part of my job was all the lifting  ,the most enjoyable part was doing my job."
bad,"While the products that come out of this site are beneficial to research and clinical development (which of course makes one feel good about the actual work they are doing); the work culture here is rather deflating to one's sense of self and pride in work."
bad,"What I did not like about working at Thermo is that I had 4 official bosses simultaneously.  All demanding different this at once. "
bad,Sugar Land business unit had lost its interest to R&D. As a result there is no much room to express myself as a scientist.
bad,"Wasnt allowed to leave your ""cell area"" unless you got permission. other personnel seemed to be allowed to surf the web while others worked. no teamwork in ceratin areas"
bad,Company executives lack domain expertise and rely on silo based departments reporting up separately and often to separate EVP's.
bad,"Thermo-Fisher Scientific supports a great product and a great industry. Unfortunately it pays poorly, they pay below market value across the board. The opportunities for advancement are few and most great talent walks out the door once they realize that advancement opportunities are limited. Corporate rules also limit a maximum of 10% pay increases even for advancement to higher positions. Not an employer that rewards experience or performance. It's a great place to get experience and add a good step to your resume. Not a long-term career option."
bad,Once a great company to work for changed by budget cuts that eventually impacted every employee. Made a lay off feel like a breath of fresh air...
bad,The potential for this company is great. Not every department in every location is the same.
bad,"Very poor managers in coporate. The departments never work in unison and the managers spend more time blaming employees for everything than to figure out solutions and how to get things to flow smoothly. The management issues are present in the executive management and shine through all the way to low level managers. Health benefits are great, pay is industry average, but overall morale is terrible."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,For someone with contract and want to apply for a permanent position don't stand the chance to be part of the company and enjoy for their benefits after 6 months or a year with them as a contractor.
bad,management constantly expected overtime and didn't care about the people. Very high turnover rate due to the 12 hour shifts and rotating schedule. The pay is good but you have to sacrifice your life to make a living.
bad,Péssimo RH e gerencia/diretoria são muito fracos para dirigir seus funcionários.
bad,Turn like that they waited so last minute to tell you you were working overtime that day. They would wait till Friday to tell you that you are working Saturday
bad,"There is aways a crisis which trumps personal development or process improvement. Each year goals become more difficult, and the solution becomes work harder not smarter."
bad,They tell you that you will earn three weeks vacation per year but don't tell you that your sick time is included.  SO when you are sick there is no option in the system to put sick time off.  It all looks like you took PTO hours.
bad,The work at thermos fisher scientific was fun and very productive but management made it unbearable and hard to come to work everyday...training was non existent and I personally would ike to see management re evaluated
bad,A great deal of politics and and back stabbing.  Not a healthy work environment when everyone is looking to watch their back.  The old timers believe they rule and the new talent is lost
bad,Thermo has been mismanaged in our division with frequent restructuring. This has created huge disconnects resulting in disfunction business function to business function. Sending jobs to central america & India. Very dissatisfied with this division. Looking for new employment.
bad,"Work long hrs, lots of mandatory over time and weekends, bullied by upper management of sight, no organization, don't take workers ideas into consideration, unfair job advancement,"
bad,"As any place, the people on the front lines are awesome..I left after working nearly 58 hours a week for over a year. Will take from you everything you can give and no controls or encouragement to balance your life and work. As with most management, unable or willing to listen and answer employee concerns, comments and suggestions. If you are not at a specific level of management your words are just letters to upper management. Burned me out in four years."
bad,Always short on headcount makes everyone's job more difficult. you cant live off the pay here. I have learned less than expected from a big name company like this in the 7 years I have been here.
bad,"It is a large company. I don't think that this is a good place for new hiring and junior employees.  I saw many people layoffs and leave."
bad,"The company is a good company, my particular work experience has not been good. Lack of training, advancement, management. Good working hours and benefits."
bad,"Which essentially means that marketing is not critical to their success.  Working within the ecommerce team was frustrating because ecommerce is less than 1% of their revenue, and/yet the technology departments that managed the multiple warehouses and customer data were highly unhappy with the ecommerce sales model that was being implemented.  "
bad,"The work environment is chaotic because there is a very weak and ineffective management team including the value stream leaders and the shift supervisors. The hourly employees are left to fend for themselves. There is an ""old boys network"" that is very difficult to contend with. I learned how not to run a manufacturing operation at the Penfield plant."
bad,The culture is not conducive to growth or team work.  There is not a lot of management support for changing the environment to support success as a team.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"This company is lacking training skills, management skills, and knowledge of how to run a business. Unless you are willing to become a brown noser the opportunity to grow is not available.Lots of favoritism and they hold who they want accountable. If you like to work several hours a week with no appreciation and a ten cent raise at the end of the year then this is the place for you."
bad,"I had a contract assignment with a company Thermo had acquired.  Of course they wanted me to start immediately but upon arrival I had no desk, computer, or logins.  Due to them being acquired we had 2 ERPs, it took 2 weeks to get access to one.  It took 2 months to get access to the other ERP and the shared drive.  All the while my supervisor had to log me in to the ERP every time it timed out and at the end of the day I had to save my work to a thumb drive so my supervisor could download it on the shared drive.  Speaking of my supervisor, she was one of those very-good-at-job-but-have-no-management-skills people."
bad,The day to day is pretty regular. It is easy enough to come in and get your work done and go home. It is very difficult to advance and often harder to find out the status of a position you are seeking out. There is a huge disconnect between Upper Management and the work force that drives a low morale. Compensation tends to lag similar jobs elsewhere by 50%.
bad,They want to be one of the most admired places to work? Riiiiight. Management needs to learn how to listen to and value the people that actually do the work. PhDs and scientists do not equal project managers.
bad,"All training was accomplished with no written procedures."
bad,Interesting place to work.  Dynamics geared towards physician selling.
bad,"Not the greatest culture. Management often disconnected with what's happening on the floor. Wasted money on frivolous items and then complained about budgets, resulting in increased work hours and people doing tasks not in their job descriptions resulting in injuries. People scared to report issues and safety concerns for fear of getting in trouble"
bad,I would not recommend working for Thermo Fisher Scientific to anyone I consider a friend. There are better places to invest your time and effort and my advice is pursue all other possibilities first.
bad,A typical day at work : Busy
bad,"typical day at work -Selling service contracts to the customers and not having a good knowledge of what the instrument does in terms its purpose,i have learned that you don't have to have knowledge only about what you will be selling to the customer but to prepare your self for questions you will be receiving when doing sales."
bad,Was a very busy fast pace place to work for. I really enjoyed it. Lots of overtime and just overall a great place to work for. Lots of great employees
bad,"I worked at the Cincinnati site for several years . During my time with this company I witnessed 3 different PDS directors. The new leader tore up existing department structure and created a culture that stifled collaboration and personal accountability. The top down management philosophy which new directors and lab manager promoted, brought about an environment in the PDS department that lack empathy for employees and succeeded in demotivating employees. "
bad,start of shift check out fork lift for damages pull orders using correct lot numbers stage for packaging I learned how to use a hand held computer  The management was good but kept promising things they could not due in a timely manner the hardest part was just learning where everything was at
bad,"Rather than focus on developing those who have experience in the facility and would like to advance, the company prefers to hire from the outside. Even though benefits are good, people are looking for advancement."
bad,Compensation was below average. Management gives impression that we are expendable. Culture is decent. I have learned a lot. They have paid for a lot of my education.
bad,"Thermo Fisher offers good benefits to its employees and also a decent pay. The problem is the management at the location I worked at didn't have much respect for our off time, keeping us some nights hours after our shifts had ended"
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,The Thermo Fisher Cincinnati site has been poorly managed for many years and there has always been a large turnover of management and production workers at the site.  Although communications between upper management and production workers is good.  Communication between middle management and production workers is very poor and employee moral suffers.
bad,"I enjoy working with other employees. The hardest time of the year is  with Month and Quarter end. We work many hours throughout the week. I process orders, bids, quotes, returns. There is not a lot of compensation within the company or growth opportunities."
bad,"While working with Thermo Fisher; I had the ability to meet many new people.  The majority of the clientele was amazing.  However, the atmosphere and management was complained about often by many employees."
bad,"TF has a tendency to acquire a company for 1 product, and dump/lay off staff for the rest. When TF acquired my company, they were not very private or sensitive about the immediate layoffs. Although I was not laid-off, it showed me that sticking around wouldnt be very secure."
bad,I enjoyed working for this company but have had a lack of career advancement paths at our local office so I am choosing to look else where for employment.
bad,High pressure. Jobs had to be completed in a given time frame or you impact the rest of the work down line. This makes for a very intense fast pace environment. If you are not up to speed your co-workers throw you to the lions.
bad,"*Always try to achieve my goals and I'm willing to learn and adapt to changes."
bad,"work long hours and training was non-existent, was not set up with proper tools when I started the job to do the job effectively.    "
bad,Work days can vary from 8-10 hr days and its only two shifts. I learned all of the basic job needs to fulfill the material handler 1 role. Management team doesn't have an understanding on warehouse needs and they are very experienced when it comes to warehouse work. They only care for themselves and don't at least try to take cares of the problems employees face each day. They tend to blame the employees for any kind of reason possible. They don't Acknowledge how hard you work and how the team works. Co-workers come from either a temp agency rarely hired on. Fun cool people easy to work with. The hardest part is dealing with management and trying to have them understand certain things. The most enjoyable is the amount of teamwork you do with your co-workers.
bad,Coworker are great to work with.all the free coffee and tea you want to drink all the hardest part of the job is waiting for ups to come at 3:oopm
bad,"For the position I was working, I was very over qualified and under compensated.  Management is not very clear about what they expect or want from their employees. Stable job security if you're able to get anything other than a contract position."
bad,It is a very odd place to work.  Some aspects are good but most are bad.  Good benefits and sometimes free meals.   Overly managed or rather mismanaged.  Constant management indecision and turn over.  Been there 5 years and have gone through 4 different plant managers.  Excellent people with 30 years experience let go for no reason while other people who hardly work are kept on.  Constant hurry up and wait mentality.  No accountability for management while the average worker is constantly scrutinized.  Some managers will take off a whole month at a time while other workers are forced to work even when sick.  Job security is often threatened to keep workers inline.  An almost military dictatorship.  Pay is poor and raises are none to bad.  I would not recommend working here.
bad,"Products are great"
bad,"I worked there for 17 years ad when I took over the computer's and network I had to worry that my boss would listen to his ""buddy"" over me and my contractors. This happened several times and when it came to down sizing I was laid off and the bosses buddy that was doing very little since they were phasing out his equipment he was kept on and they found other stuff to do."
bad,"I worked in the Customer Service Departmetn for the Healthcare Division. Good opportunity for ongoing trainings for new products, etc. This is a call center environment, they would time you when you went to the restroom. They also monitor your calls on a regular basis. I was recognized on several occassions for going the extra mile. They pay could be much better."
bad,Company offers excellent benefits including 3 weeks vacation from start. Poor working environment  in Export Compliance Department.  Management and HR were both omissive.
bad,"Je n ai pas du tout aimé l ambiance "
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,This job has you work a lot of overtime. The Job/Life balance is not good. A typical work day consists doing your job so the line can run properly. You are not required to socialize
bad,"Management do not worry about the employees, as long as they are being taken care of. The overall experience of working with great people is the reason why most employees have been there so long."
bad,"I have mixed feelings about my experience at the company. On one hand, I had excellent opportunities for growth and interaction with senior executives. On the other hand, my direct colleagues spoke badly about people behind their backs and undermined other colleagues they didn't like, and the department manager condoned the bullying when concerns were raised. Other leaders cultivated much healthier environments and cultures, so your experience really depends on who you work with."
bad,"Too many departments doing things differently, no focus on growing employees. Management does not take the time to understand and support the career paths of their direct reports. Employees do not feel valued.  Values safety and quantity over quality."
bad,Equipment shuts down often and in constant need of repair. They are willing to hold on to supervisors that are clearly not right for the job. The company continues to bring in people who are just willing to come to work when they feel like. Pay starts at 14 and goes up at BEST 3 percent yearly. Don't expect that right away either.
bad,"Core business is very scientific based. Everything must follow process and procedure even outside of the lab. If you did not fit in to the culture you did not feel very welcome."
bad,Couldn't they have told me BEFORE I went to all the trouble to enter my information that I had applied to the job a month ago????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Day-to-day was extremely difficult with many people who refused to advance manufacturing technology into the modern era. Many of the employees are amazing, and care very much about the product they make and ship."
bad,"I was hired for the back-fill of a longtime and important analyst roll. Weeks before moving from another state to take the job, they changed the job/offer to temp-to-hire. After getting very reassuring comments from HR and would be Director, I took the job and moved. The work was challenging but fun and rewarding. Unfortunately my trainer was, and had been, grossly over worked, so after a few weeks of training she told me she did not have the time to answer any more questions that might come up. As it came time for my temp status to change, I contacted my leadership to set up a meeting. I was told that due to unfavorable company financial quarter results I would continue in a temp status, with less pay and no benefits. I was reassured that it was just temporary and that as my position was in the budget, in a few weeks I would be made full employee. Not long after that word came down that there were to be layoffs in the accounting section of my department. As I was an analyst, my job was not in scope of the layoffs. When this was announced leadership promised that no one affected would lose their job for another 4 months. Those positions eliminated would still be employed through the next year and would have the full support of the leadership in finding new employment.  Then one Monday afternoon without notice I was informed that due to  reorganizing of tasks in conjunction with the layoffs, that my position was no longer needed. I was not given the same time everyone else was promised but told I was not needed to return at all."
bad,wasn't too bad a job until new managers started. the benefits and the paid time off are the only upside to working here anymore. lack of communication. there is no employee handbook or written guidelines to follow .
bad,Management request information in an expedite manner which pushes everyday duties behind.   Thermo Fisher is a big company that loses connection to with the employees.
bad,"While I enjoyed my time there. It tends to be a bit clique like. Sometimes I felt that I was back in high school. The job itself is extremely hard on your body, especially your back and shoulders. But it is enjoyable work if you get put in an area where they love to do their job."
bad,Company focuses on buying other companies to grow and doesn't invest in current work force.  If production falls behind instead of hiring more people they just make employees work harder via overtime and weekends.
bad,"If you're not a religious person or ""different"" stay far away from this place. These people will do whatever it takes to run you out of there."
bad,"A typical day consists of answering calls from customers, taking orders, issuing quotes and answering questions regarding our products and sedrvices."
bad,"Found there to be a general lack of leadership within this company.  This is pretty standard large company, not a great place to work."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"You can climb all the way up the ladder at Life Tech, and fast but the whole company is built on sand and will wash away with so many other of its ilk."
bad,GOOD PAY not bad health insurance but supervisor was awfully need someone who will work on floor when orders get behind do to a holiday.
bad,"Cons:"
bad,"The people were great to work with, even the department management, but as you move closer to corporate you see a shift to less care more self service. They plan shutdowns and maintenance without considering the real requirements of the things needed to be done often resulting in poor quality for the holidays for home life as that is when  maintenance is done (4th of July week and Christmas to New Years), and overages on time and complaints when it is not done when they want it despite telling management that we needed this time to do it per instructions on who the maintenance is suppose to go (like how long one must circulate a chemical to ensure killing all bacteria in a medical clean system)."
bad,"Difficile avere equilibrio vita lavorativa vita privata."
bad,"Die Firma wird durch die langjährigen und erfahrenden Mitarbeiter am Leben gehalten. "
bad,"Nice paying job for Cache Valley but hard to advance in position/roles.  Overworked in the summers due to overtime back to back on weekends. Management is absolutely awful.  They will go with the written rules at first but then when its conveneient for the company, they will gladly break and go against those rules.  Don't really care about their employees, we are just mules to them and it shows with how they treat the employees."
bad,"Huge company that will keep on growing. Site in Tijuana is open spaced with a laid back attitude and mostly young engineers that make the site seem energetic. "
bad,"When I first started I loved going to work. This was for the first 1.5 years. "
bad,"I had a 6 month contract. The compensation was very generous.  The people I worked with were wonderful. However, the IT department was not responsive and the culture is very political and at times hostile. If the politics worked better, it could be a much better place to work."
bad,"My fellow employees are great!  The problem is the pay & management team...  Hopefully with this new regime it'll get a lot better.  To add to my ""Compensation/Benefits"" rating, I put 3 stars because of my benefits!  The benefits are different for the new employees & if I had to rate it based on the new benefits it would definitely drop to only 2 stars."
bad,"Peninsula laboratories was located in San Corlos, CA. The company manufactured peptides for diagnostics and clinical trials. The company was acquired and now is closed."
bad,"I will admit I made some good friends while I was working at Thermo. Overall though I was not happy with my job. A lot of the time certain people were lazy and just did not feel like they had to do more than what they already did. People always complained about the job they had to do. When I went to work, I went to do my job. I did the best that I could do. "
bad,A typical 9 to 5 job with no appreciation from upper management.  Company encouraged employees moving up if a desired position opened up but supervisors would not approve or ease the workload in order for one to succeed.
bad,"The job was straightforward, just placing orders and following up on back ordered items. The computer system was VERY outdated and difficult to learn. There were only 2 employees of Thermo Fisher working in a University of Minnesota building as vendors, and the other employee made it very unpleasant to be there. An overbearing attitude and constant monitoring bordering on the paranoid made for a rather toxic environment."
bad,To many people at the job want to be bosses and talk too u the wrong way. Plus to many supervisor have there favorite people that they cool with. And they make poor judgment on good people...
bad,Good opportunity for establishing new protocols with opportunity as company grows with new client projects and acquiring new contracts in the healthcare industry
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
bad,"fast paced company to work for "
bad,I don't care to give a review on this company at this time. I don't have anything to really say except it was a great location for me to get to work....
bad,"Not sure about the company now, but when I worked there employees were treated as expendable commodities, much like the companies they would buy and sell.  They brought our product from being a wholly owned subsidiary into one of the corporate divisions, and milked it like a cash cow.   Leadership failed to provide any strategic direction, and the product was sold off once it was useless to them."
bad,"Soul sucking hole"
bad,"The work/life balance was great. My personal supervisor in Quality Control was the best I ever had.The co-workers I had were great. The job I had was actually enjoyable. The only thing I would have changed was to add a database like LIMS to take care of the day to day metrics, which also would have put me out of a job."
bad,work environment wasn't enjoyable. leadership sucks and everything is always your fault even when its theirs. If you want to get a raise than shouldn't work there
bad,"work can be stressful and fast paced..depending what department you work in,management grade changes.good benefits and 401K is included. holidays off which is great."
bad,All the days are typical since I have been far away to my personal life  and other than that being enjoyed my job with all my staff and able to learn a new part of the subject on daily basis.
bad,Easy work at a highly fast pace with plenty of opportunity for overtime
bad,"Okay company to work for, could have been a friendlier atmosphere."
bad,"Previously worked here "
bad,A typical is a very structured day of opening numerous reports to get an idea of what customer to call. Then check emails and voice messages. They use a metrix system to track you which is not realistic .
bad,"7:30AM-4PM or 3:30PM-12AM Overtime if offered"
bad,"Great customer and great equipment "
good,"Daily security operations but no long term advancement. "
good,"great place to work for short time"
good,Low morale and heavy micro management . Low salaries. No flexibility.  Unprofessional management. It's not about what you know but who you know in management that may like you.
good,"Great place to work, the people are what have kept me there for three years.  When asked about advancement to a higher roll i was told there would be none in the current department i'm in."
good,"SLT is completely unaware of what the managers do, turnover is high, recognition and advancement is not available if you're not part of the old boys network."
good,"Routine type of work, co workers are good, but management demands a lot from you, without compensation for your hard work."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"the job was really great and exciting you get to meet different people "
good,"Clearly does care for themselves management is  Big on this you go this if you are more knowledgeable than the person in a position of power it does not matter. It is clear they need new management. Specifically in the maintenance department, I have never seen a worst lead in my life."
good,"It is a great company to work for knowing you are helping the research community, however mamagement is very lack luster in the position I worked, with absolutely no care for work life balance. I was really disappointed to leave the company as I really liked knowing I was helping change the world, but management definitely drove me out"
good,"Enjoyed my job, I believed in what I was doing, but management need to be trained on how to be a Manager. "
good,Id prefer to work someplace that works to foster a more cooperative environment focused on team building. I want to work somewhere where I feel comfortable sharing ideas with my coworkers and that we can build on each others thinking together instead of having to watch my back for other people trying to steal my data. I think if management was more involved then 'credit' would be given where its deserved and you'd have people working more to do a good job rather than clawing to grab managements attention :(
good,"The company paradigm is that safety comes first, but it is often noted that money is the driving motivator at Thermo Fisher Scientific.  Chemicals that should be used in an anoxic environment are commonly carried around with barely a concern for PPE."
good,"Wouldn’t recommend, bad management. HR sucks doesn’t help employees. Company always pick managements side. Other employees are always in everyone’s business."
good,Got fired because i had to take my son to the dentist. How is that fair? It isn't. They wouldnt allow me to take emergency phone calls or anything. People got treated better then others
good,flex working hours/ easy to access to building/ friendly co-worker./ working with team / all the production set by the department.  half hours lunch break.
good,Not recommend for long term.Company is good but can't rely on HR and Management. Not able to build career and vision is clear but not able to allow us to successful
good,"Start here as a contract, no direction from my lead engineer.  Lead engineer had no background in mechanical design & drafting.  Pretty much do it yourself.  No idea where to start your project.  No support from management.  "
good,Very low morale and no room for growth. Management is all about self and does not recognize that life happens.
good,"In terms of culture and career advancement, this is not a good place to work. Very dominant style leadership style with the leadership team. Not a very collaborative work environment. Technicians were inspired by fear."
good,"A lot of functions with in the organizations don't effectively communicate with one another.  Sales thinks they can get away with whatever they want, they don't realize what the rest of the organization is trying to do is help them. Executives and upper management are discriminatory and think they are better then everyone else.  The opposite of leadership, if you ask me."
good,"No team work. Every department is for them self. So being in shipping we see everything last so we get it late. That doesn’t help when we have launch times to get the trucks out. Plus a lot of things are being done wrong here in Sed, but because it’s been done wrong for the last 10 years. I guess it’s ok to keep doing it wrong. Witch is not right at all."
good,"Great Company, but poor Marietta OH plant Mgt. There is also a Mid Ohio Valley environmental (air, water etc) challenges to deal with...so good luck working here! The workplace culture also sucks! There is no advancement opportunities here and the people brought from the shop floor to management positions have no leadership or management at all!"
good,"Management is unpredictable and are never on the same page. High turnover with a lot of temp employees. No accountability, poor management with low moral overall."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"no work life balance. "
good,Company has great learning abilities to help advance yourself towards future endeavors. Capability to advance from different departments throughout the company.
good,"As a technician I enjoy to work on my position.  However,  It would be a good company to work for if managements are more profession."
good,Not my best experience. Management was very out of touch with employees. They were more concerned with image than actual experience.
good,"As a publically traded company, Thermo has a tendency to be too focused on meeting revenue objectives only.  This single-minded mentality can take its toll on employee and customer satisfaction."
good,Tres bonne entreprise mais l'équipe est à revoir ?????
good,"Leiding is niet om over naar huis te schrijven, er wordt nogal eens gewisseld en te snel ondoordacht besloten om iets te doen waar later op terug wordt gekomen"
good,"Terrible culture, everyone is miserable, or don't care about advancing their career.  Management is Unpredictable, and everyone has a points system, which add up for the worst reasons, and can go against you, and take your share profit away."
good,"This site is very 'customer driven' being that they are a contract mfg site.  When business is good, the demand is high; when things are 'slow', customer demand is also lacking."
good,"Con: What makes this place unpleasant is the people. Management has little communication with employees. “My way or the highway” mentality."
good,They did things by the buddy system. They help you if they liked you.  They had certain people who they would advanced and showed favoritism to certain individuals.
good,Fair workplace and scheduling not altered but will receive required breaks and lunch as required by law.  Easy to use calendar to schedule PTO.  Good amount of PTO given and ability to buy additional time.  The hardest part of job is meeting expectations such as after call work.
good,"The work itself was a wonderful experience but my team were a bunch of gossipers who loved talking smack about each other. Very unprofessional. The lead often would start talking about his past life and the amount of women he had slept with, bragging about how much of a player he was, which is inappropriate. Without a doubt the guy is sexist. Communication with the managers was difficult, so if you want to get more training done you really need to ""stand out"" (Brown-nose your way in). They had their favorites. The only way to get anywhere in this ""job""(game) is to focus on yourself and worry only about yourself, you CAN NOT trust anyone there. They will try to make you fail and will never let you hear the end of it if you make one mistake. There is no ""i"" in team? um here at Thermo there is, sadly. If you apply, good luck and may the lord be with you."
good,"Great place to gain experience if you get to move around, then take that and go work for a company that appreciates, listens, PAYS, and actually values there employees."
good,"High paced production environment. OT is mandatory, available most of the year. Long work hours, unbalanced work life balance. No room for advancement."
good,"I have been in the Marketing department and can only speak to this immediate group. If you are a professional creative, this is a warning: unless you enjoy the corporate world of design, i.e. production work/templates/heavy oversight of projects... this is not the place for you."
good,"Decent job for the area. Start early and stay late. Plenty of overtime ""opportunities."" Advancement is highly unlikely. Management has gone downhill in the past few years, although there are a few managers on the floor that are great and don't get the credit they deserve. A lot of talented temporary employees are lost due to the company seemingly refusing to hire temporary employees."
good,"The company is over all a great company to work for. There are so elements of the staff that may keep you from becoming part of the team. The other problem with thermofisher, Is with the current mangement there is no room for growth."
good,公司文化比较激进，适合有能力有干劲的年轻人，领导比较看中数字，因此在里面工作压力非常大另外虽然每年在并购，可是内部整合做的很不好
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Advertised 75% travel, it was actually more like 100%. Pay and benefits starting out were fine, but advancement based on incentives that were un-obtainable. No career progression unless Master's degree, and willing to wait for 10+ years. Hardest part of the job was the travel, and the expectation of work on the weekends, and during time off. You were not allowed to talk to other parts of Thermo Fisher Scientific (i.e. refrigeration couldn't talk to lab, lab couldn't talk to DNA, DNA could speak with reagents), which speaks for itself on benefits and pay equality."
good,"Thermo Fisher is a good place to work and if you love what you are doing, its even better. Salaries are below market level. High manager turnovers in some groups which cause a lot of problems with continuity. Managers are also not equipped to handle difficult people so the rest of the team suffers."
good,was okay working there... I was hired perm with the company and faced challenges with a boss that had no experience with pharmaceuticals so that was challenging.
good,"The Company is great which attracts top talent.  However, the IT leadership is dysfunctional and immature.  The work/life balance in IT is poor and there is very little investment in IT resources.  The mantra is ""don't complain about having enough resources"" yet there is little investment in core technology."
good,"I liked working at the Thermo Fisher wharehouse. Laid back environment and friendly people. 2 ND shift was fairly easy to keep up with. I loved the job, until they transferred me to the main plant. The atmosphere was less friendly and management was biased with whom they liked."
good,"Thermo Fisher is a growing international company, the firm culture is friendly and there are multiple opportunities to participate in projects and tasks. The benefits program is complemented by health weeks and other activities."
good,"Executive Leaders have a good plan and vision. Managers lack resources and staff to execute the on this vision. Corporate HR selects lower salary candidates with less experienced over internal candidates with a proven track record on deliverables."
good,"Almost the same as working in big biopharma, the company is in transition from One Lambda to ThermoFisher, so there is plenty of changes happening right now."
good,start at 6 am busting your butt .I have acquired better leader ship skills. Most of our management team are really good and understanding people . As in any work place you have some great co workers and some not so good. The hardest part of the job is putting up with the high temperatures and humidity during the summer months .The fact that we are able to work and talk is the best part of my job.
good,"This was one of my least favorite jobs. While I gained experience, I often worked large amounts of overtime, compensation was not up to industry standards, and advancement was almost non-existant. On the upside they had pretty decent benefits and an excellent 401K matching program."
good,"A typical work day includes customer contact via telephones, email and fax.  The customer base is government, universities, municipalities, etc.Co-workers are fun to work with, however the environment can be intimidating.  Monthly report cards on employee performance are compiled and reviewed."
good,"Thermo was a very fast pace work i really enjoyed being able to work and listen to music I think it really helped with the my pace of work, did not enjoy the pressure they put on their workers though."
good,"My current position is all about numbers. Saving a large client money is very important, but it is also a very isolated job. The company as a whole is great, but, as we know each position varies."
good,"I will not review, I do not much to add about my experience. The experience is as expected for a large organization, that acquires other organizations"
good,"Work life balance is difficult in the financial community. Expect to work weekend, holidays, and receive phone calls while on PTO at month end. Stress level is high due to unrealistic deadlines."
good,Management distanced themselves. But overall staff very friendly and helpful. Management provided you with a buddy but not asked how you were getting on.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Su ambiente laborar puede mejorar en muchos aspectos; este puede empezar por su lider.
good,A rotating door of upper management and staffing of completely unqualified people is sales and marketing which is a problem when selling scientific instruments.
good,Executive leadership lacking vision at divisional level and little to no diversity in leadership. Develop standards that are beneficial to company and supports staff empowerment.
good,The equipment is a bit outdated and unsafe. I wasnt sure exactly what time i would get off because after we packed everything we had to then go pallet and shrink wrap it
good,"It was not a competitive pay but a great position, inclusive and supportive environment until we had a new GM. Turn over of employees in my subsidiary tripled and management doesn't seem to care. My supportive Manager left and her replacements are struggling under the work burden. One person can ruin it all for over 250 people."
good,"Aprendi muito nesta empresa e devo muito a ela. Empresa com objetivos fantástico e direcionados a vida. "
good,"Most employees feel overworked and underappreciated. Hence, quality work is not up to par not done to excellence. what i have noticed is that everyone does things according to the minimum. Especially due to many employees juggling multiple projects at once."
good,"Benifits are great, employee's aren't as friendly! The wages should increase because of all the work you have to do on a daily basis! It's a good work environment if you know people that already work there!"
good,"I was working with sterols for a 6 month contract in it's a very cold sterile environment socially as well as physically. The officers were unusually silent and it was really hard to get to know people. The project management was inferior and when anything went wrong the contractors were blamed, not the supervisor. Suggestions were not welcome. I would never work there again"
good,"the time table it wasn't suitable for me day, evening and night shift"
good,"The IT operates with the smallest numbers of employees and that ensures crazy schedules but challenging work environment. "
good,"Mis-managed factory caused the hours to be 50-60/ week."
good,I wanted to work at a company that was making a difference in peoples lives.  I found this at Thermo Fisher.  My site designs and manufactures X-Ray and Metal Detection equipment used to ensure safe foods and pharmaceuticals.
good,I left for what I thought was a wise decision financially. I didnt want to as the people were my family. Wish I hadnt. Its been a hard road since. The grass is NOT greener on the other side and they wont rehire
good,Its okay as far as working but not enough to live in the area due cost of living.  Management structure is redundant. Too many supervisor and manager but lacking of people taking actions.
good,"Fisher Scientific should be a better company than it is. The present Atlanta management if the worst you could ever see. People are expendable, just a piece of the machinery, no one is valued, or given any credit"
good,depending on the role you have within the company work/life balance difficult to impossible to maintain. you can easily find yourself working 8-12 hours days because of lack of support.
good,"Company is a complicated matrix environment "
good,"my experience in production is that you work 12 hours a day and have at least one mandatory overtime day each week. you have to work alternating weekends. we constantly get told we are doing a good job but mandatory overtime isn't going away. most people are very upset because it's been going on for years. the new manager has no idea what's going on and the production manager does not care about the workers as long as he can tell the people above him we can keep doing more even if it means working us non stop. many people do not stay for long. the other people there are good people, just management runs people out because they expect us to be robots and work non stop"
good,Been here 10 years this July. Have had 4 different managers of which only 1 tried to get us to interact with each other on a personal level.  The others only care about results.  Only 1 really talks to you if they see you are struggling at all.  The others just write you up or do not offer any help whatsoever.  It’s a “do as I say not as I do” mentality.   Very frustrating when you really want to do the right things but have to ask every time what that is that day because yesterday it was frowned upon but today it is fine.  Good pay and benefits though!
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Managers play favoritism, unfair decisions about your performance, poor training and culture at the company is very stressful. Micromanaging, no opportunities for development and great training."
good,"Very dynamic employees and a high paced environment.  Culture needs improvement."
good,"High potential performers are not rewarded. You are only rewarded and given opportunities if you know the right people or if you have a good relationship with your manager and not based on merit and accomplishments. Advancement opportunities are hard to come by.  The company says that they promote from within, but the hiring managers almost always hire external candidates. High potential performers continue to be given more work with very little in return except for a resume full of accomplishments that do not manifest in tangible assets. Leaders also make poor decisions at the top that results in downstream effects that negatively impact customer experience and creates more work for the lower level employees. Take a lesson from other innovative and progressive companies where business decisions are made closer to the ground. Take your own advice on culture and trust in the gemba talk."
good,I enjoyed working with my peers at this company however it is a place of many ideas and very little action because of 'no support' for the projects suggested.
good,"The pay is low than your worth. Lots of work for one person ."
good,"management in production are very difficult to work with they do ot listen to those working with the products and are very arrogant when trying to address an issue with them. they are not so cooperative if a shift change is needed for family, personal or other reasons unless you are in with the good ol boys club."
good,The work and people at Thermo-Fisher were great. I worked night shifts. It was stressful learning the dispenser position. Was fired for no reason. Management fired the entire night crew and no one knows why. The company would not tell us why.
good,"Just OK Oragnization. "
good,Life TechnologiesBV is een logistiek bedrijf waar een vast team van mensen het beleid bepaald. Veeleisend voor personeel.
good,"Good place to work, just not a lot of flexibility in the work stations. People are placed in jobs with no experience and don't get any room to grow inside the company."
good,"The day started much too early. For 20 years start time was 8 am to 4 pm. It is now 6:30 am to 3 pm. Supervisor support and advancement is hard to achieve.The benefits are wonderful and job security is great. Overtime seems to be available. The difficult part is learning to work with coworkers that make as much money as you and do less work. The harder you work the more you are pushed while the others are left alone to do ""Not much"". I loved learning about my coworkers nationalities."
good,"Diversité des tâches à effectuer avec une grande autonomie. "
good,"I have enjoyed working for the company, most of the middle management its engaged and there are plenty of opportunities for improving the business and to make a difference."
good,"A very strong company with a wide variety of manufactured lab ware specialty plastic products.  Interesting and challenging work.  Was able to learn operation of Jomar machines, Nissei machines and Uniloy machines.  Learned use of quality control measuring instruments.  Trained with SAP.  Very strict adherence for ISO 9001 and 14001 standards, as well as, OSHA and FDA requirements.  Follow routings and work standards.  Greatly enjoyed the variety of challenges.  Hardest part of job is working in a very poorly managed environment."
good,"A typical day at work is 8 hours of non stop data entry. I Work with internal and external customers. My internal customers including field managers, and field engineers are wonderful. I enjoy working with all field employees. I have been here for 14 years now and I have learned many things especially about the products my company sells, what they are used for, and their scientific discoveries. I enjoy having partnership, and being able to work with international sites of Life Technologies. This includes Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, and Japan."
good,Management is not committed to employees and does not hire outside the company
good,"One of my favorite parts of working for Life Technologies is working with many intelligent people from all over the world on cutting edge technology, in an industry with a promising future. Work-life balance can be difficult to maintain, despite lip service from upper management about the issue. Cost-cutting and constant change frequently challenge planning and execution of business initiatives. "
good,Great place to work and get involved in many projects to break any routine.
good,It is a good company poorly managed with top too heavy and lesser field force
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,It is good experience to work for Thermo Fisher with the exposure to various industries.
good,"Overall management is great. But there is a problem with ""legacy Employees"" being held to different, lower expectations. And HR constantly making it hard on Supervisors to manage their crews. And are too worried about Life Groups then the actual work that goes on. But the pay well, and if you can find the right managers, you will learn a lot."
good,The quality department is completely inflexible with hours. the company talks about work life balance but the quality department seems to contradict many things the company says
good,"Workload can be overwhelming but benefits are great. "
good,"When I began working at Thermo, they were just buying Life Technologies so lots of layoffs, and changes. Management was terrible, lots of turnover. Have opportunity to learn but takes years and depends on manager. Possibly other sites Thermo bought were more organized, but the transition was tough. I wanted to go further and learn more, but I was still new and kind of had to learn my place. Company party was canceled, less team building, less perks than Life Tech provided."
good,"My experience at Thermo was troubling. They had no concern for employees and regardless of how products were produced, they didn't put quality as a high concern."
good,"Working for Thermo is great, no two days are ever the same.  Management is slow to granting requests but they are held to standards by corporate.  Work-Life balance is not supported as managment keeps a lean crew, so this makes it hard to take time off.  But the people there are good people and make it enjoyable to come to work each day."
good,"Work like the world is ending the next day with no reward. Micro managed and favoritism is what this company is about. I loved the people but hated that the higher ups only cared about the numbers, not about its employees."
good,"Vous êtes libre d'organiser votre temps de travail."
good,When I first started I as excited but as the years dragged on monotony has set in. Iva asked for training to enhance my skills of which my request hasn't been granted. The amount of work I do I should be better payed
good,When you are a temp. Contractor for these science labs like Bio-Rad and Thermo fisher scientifric your just an extra hand to take a load of work away from full time employees.
good,"Within the organisation they find a good balance between job and life balance."
good,"Easy job, but has no career advancement. Few employees stay due to lack of career advancement. When you add in the low starting salaries it shows why the company is desperate for employees because they refuse to pay the necessary wages to live in the state of Maryland."
good,"Very boring and rote.  highly repetitive.  Very mind-numbing doing the same thing over and over again.  It was a documentation job, preparing for closing facility."
good,i did enjoy to work for fisher scientific but then unfortunately the management started to change a lot and the company has lost the biggest contract they had nd everything has gone down since then
good,"Typical day at work is high pace "
good,"Its a good job for younger person with all the hours you will have to work, but its not a job I would recommend if you have a family. The pay does not equal to the work and hours you put in."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Work day starts at 0630 with production meetings. The site is under staffed. I learned more about new manufacturing techniques. There is no human resources on site. There doesn't seem to be team work between groups. The hardest part of the job is not having the tools and parts to complete the job. The most enjoyable part of the job are the individuals.
good,There are good development opportunities through internal and external training. There is flexible work if approved by manager. Good team collaboration to get work completed on time.
good,"Constantly fighting with my direct supervisor due to unfair distribution of workloads. He refuses to address issues that I've brought in front of him, but instead actually DEFENDS the situation that is causing issues."
good,"The maintenance and manufacturing support group is micromanaged and suffers due to issues that could be easily resolved with better leadership.   The workforce is dedicated, hardworking, and experienced.  Management does not promote a culture of trust and confidence nor provide the right tools for the job in some cases endangering the workers."
good,Corporate work environment that is always looking at the final costs.  Looking for all possible cost cutting possibilities. Lots of overtime in the manufacturing departments.
good,"Thermo Fisher is a great company, but it, like everything else has its warts. The general structure of the company is that of a bolted together acquisition strategy. The idea is that they look at a company with a skill set they want to acquire then buy them and promote their new competence in that area. The way that sales are driven is to simply be a one stop shop option. They are not specialists in much. An exception is definitely Mass Spectrometry which is one of the few product areas that they seem to put effort into."
good,"It was not a great place to work, The management team showed favoritism and lack of focus on production. Long story short it felt like working on a reality show. No professionalism."
good,Expect to work 50+ hours weekly with little to no supervision or training.  The job is difficult with more skills needed than provided in job description.
good,"Career advancement is minimal. Talents and skills are not recognized individually. There are not enough recognition for workers. Expectations are high, and it can become stressful."
good,"Work and Life balance is great, but in the job. Management gives feedback that is not helpful. The culture here is pretty venomous among older staff and newer. There are incentives to tell on people. Management doesn't stand up for their workers, they lie to you and tell you that they will recommend you for promotions. Pay is not decent at all. The turnover here is ridiculously high. I feel people here don't think. We have supervisors without a degree, no experience. Research Department is a hot mess.  The wrong people are getting promoted."
good,"Hurry up and get it done.  There is no structure on hours or management. Your opinion doesn't matter.  Its how management sees is fit.  Also, pay role is a joke. Your hours have a 50% chance of being right.  Trying to fix it comes the following paycheck. (downhill snowball)"
good,"cutting edge technology, safe environment."
good,"Global company with great people to work with. especially with lower management individuals. "
good,"Good work/life balance, but relatively low pay.  There was very poor upper management when it comes to the business I was a part of.  We did not have the resources we needed to succeed."
good,management changes daily.  Try to do good but some people don't see it that way.  Few bad managers make everyone miserable. Good is that you can work remote for most positions. Company is too large.
good,The corporate culture is stressful because management will not listen to creative ideas. Benefits continued to decline over the number of years I worked for this company.
good,"Predictable days, repetitive work, low responsibility, no visibility for promotion, room for growth but current supervisors hold you back."
good,Very long days and expectations to be available 24x7. Many opportunities to learn many systems and many opportunities to move to other positions.
good,On phone all day.  Management listens in on calls and grades you.  Range of products is large and interesting.  Good place to work.
good,"Company and benefits are great. Short ceilings and long times to promotion. Work is pretty exciting and can change day to day. Culture is pretty stagnant with people not wanting to interact and go out together, would rather just go home."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,People are nice to work with management is not that great. If they would give me more pay and benefits I would be happy here .
good,"The company is quite nice but management think more about production and machines than people."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers.  A typical work week is fairly standard.  "
good,Management was Pushing less home life so people where jumping ship.  After all this the VP & GM of our BU was let go by Corp. but this was to little to late.
good,You never know if you are going to work or not or if you are going to get in atleast 8 hours a day.
good,"Day to day is always different in operations, depending on if there are any fires to put out that day. In my own experience, I have had good and bad management, and I would say that overall, it is below average. I have been promised things that never ended up happening, and almost forgotten about for weeks at a time from my direct supervisor. I guess that could be taken as a pro or a con, but it was often frustrating waiting to hear back. I feel like I do more than my fair share, often taking on my boss's tasks with little or no"
good,"I worked in the call customer providing customer service. I was on the telephone 90% of the time. The customers were generally placing order for health care items. They were generally friendly and cooperative. My coworkers were good, hardworking people. I loved the hygiene factors of the job, and an on site cafeteria, They would celebrate birthdays, special occasions, Secret Santa, etc. They provided a comfortable working environment, but no real career path for customer service representatives in the call center."
good,Building managed by HR department. Currently going through a new Branding process.
good,"Approving all Purchase Orders, handling RFQ's, vendor negotiating, setting standard costs for 2013"
good,"This company has a great compensation package for people who are hired directly, however if you are unfortunate to have been part of a merger into this company, they will freeze your pay at whatever it was at the time of acquisition."
good,"It just was one of those jobs that they tell you that the grass is greener, but after it is mowed, it is the same shade as the last place I was working."
good,This was the most toxic atmosphere I have ever worked in. The wages are low but you can work seven days a week.
good,"High turn-over in middle management, you will never know who is in charge from week to week. Loved working with the people, a diverse, and hard working bunch of great people who will have your back!"
good,Enjoyed working there.  Great learning environment.  Would have been happy to continue to work there.  Took too long to transition from contractor to full time employee.  Pay as contractor did not equate to the amount of work I was doing
good,Human Resource and Management Office Don't Respect Employees Even though Job is Unionized. Opportunity for Advancement comes with time put in and you must place bids to any new position posted on bulletin board.
good,"Fast pace environment was initially energizing, but ultimately led to burn out without the available resources and support to alleviate work load."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,It is a good company to work for but local management needs to be more involved in employees issues and work life balance should be implemented from the policy.
good,Thermofisher is a fast paced self managed work space. opportunity exists to self educate for advancement with improved skill set. my job as a remote field service engineer would take me to travel to different  geographical areas of the region meeting new people and solving sometimes unique problems. Interaction with other engineers to solve issues was a plus. Travel was sometimes a problem with family responsibilities can suffer.
good,"The company is pretty good but the Millersburg plant is on lower level. Although the plant earns a lot of profit but due to recent expansion projects it would take few years to get the culture fixed. Due to its poor location area, you will find uninteresting and sometimes less professional management. However, because the plant's culture is still same as of small company, the jobs are a little relaxed and there are not much to do sometimes. Based on product demand, the plant future is bright for coming 10-15 years at least. "
good,"Work loads they gave you doesn’t match the pay you get compared to other co-workers who do the same type of job."
good,"It is not a bad company. It just is very fast paced, very high stress and not a very comfortable place to work. I like to be more relaxed in my environment, that is how i am more productive. I felt like there I was watched so close it made me nervous and the manager I had there was very moody and I felt as if she disliked me, so there was an awkwardness there. It was a very uncomfortable environment."
good,"Productive and simple workplace. The culture is OK, managers do not tend to micromanage the overall employees. The offices are old they need to update carpet and  office areas"
good,"Thermofisher is the same as any other work place, go into work do what you're meant to and go home. When I was working at thermofisher I learned that being out of your comfort zone isn't really all that bad, you make new friends and learn new things. Management was as expected, strict to a certain extent and always reminding you to abide by the policy rules. The work place culture was different, was old and young workers and it was strange at the start but then easy to get used to and make new friends, the hardest part of the job I think personally was trying to stay awake on a night shift and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people there."
good,"Sit in your cube, do your work, leave. Some good people working there, though. Boss was a nice guy. Most of my coworkers were kind and inviting. Company culture overall, however, was monotonous."
good,Easy work but not something would consider career making. Lunch was the best they have a video game system so lots of us would play classic games on the ps3.
good,"You'll find that it's difficult to balance out priorities since too many things are going on at one time. Good for entry level people to learn, but for more established people in the field, unless you're looking for many challenges and opportunities to improve faulty systems, this may not be the best option."
good,"While working at Thermo Fisher Scientific, I found it hard to negotiate any upward mobility. The environment made it difficult to train in new areas because everyone working was over wrought with work. Often times the orders needed exceeded the laws of time and physics and the ability of our machines and people to keep up.  The actual building itself was a health and safety hazard, leading in my opinion, to a lot of illnesses in my former co workers. But, it was a job, we got benefits, so I can't complain about everything."
good,"Company pays very well, lots of opportunity to learn new things but culture there was very tough to deal with. Strictly bottom line focus without much regard to employee well being."
good,Overall a good experience working at thermo fisher. Good people all around but the work was not something I would want to pursue as a career. It was a good place for me to build up my skills.
good,"Good balance of work and personal life. The hardest part is that the work load isn’t compensated fairly. They provide yearly bonuses and yearly raise, but I don’t think there are fair on work load by team members"
good,"I was a contracted temp-to-hire employee that was praised endlessly, but couldn't get hired permanently because of fiscal concerns. This is a mulit-billion dollar company that is making money, not losing money, so they were getting my hard work at a very cheap price because I didn't receive any benefits.  In general I felt used, under-appreciated, and didn't personally enjoy my time there."
good,"I have had 6 different managers in 8 years at Thermo. This causes constant changes in the way we report and operate. I believe most of the sales team see the force as being unstable because of this. Job security is something employees should not have to worry about especially if they are making or exceeding their goals. A typical work day entails working with channel partners, instrument, life science and chemical partners seeing customers and meetings to discuss strategies and follow up. I also see customers for direct business."
good,Working at Thermo Fisher was pleasant and I learned a lot about material handling and the importance of it.  Th paid thirty minute lunch break was a nice compensation and the two 15 minutes were also great.
good,"In my role, we are not supposed to work overtime, but the reality of my position and small team size is that we have to.  Each week I work about 10 hours that I do not get paid for, but it is necessary to adequately support our customers and sales team. "
good,"Thermo Fisher is the largest life science service provider in the world with over 65,000 employees and counting. They have a mission to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer with their products and services. Thermo generally hires very good sales people and I am proud to have collaborated with them to land new business. Thermo can be a good company to work for if you select the right division. Their higher technology instruments divisions are the best places to start."
good,"Some employees have celebrated 10, 15, 20 to 25 years anniversary! If people have stayed with the company that long, something good must be going on for them to stay."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"I enjoyed my position at Thermo Fisher, but the downfall was lack of communication between management to employees. The chemists are great to learn from and are willing to explain what they sre doing and the purpose. they have a great lunch area."
good,"tiny raises from .15 to .50 cents, no real reason to overachieve. always understaffed cause of low pay and bad treatment towards temps/employees. the company expects above and beyond yet gives so little for hard work when understaffed 4 of 8 workers in some departments. pay needs to be raised to a reflet price of living and other competition from other business that need warehouse workers. and other issues like they will keep you in a department if you do very well and won't let you transfer to another cause they don't want you to."
good,Management is slow to pick up on recent developments and business side of things always wins over science. In general scientists are treated as cogs to the machine of biz devs self-glorification.
good,My job was to cycle count the inventory for a bio tech company. I also took care of all metrics to send to managers.  Worked with the labs to make sure their inventory was accurate and dealt with auditors.
good,"The pay was competitive and benefits were pretty reasonable."
good,"Management help everyone and balanced."
good,"The division I worked in was VERY political, non-collaborateive, and overall a tense environment. I do hear that other divisions are very well run, a lot of potential for growth, and it's fun to go to work every day. However, in the division I worked for, this was not the case. Leadership was very quick to ""remove"" anyone they thought was a threat to their kingdoms, making it a very uncomfortable environment."
good,durchschnittliches Unternehmen mit guten Produkten
good,Pays well/benefits are great.  Work life balance is terrible.  In a warehouse as a salary employee expect to work 60+ hrs/wk and weekends as needed.  The culture is dictated by management employees that are rarely in the building and there is alot of pressure put on DC managers to accomplish the impossible.  Hardest part of the job is the lack of worklife balance.  Most enjoyable was some of the relationships that have been made.
good,You must be a self motivator to do this position with integrity.  The job is very rewarding.  The only downside is that it is a contract position so if the host company decides to go with another company there is a great possibility that your position will be eliminated.
good,"I travelled a lot for my position, ~75% of the time was spent on the road. I was a technical sales consultant. I learnt a lot about the industry, a lot about the diagnostic testing, customer service, working on a travel budget and taking responsibility for my actions because the amount of work I put in almost always equated to how much sales occurred in the territory. The management was quite hands off. The job security was definitely there but it also meant that there was no progression, as the rungs of the ladder were pretty much full. The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job was the travel - being away from home so much was tough but at the same time I got to meet a lot of different people and forge great relationships as well as travel and see new places."
good,"this was my first job out of college. the job description stated that a BS degree was required; however, the work was very mundane and not upward career growth and no stimulating work."
good,Although the starting salaries are not great.  If you knuckle down and show what you can do.  Opportunities will arise where you can progress upwards.
good,"Typical day involved first attending a meeting to find out what products were already manufactured during the earlier shift while learning what was expected to be produced - this included finding out if the were any issues with the equipment or products. Management would alter production schedules around significant errors and listen to any concerns. Once at my station, I would be responsible for my paperwork and checking the production line for any errors or defects, and assisting my coworkers when required; this was the most time-consuming and monotonous aspect of the job. At the end of day, ensuring proper paperwork had been filled out and cleaning of station and equipment while readying for the next day."
good,"While many of the people that I worked with were nice, there was an almost impossible route for advancement, and very little training and educational opportunity."
good,"The company is very large so every site is different (i would believe).  The site that I worked at is very metrics driven but the metrics being chosen to follow did not really give a good representation of the group that I worked in.  The coworkers at the site are a mix of self motivated, daily grinders, lifers, and first jobbers.  There are always opportunities to do more and learn anything that goes on at the site as long as you make time for it."
good,Scheduling seems very unorganized.  Compensation is a little unfair between shifts. 2nd got $1.25 raise due to high turnover rate while first shift wasn't given anything.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Thermo Fisher Loves slogans. They love to talk about employee surveys, and they spend a lot of money to do these surveys. But nothing happens and every thing stays the same. Management always try to convince their subordinates about how great the job prospective is and that things will get better then nothing happens."
good,"Thermo Scientific used to be a great place to work when the division here was doing well. There is a lot of regular management restructuring and they have been cutting back personnel on a regular basis for about 5 years or so. They pay well, but the health insurance/benefits is not good if you need it. This is also not the place for someone who desires a good work-life balance due to all the staffing cut backs that have left most areas short-staffed. The general environment and culture has deteriorated, but there are still a lot of good people there. I would not recommend this location within Thermo due to this overall decline."
good,"Decent work place with great workers, but lacking in leadership. Compensation does not meet the type of work being performed."
good,"Busy place to work, but a lot of the time its working harder, but not always smarter. Oppurtunities for advancement are very limited. Hard to want to strive higher, when the light doesn't look very bright."
good,"Most important part is that there is work freedom."
good,The new system has really slowed things down. There have been several days where we did not have to come to work due to the system.
good,"When I began my career with Thermofisher it was a great place to work. They were involved with training and truly valued managers and employees. However, there was a major divesture and selling off of a division in our plant and it was all downhill from there. I feel they lost track of what was really important. Regardless of what was going on with all the changes those who still cared really tried to keep the employees upbeat, but you could see it on everyone's faces that it was not the same company we were working for anymore."
good,"family oriented, pay is horrible, management can be a little sketchy at times, but overall its a decent place to work. please i dont have anymore to say"
good,"Great launching point for the research and academic sales market because you can get a broad knowledge base of products sold into research market.  "
good,Not very constant work day may be 8 hours or it my be 3 hours.It makes it very hard to make a living.
good,"prefer not to answer... Many good employees are an asset but unable to move into one operations after multiple acquisitions."
good,"Nice place to work, but management is not all that great."
good,Mandatory pre-lab exercise with few perks but high pay rate.  Not going to say much else because my experience was brief and second shift.
good,"Great people to work with, very challenging work, just way too much of it.  As much as you would give, management was always asking for more.  There were too many priorities and they were always changing.  Difficult to get anything done when you can't stay the course."
good,"World wide corp with good pay and a closed social atmissphere, a typical day included the close check of 240 plastic injection mold machines Hydrolics / lubrication / machanical"
good,Need to provide proper work/life balance for employees with families.
good,"At my present workplace, it is a very fast-paced environment.  Both incoming and outgoing phone calls from/to Account members in need of chemicals, medical products, lab equipment and consumables. Team-oriented environment.  I have learned to utilize time management skills to resolve issues with consumers, as well as assisting external Sales Representatives needing order management assistance and quotations. Due to the amount of incoming calls, the greatest challenge is finding adequate time to take care of each issue involving orders, timely shipments and account management.  The most enjoyable facet of the position is interaction with both external and internal customers and the opportunity to resolve escalated issues. "
good,Inspect vials make sure that things are correct pack them to be shipped out fill out paper work that shows everything the packing intells
good,A typical day at work - Hectic.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Veel mailcontact met klanten, zelfstandige job, leuke collega's"
good,"In a recently acquired portion of it. A lot of changes. Sometimes things don't work out right. Interesting technology. Expectations can vary a lot from realities. Depends on how you arrive. Probably better for a new hire, but watch out."
good,"Ok Place to work, however pay scale needs to be raised. Needs to upgrade equipment for the 80's."
good,"Diversité des produits permet de découvrir un domaine de haute technologie."
good,"Thermo is a very large company and has the typical pros and cons of a large corporation:"
good,Thermo Fisher has fantastic employees but has become more conservative over time and is currently more focused on commercialization than enabling groundbreaking innovation.
good,"I'm a contractor and not available to apply for jobs within the company.great job to have. good hours, good pay, but no advancement in the future. Good people."
good,good to do job here.very friendly company. work culture is good.good to start as a newcomer here it gives good opportunity to as new hires and also comfortable time to learn
good,"Fast paced work environment, always able keep busy , time goes by fast . Work as a team or independently, courses and training provided to advance your skills. Quarterly bonuses ."
good,"This company has a great working environment. Great work schedule. "
good,Good place to work. Enjoyed learning in a new environment ..customers really know the name and like the product sold by Fisher.. good place to start or end your career.
good,"The environment is very professional, and the Company's mission to enable their customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer is fantastic!"
good,The company in general had no culture.  Great place to learn and grow but fairly high turnover.  It was made up a number of acquisitions that were never integrated into a single culture.
good,"Head guy thinks hes better than everyone and very lazy, stares at you and try's to critique you when. He has no clue what hes doing, always late etc...."
good,"I feel Themo are either bad or particularly good to work for."
good,"Best tech stack"
good,"The other field service employees are second to none, they really know their stuff and are always willing to help. Unfortunately management doesn't do what's needed to keep good employees. Pay for field service is sub par with little opportunity to advance (with the exception of being based in the home Kalamazoo office). A lot of focus is put on the sales team, but they forget that with only 4 different instruments (that have been the same for over 20 years) the reason people keep buying them is because of the level of service they receive."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,I was a contracted employee for the position of assisting the inventory department while they trained and consequently implemented a new management software program for controling inventory and order processing.
good,"-Lack of job opportunity."
good,"I held several positions throughout my time at Thermo Fisher Scientific. Throughout, all but one of positions included extremely hands-off managers. That isn't necessarily representative, but at the time the San Jose site had several managers who didn't give terribly clear direction and left me to sink or swim. I was able to thrive in that environment but not everyone would."
good,"Overall coworkers and benefits are great, however work life balance does not exist.  Expectations even when on PTO is to always be available.  I never feel the ability to truly disconnect for a week at a time."
good,this is good place to work. i love to work there but got better job also i am having backbone pain so i left there. i learn more things from there. every things most enjoyable for me
good,Average company to work for Good py Lots of travel in the Field Service Department.  They need MORE Technicians in the Field.  You are kept VERY Busy.
good,The hours could be long and tedius. They could also change from the time you walked in the door until your last break. That was one of the nice things...we got 2-4(depending of length of shift) 15min breaks and a 1/2hour lunch.
good,"Ever changing corporate structure, no true investment in advancing careers below management, frequent shifting of positions and turnaround makes for completing projects with a stable core team"
good,"Hundreds of jobs have gone or are going to other countries at this point.  Job security and satisfaction low.  Nice people to work with, although many work from home.  That can be a nice benefit."
good,They work you like a machine and don't care about advancing people. I've been there 3+ years now and I am still making the same amount of pay that a new hire is. Even though I am trained in multiple positions.
good,"Typical work day consists of 50% trying to get product to customers or dealing with customer issues"
good,"The Manager here is on a power trip. You are monitored around the clock, even when you go to the bathroom and how long you've been in there. They say work attire is business casual, but in actuality they want you to dress like a grandma since the branch manager has no sense of fashion. They will fire you for just about anything."
good,Thermo fisher scientific is a great place to work if your permanent. As a temporary employee its hard to adapt to less pay performing the same job duties as the permanent.  Temporary employees work a lot of hours with no benefits. At this point the company is changing over to thermo fisher so change is definitely in effect
good,"I worked in Regulatory Affairs and learned a lot. My boss the the VP of Regulatory affairs and we worked well together. Everyone was great there, except for one individual and from I understand, he's no longer there. Neither is my precious boss."
good,Hard place 2 work for no proper training given dont appriciate good workers we make plastic mouldings make petri dishes been workin there 15 yrs we do rotating shifts and some do continental shifts
good,I have no tips nor do I want to talk about thermo it is a job and nice job for this area so there ya go I would work there again if had to most employees are very nice good people
good,"The hardest part of the job is when you realize you're only as fast as your weakest link. If someone in the production line is slow and they don't move fast normally, that particular task can get very slow and boring after a while. There isn't much enforcement either. Too many employees waiting to be told what to do rather than taking initiative. Its a ""what will I get out of it"" culture sometimes."
good,A good experience. Very fast paced with many priorities. Would recommend a better work life balance and a clearer path for growth opportunities. There are so many smart people to learn from
good,thermo fisher is not a bad company to work for. they pay pretty good for the work they ask and the benefits are pretty good. there is growth but your have to work for it
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Jusqu'en 2015 j'avais toute autonomie pour atteindre mes budgets et cela marchait bien pour moi.."
good,"Too many meetings that would cut into production times,too many surveys (the CEO is California)? ,constantly changing SOP's  after opening new plant in Scotland-requiring your training file because they added new flag ?Then mandatory overtime to caugh up !"
good,"Fast paced, international company with long working hours and highly stressful at times. "
good,"The environment is not harsh, however, expect to encounter the same favoritism and politics that you find most anywhere in a typical warehouse. If you're expecting a decent raise for doing more work, you can forget it; people who take smoke breaks every hour on the hour will get the same raise as you even if you are working your fingers to the bone. If you want a basic job to pay the bills, go for it, but if you're looking to advance quickly or expect fair pay for your work, then don't bother."
good,"Thermo is a good company to work for.  Very flexible in work time options ie: modified work week, remote working (work from home), combination of modified work week and work from home, depending on position.  Not much in way of training in some areas."
good,"A good place to get started as there is good support to get you started in the industry. Not having to explain to anyone who you are is always a plus. But like any big companies it is unwieldy and slow to adapt. The company is so big with so many rep and products, it is hard to keep a high level of competence. Inevitably some people are just along for the ride and you have to pick up their slack if you want to make your number."
good,Types of products manufactured are helping make the world safer and help cure diseases. Company is growing and the culture is changing- not for the good.   A lot of red tape to get things done. IT department is very bureaucratic.  Company is moving accounting and finance jobs outside of the US.  Benefits and good. Recent change in CFO which has been positive.
good,The facility in Rochester is rather old as is most of the machinery being used every day.  Too many of the large machines are capacity constrained and have outlived their useful life and only continue to run with extreme maintenance and a little bit of good fortune.  The anticipated growth brought on by the continuous acquisitions will ultimately require huge capital investment in Rochester or movement of its products to other facilities with more state of the art molding processes.
good,The products were good and I had good technical support but unfortunately support from senior management was lacking regarding the big projects I was working on with Rio Tinto and Yancoal
good,"Moved from shipping associate to a step above shipping associate and am currently ""stuck"" with little possibility of advancement.  Work on a day to day basis is fair.  Some days very stressful and others are great days.  Find myself doing a lot of work that I consider above my title or pay scale."
good,"A typical day at work begins with recording one's production goal for the day. After that, solutions that will be used throughout the day will need to be prepared. The assembling of chromatography columns will then begin, as well as the packing of them with specific types of resin. After the packing, the different methods of testing start. At the end of the testing, data is interpreted and analyzed."
good,"Thermo Fisher was a fun place to work in the beginning, however the work quickly dried up. Due to their use of outside agencies the amount of work available out of the Carlsbad office decreased dramatically."
good,"Thermo Fisher is a fortune 200 company with a great reputation. They offer continued learning and encourage their employees to discover their own career path. There is poor Management in quite a few departments, but the workers are great people. It has been difficult to move around the company without a Science/Chem background."
good,"I learned from this company a lot in my professional carrier."
good,The company turnover is huge and they give field exposure to all engineers. It has a good rapport with all types of customers in terms of support. All engineers are working with dedications & nice work culture.
good,Fairly decent place to work at but management isn't very good with some managers watching your every move and not having a good understanding of the machines.  Kept changing the rules and added too much work load on some people who can't manage it.
good,"The typical day of work was listening to our manager tell us where we were lacking and how they believed that we could improve. As well as performing mandatory excercises."
good,"Good company overall to work for. Global company, with individualized instrumentation. Work/life Balance could use some improvements. Manager support is not the best--"
good,Organize existing projects and initiate schedule for trainings and new  challenges. Team participation in follow-ups and persistent communication with third party.  Completion of goals and creating defining moments.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"It's and ok to work!!!! good people to work with,job can be hard at times but its all in days work.Many different cultures of people to work with but interesting."
good,Clean environment comfortable place to work and become adapted too but cant expect to be hired
good,"I had a great group of people to work with, both in the office and out in the field. I enjoyed the interaction with my customers. Was able to expand my skills while I worked. The company had great health insurance."
good,"In this corporate environment, it can be difficult to gain support for innovation. Management is more accepting of baby steps and yes-men/women. Career development is mostly placed on the shoulders of employees. Select few managers know how to, or attempt to, help their staff network, identify strengths, and develop career paths. Pay appears to be about 70% of market value, but Austin is a tough biotech market. For women hoping to move up the ranks into leadership roles it can be especially difficult; mgmt historically is majority male. Roles filled by internally-developed candidates favor don't-rock-the-boat style. Co-workers are hard working, especially in the context of the pay/development ceiling they face."
good,"A very friendly place to work, although communication between departments needs to be improved."
good,low compensation; do not replace employees when someone leaves just redistributes work
good,"-Life Tech was recently bought out by Thermo Fisher. With this acquisition, there is some job instability."
good,"Typical work day consist of figuring out which room you were to work in and for what client. Once paper work was read, you would then follow instructions that the client provided to fulfill there order requirements such as certain ways of packaging and handling their drug product. I learned to use certain machines for blistering strips and bottle filling. The hardest part of the job was waking up at 5AM. The most enjoyable part were the people."
good,"I am the only technician that has been cross trained in every department at this facility. I will help out in any area that is currently needing more assistance. I also will train new and existing employs in new processes. Another part i play is in equipment development and Preventative maintenance. I enjoy working on equipment and developing new ideas to interface into existing products, along with designing new products.   "
good,enjoyed my time here but advancement is virtually zero in my department. gained levey 3 inspection experience.
good,Flip Flop on strategic direction; not a lot of resources to enable success.
good,"People are great to work with. Tuition is paid, but very little chance for advancement. Too much management"
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,consistently coming to market last with products to chip away at competitors huge market share.
good,Work at LT many years. Good decent job for good pay. But morale is low due to frequent layoffs.
good,"Overall good company and employee benefits. Faced paced, sometimes stressful enviroment."
good,Long work ay full of walking and picking products. Option between an half hour lunch or an hour. Questionable managment structure.
good,The company has largely grown through acquisition and is attempting to create a stronger culture and identity for employees to align with.
good,Skills as a Project Manager.
good,"I began as a clerical temp for 1yr and 4 mos. I started being trained in the Int'l Customer Service Dept., Warranties and Parts. I was hired permanently and worked there for another year and 4 months, learning the actual equipment we manufactured. I expanded into Canada, Gov't sales and all overseas customers. There was a lot of work involved from beginning to end but gave me a new experience I had never worked in."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Interesting place to work at. Great colleagues and projects. This is a huge company and not everyone knows what's happening somewhere else. Huge differences between divisions. If leadership isn't present at location, one might feel out of the loop. As any other big companies, at the end of the day, the business decisions made can have an impact on your position and there is nothing you can do about it."
good,It was a great job in the beginning. I had a great job attitude and atmosphere and insurance.  After a few years at the job things started top change and insurance didn't cover as much and we didn't have job security from week to week.
good,"Company needs to invest more in their employees, less in their stockholders. Record breaking revenue reached but raises are very small. Hard work not always appreciared."
good,"No comment. Start with daily routinue check on building and equipemnt. Followed by tier meeting and dept. meeting which occupy half of the day."
good,"Thermo Fisher was a fun place to work, everyone was very friendly a outgoing. The work atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed, everyone made each other feel welcomed."
good,Per il tempo in cui ho lavorato in Thermo Fisher ho vissuto un periodo di serenità economica e ho raggiunto un buon livello di conoscenze professionali.
good,"I worked at Thermo Fisher Scientific for more than 3 years"
good,There is alot of mandatory overtime they do not tell you about upon hire and work hours fluctuate with no notice. The 7th day in a row is double time. So money can be good you just have no life.
good,Not great culture. But cannot complain. Management not great on other teams. They can be stop us from being a great company. There are better careers. Maybe in another part of the company.
good,"azienda in grande espansione,ambiente molto buono (colleghi) ma metodo lavorativo molto discutibile"
good,"If you want to make a career then this is a good company to work for."
good,I think that with better management of the place it would be brilliant to work there but for me it was the ppl that I worked with that made it a good place to go to work just feel on my part let down by management or I think I'd still be working there now do miss it tho
good,"many opportunities to grow. great team, good advisors on preparing me for my future. The turn around time for the company was fast. Management needed some more working on communication skills with employees"
good,Thermo Fisher Scientific is a good place to work. There are a lot of opportunities to grow your career.  I work for the company for 15 + years and maintained several roles within the company.
good,"Enjoyed working there. Unfortunately, due to Brexit and the way our business was structured, it was necessary to lay of some staff via Redundancy. But as a multi national corporation specialising in Clinical Trials, what I did there on a day to day basis was life saving and enhancing."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Data entry of all incoming orders and customer service for all incoming calls"
good,"This really is your average warehouse job. It's not hard work. You do your job then go home. Corporate doesn't seem to be on the same page as the warehouse, which does get frustrating at times."
good,The job was not hard at all. Keeping the warehouse stocked from new shipments staying prepared for the filling of orders to be picked and shipped off to another location.
good,Thermo-Fisher is a great company but is getting so big that there is confusion with the customer on who to go to for what.  There are great benefits and competitive salary but work/life balance is not good if you want to reach your goals set for you in your position.
good,"Great place to work. You just have to stay positive and diligent doing task. The employees are not eager to assist or help out, unless they know you personally. Management is kind of chaotic but will seek to resolve issues when you address them."
good,Very average company. Very average management. Very average operations.  Despite being very average they will have high expectations from you. You'll be held accountable for their very average management and operations.
good,Needs to improve as a team at the site a bit.  They have great team speak but lacks the true actions to back it up.  I do enjoy working with the team on the floor as we work and achieve the goals put forth by the company.  The team work is what I love!
good,They gave me a chance to work in a warehouse and taught me how to drive a forklift. They so me how to work smarter and to be productive. I thank this company for the job opportunity.
good,"Overtime is necessary sometimes but not too bad. The job itself is easy. The people are regular folks, not a lot of drama. My immediate supervior is cool."
good,"I loved working there, agency were treat exactly the same as others, good wage, plenty of overtime the only problem was a trainer who if she didnt like you you were out. Managed listened to her even if a lot of people had your back. I thought I was about to get my full time contra but turned out I was getting sacked for no real reason at all. Spoke to agency and was told that this trainer had a few people sacked even though there work was perfectly adequate"
good,The position was too technical for me so I was not happy there. The commute was great from where I lived but the job description vs the actual job were very different.
good,good work life balance. Good compensation.  Good people very busy work growing fast.  lots of opportunities to grow.  free coffee. Could use better training program.
good,"stressful, environment. I learned a lot work there. management was dysfunctional to work for. work days where long and tiring. need to have a very thick skin."
good,"The Process Instruments Division is a unit that was once comprised of 17 different instrument and process analyzer companies. "
good,"i started in the original warehouse position as a temp picking orders and wrapping and staging pallets. Ended in their new warehouse where I received my fork truck licensing,"
good,"Leuk bedrijf en erg naar mijn zin gehad. Toen ik er pas werkte kreeg je gratis eten van de beren of new york pizza. Dit is later wel afgeschaft ivm besparingen. Verder hing er een leuke werksfeer en was er af en toe ruimte voor een praatje."
good,Overall excellent work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to work as an individual and on a effective team and ongoing training.
good,"I worked through Mancan job service and benefits were very poor. Liked my job but to many co-workers criticized my work. Most co-workers were very helpful, but there always has to be a few that voice there opinion. No disrespect but I am 60yrs old and have done production for 20+ yrs and would have liked just doing my job, but there seems to be a lot of favoritism in the work place that keeps people from doing there work. I am a hard worker and always have been,so I don't have time or patience to put up with there silly games!!!!"
good,You're always doing something. There is always something to do between production or delivering parts you're never not busy. Material Handlers get paid less than what everyone else does and that is one of the worst parts of being a material handler.
good,"Good company to learn new technologies."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"I would clock in a few minutes early everyday, set up the machine, start running one order then set up for the next job. My  job title there was a printer. My quota was 18k microscope slides per day, and I would complete between 18-20k. "
good,"Did an internship. Was fairly unorganized. Manager was just a scientist there, not really a equipped experience-wise to guide an intern. They were also learning on the job seemingly. Intern program ended after 2 summers basically."
good,"For the first time that I ever worked at a scientific lab, I learned how to stopper vials in a quick and efficient manner. I also learned how to fill vials for urinalysis, HIV/AIDS kits for the medical field. Package sterile cotton swabs for the hospitals."
good,Nice opportunity with benefits.  The turn over ratio is bad but the work is plentiful.  Management is off just trying to rule with an iron fist going against what's right
good,Be willing and capable of adjusting to constant changes and goals. People management can be difficult depending on the people you work with. You are allowed to grow within your role if you chose to.
good,"I think that there was a bad culture at thermo fisher. The employees that I worked with were amazing, however the management were not very kind. I think that they have a long ways to go in improvement in that sector."
good,"outdated system , also the management of customer service. short staff in department. no room to grow. the coworkers were great. fast pace environment."
good,"A great company but in my department it was : "
good,"It appears Thermofisher uses a temporary workforce for many of its operations.  They hire some persons, but few; probably only enough to make it look as if they are providing permanent jobs."
good,"The job is a warehouse shipping job. It is quite stressful and there are a lot of issues that seem impossible to tackle because of how multi-faceted the processes are; too many hands in the pot. The pay is higher than average and you get plenty of hours. It is also interesting to work in a protein research facility. It is a relatively underdeveloped market so TF is very far ahead of the game in terms of sales and what types of products they need to be making. However, that does that reflect at all in the warehouse. There it seems like you don't get to experience that side of the industry."
good,"fast pace work environment, learn  new technologies,micromanagement,good coworker, dateline expectation were high,fun events,cook out,a lot of training."
good,"It was a good place to work, but would not offer permanent position. Almost all coworkers and supervisors were great. The work was challenging, but my supervisor was helpful."
good,"It was great working at Thermofisher as I learnt a lot about Life Sciences industry and some new and novel ways of measuring Customer satisfaction through NPS (Net Promoter Score)"
good,"I am a ""contingent"" or contract employee, brought in to get some projects moving and completed.  I am considered remote, working 2 weeks at home and 1 on site.  However, much of the work is done via Webex since people from all across the company may be involved in a particular project."
good,The best quality of the company are the employees in the lab and cubicles. Most are friendly and approachable despite the fact there are so many in the building.
good,"Bussiness>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Human"
good,Very busy department with strong sense of team work and everybody committed to producing quality product. Site is relatively small so every body knows each other
good,Thermo Fisher is a good company. Overall they have a good structure and good opportunity. I have been fortunate to learn and grow with this company for the past 4 years.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Always work hard. Team  always double. Check your work. Safety come first when operating the machine Never walk away from your machine while running  Always communicate, which is supervisor."
good,A great place to learn warehouse operations. Fisher was my start in the supply chain world and it was a great experience. I would recommend Fisher to a family member.
good,Its a OK place to work. Its a flexible environment depending on who your working. This job should only be a 5 year plan for new-comer. Layoff are out of the blue depending when consolidations happen.
good,"Peers were great very collaborative and great work environment"
good,The site is very fast paced.  A lot is always going on. The company is very large with lots of opportunity. The education development is better than most places I have seen.
good,"Thermo Fisher is too large a company to evaluate accurately."
good,"Fast-paced, highly-competitive. The science market is very diverse as are the products that the company offers, so the opportunity exists for great mental challenge and contribution towards making a true impact on society."
good,"Driven place for driven individuals.   HQ is located out of Mass.  Would prefer Chicago or California for myself."
good,A difficult place to work.  Lots of stress and pressure.  Very high turnover.  Lack of respect for the rank and file workers.  Some middle manager were actually terrible people.
good,"My time here was very brief. But I do remember it being a VERY demanding both physically and mentally because you had to constantly to move to pick items in a cold and hot room, and because you were picking medical and sometimes hazardous materials you had to be very careful and looking at the item numbers and locations. You also had to be very careful in how you would pack and ship them. The management was nice, but I was hired through a temp agency when I started and I do remember them having a very high turnover rate because if you didn't meet a certain quota in time they would let you go."
good,a lot of different people from all different cultures and backgrounds. Thermofisher acquires a lot of smaller companies but not a smooth transition. There is a lot of confusion between thermofisher culture and the previous companies culture. Individuals dont feel a part of thermofisher because it is so large. There is room for opportunity but you have to look for it and explore. you will be surprised how many companies fall under the thermofisher umbrella.
good,"good place to work, lots of work to do to pass your day, learned a lot from the work assigned and done, management is ok, diversed work place, mostly friendly employees"
good,"Very high stress environment due to outdated processes and tools. Senior management is moving in right direction, though. Each site is very different and operates like its own company, so each location is a different experience."
good,Was with Fisher Scientific when it was purchased by Thermo. Difficult  transition made better by communicative Human Resources team. Large company with many opportunities for advancement.
good,Thermo Fisher Scientific is constantly advancing and changing.  There is a fast paced environment all around.  Good job security if you perform as expected.
good,Nice company so far. challenging and high demanding. medium health v=care benefit and others. skilled and gives hands on to employees with SOP training. Salary still need to be improved.
good,Het was een korte tijdelijke functie. Ik hield mij voornamelijk bezig met administratieve ondersteuning.
good,This is the same review I've written three times. TFS is a good company. Advancement can be difficult. I recommend going into PPI to advance your career
good,"Thermo is a great company, it's also big. Advancement is related to performance as well as who you know. Recommend taking an interest in PPI at the onset."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Learned a lot. Good but hard manager.  Bad overall company. They had frequent mass layoffs that always made people afraid.  Good as a learning place.  Not for a long time.
good,"While working here learnt so many thing about medical equipments and their sales formalities. Learnt SAP's advance version, helped me to update my coordination skills."
good,"A fairly good environment to work and grow. Can improve on Salary and other benefits front."
good,My team and I had to deal with a lot of issues from the move. The move being thermo fisher buying a small company and the people who were part of the small company didn't come to thermo fisher so it was a mess. Lots of things were missing and not done. Pay was great. People are friendly. They offer good cafeteria food and drinks. Loved the salad and soup bar.
good,Nice people but very hot in summer time and cold in winter good benefits very good place to work and secure they have a lot of overtime if you like to work
good,"Nice place to wokr, there is a lot of pressure but, if you are a multitasking person you will accomplish any task. You can work one day from home. There are a lot of emails to respond. I need to be in contact with others departments and that is the hardest part of the job the communication between departments"
good,Fast-paced high-tech manufacturing environment which provided many challenges and opportunities to learn and grow professionally.  Hard-working culture which strove to meet production/sales goals and celebrated met targets.
good,"It's just a thankless job for a company run by folks who ""save"" money by outsourcing jobs while they sit pretty and can't even face those who they let go."
good,a typical day of work would be to pack and shrink-wrap pharmaceutical items. I learned how to keep my hands sterilized at all times. how to use my own initiative very well and to be able to operate different m achiness at on. the job was hard at times because I enjoyed it.
good,"It is a job like any other you have your good days and your bad days. You don't go to work expecting it to be anything but work. It is like any other worldwide corporation, you are just a number."
good,Great Entry level position. There is usually a decent amount of turnover. Management changes a lot and always seems to be some sort of restructuring going on.
good,"Great colleagues to work with in the Houston office.  Office one hour each way travel.  ThermoFisher internal processes cumbersome. Wonderful Marcomm personnel in Pittsburg. "
good,Co-workers are helpful and nice. Management is ineffective and absent from day to day life. Day is 6:45-2:45 with a 45 minute lunch. No other breaks.
good,"Depending on your management depends on your ability to succeed with this employer. They provide education reimbursement, but that does not guarantee you can move up the ladder."
good,Great place for people who don't want or need job security. Most decisions are based on shareholder value so many jobs go offshore to reduce labor costs.
good,"The company is an OK company to work for.  However, they have unorganized people in powerful positions and do not have any good processes put in place in order to deliver new technology."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,I advanced at this job quickly. It is strict on a set schedule. Mostly fast paced and always something new to learn. Mostly friendly staff and managers.
good,my resume must have been pasted in wrong because you are wasting my time with these reviews judging the same company multiple times so maybe you sho8uld quit
good,"great people, very poor documentation control. Vast product variety, constant product change-overs. New projects have cumbersome hurdles thru the approval process."
good,"Packaging and Assembly kits."
good,I learned a lot and meet great people! I think it's a great company to work for and to start a career. Thankful for all the experience I gained from working there.
good,"The silo approach between groups and divisions impedes Thermo Fisher's ability to be successful in the long run. The HR function that drives salary, promotions is relatively ineffective.  It is a nice place to work in that people and culture is positive but there is no sense of urgency or accountability.  They don't get things done - there is no corporate strategy on where the company is headed."
good,I enjoy the ability to interact with coworkers from around the world and learn from their experiences.  It is a good way to advance my knowledge in the regulatory field.
good,A typical day involved conducting productions and reviewing results as well as logging data. I learned how safely and effectively work with hazardous chemicals. The management was fairly good. I enjoyed working with co-workers. I enjoyed the science and processes. The hardest part was the lack of competitive wages especially considering the hazards of the job.
good,A typical day at work is going in at 8am.  Sitting in a lot of meetings.  Then more meetings.  Then getting work assignments that were not expected with no more time or resources to get them done..  Working overtime to try to meet the deadlines.  Then getting a low merit increase.
good,Can be stressful but people are nice but need to understand process and culture. Fast pace and training can be hard and let alone but it helps to just jump in and do things right away
good,"Great people to work with, many various opportunities around the world. Typically good support for personal development, and benefits are quite good."
good,"I liked the work environment, structured extremely well and a lot of freedom to perform your Job. Left because internship was expired."
good,Thermo provided me with growth and advancement possibilities.   I am grateful for the jobs I achieved with positive role models for advancement
good,"Great work involvement when not dealing with micromanagement from distant home office.   Hardest part of job was dealing with unnecessary make work projects.  Great co-workers, some of whom I had worked with for over 20 years. I learned how to successfully interact with a wide range of personalities from diverse backgrounds, how to plan for many different types of products with many different lead times and storage requirements.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was tasked with something requiring creativity."
good,"I like working in this company because there is so much to learn, which I value highly. The work is worthwhile because the products help fight cancer and other diseases."
good,"Too much of a corporate, and it's more of connection and favoritism for promotion and not in terms of specific performance."
good,"Mes journées sont bien chargées :"
good,"The office I worked in is no longer there.  I don't think they are in business any more anywhere."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Thermo Fisher is an interesting company to work with but they didn't have much regard for moving forward with new technology.
good,Nice environment to work in. Not to far from where I live I have learn so much in a year that I can use in the future. The typical day is very busy and fast pace. The workers there seem to be very friendly.
good,Enjoyed working with co-workers and the team efforts. This is a large company with many employees and therefore has its fair share of politics.
good,I only worked there a year in between jobs and could not afford to maintain 2 households.  Upper management was constantly changing and not offering stability.
good,"I learned how to do inventory, and how to stock product in the right allocated area's. The co-workers were great at getting along with each other, and working with each other. The management was good at helping us when we needed their assistance, and the best part about the job was that we would all eat together at lunch time like a family, including all office personnel."
good,"My day is pretty hectic due to the sheer numbers of projects that I handle. Daily issues have to be resolved for more than 20 projects that I work on of which 14 I manage alone and others manage with other project managers. There are constant issues that need to be solved in order for me to satisfy client needs, orders, and requests. Managing staffing for all the client needs is an integral part of what I do everyday. I have to communicate with other cross-functional group to make sure we all are on the same page; quality, IT, operations, production, repository, executives, and other client services personnel. The hardest part of the job is always making sure clients are happy. Clients have patients depending on us to deliver their life saving drugs or critical testing kits. We have to make sure they are released on short notices, shipped overnight across the borders or even oceans and satisfy all special needs the client might have. I enjoy working due to knowing that my work leads to someone being treated."
good,"•	Oversee quoting and order processing for all instrument orders in North America."
good,Not much innovation and if someone try to shake things a bit (s)he'll get in trouble. OK place to work if you just want to have a job.
good,"- large multi-national company"
good,"Thermofisher over took Life technologies, which was a great company to work for. Very hardworking managers and give tons of responsibilities to the subordinates"
good,"TMO is a great company to work for if you do not have any career aspirations. The career growth is limited to Directors and above. Also, very ""regional"" based focus, most of the roles are at headquarters."
good,"this was a very helpful company to the world, with providing safe medical equipment around the world.  it was a great work environment, wouldn't  mind working there again."
good,If your contract employee they decide at the last minute when to update you contract.  Employees are nice and offer help when needed.
good,Responsible and point of contact from the Mechanical Engineering side for Product Development for a group of next generation process instrument.
good,Servive on Thermo branded GC and GCMS.  Service on a variety of multivendor equipment at various  sites in the Northeast. Stationed at Pharma sites as well as field service
good,"Productivity is high, and work is very stress.  Management is quite selfish, and they are only concern about their own bonus."
good,Management was going through corporate reorganizations and were very verge in providing work direction. Offered little to no mentor ship and guidance. In 26+ years never work in such an stressful environment.
good,"Great Job Work/Life Balance"
good,Nice place to work for people graduating from undergraduate degree.  To start off their career in the biotech field.  You will meet diverse people to work.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"La matinee uniquement faite pour la saisie des commandes"
good,"Although it is a big big company the pay scale at this place is very low. one would think that if the company is doing so well they would treat their employees well, but it is only the upper management that gets treated like heroes while all the work done is by the lower management. Even after working so hard, you nothing in appreciation. If you get an interview, say no.. unless they say they give you a good package. Negotiate. You are worth more than what they say."
good,"• oversee the team’s day-to-day manufacturing operations and direct and/or cross train full-time and temporary personnel. "
good,"The Manager does not hover over you as you work."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of reviewing, drafting, and/or negotiating multiple contracts. Via work on Federal contracts, I learned more in-depth knowledge of the FAR. There was consistent turn-over in Management. I had 4 bosses during my time there. My Co-worker's were the best I had ever worked with. They looked to me as the Senior leader of the team and we pulled together to make sure that we under-promised and over-delivered. The hardest part of the job was having to say goodbye to my co-workers as they were let go. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work itself. As a self-described nerd, I love to read and having law school experience, I love to negotiate. This is what I loved the most about my job."
good,A good construction company having own design For Tank and BOP for power plant
good,I loved my job and I loved all my employees. I was released from my duties because I missed the shipping date of a case of medication.
good,management more concerned with there bonus and wallets then providing an even player work environment for all there employees
good,"production"
good,"When I worked there I was content with my job, but had difficulty establishing rapport with my manager. I would have liked to have had true dialogue given an opportunity to demonstrate my analytics expertise as applied to corporate content, but instead, there was a form that we filled out together in the beginning and that was it, very little communication beyond that. No more discussion about how the dialogue would apply to given projects or circumstances. The worksite was a dream complete with a scenic campus with wildlife and opportunities for nature walks on breaks and promotion of a healthy lifestyle. I would have liked to have found my niche to grow and thrive in, but most content was guarded. The hardest part of the job was getting my boss to talk to me and get to work collaboratively."
good,Customers are the main focus...Every day has its own schedule based on customer needs
good,"Decent place to work, like all jobs has it pros and cons. I enjoy working with my fellow asseblers on the line."
good,"I liked working here for the flexible hours, but management was persistently negative. Coworkers are great and train you well though."
good,You learn a lot of things. You work with different people.The hours where good. All in all it was a good company
good,"A typical day included picking, pulling, and packing orders in a cold storage facility. The best part about the job was the competitiveness and incentives."
good,Pulling orders and shipping by different carriers working too hard all shift.
good,"Over all I have enjoyed my time with the Company and have learned a great deal. As the company grew, the day to day tasks increased with the workforce remaining the same.  "
good,High through put fats paced Life Sciences organization on the cutting edge of diagnostics and pharmaceutical support.
good,"Thermo Fisher was a company that produced furniture for K-12 and universities. My job was to obtain quotes for special parts, ordering steel-tubing-hardware-fixtures and plumbing items. I also maintained minimum balances for stock parts and tried to reuse excess and obsolete parts. "
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Overall a good company to work for, the pay bands are not that great for the responsibilities that are required."
good,"Arriving at the always punctual at 5:30 company, I took a coffee with fellow ls production area and other areas. After preparing my station according to the electrodes assigned to me for analysis. These tests were performed as physical chemical tests to determine the success of those that meet the quality requirements."
good,"Typical day - Start at 6:30 AM with one break in morning, lunch and a break in the afternoon."
good,Typically you work your shifts depending what shift that you're scheduled and it may change depending on what machine you're on. Most of the co-workers are willing to help. However if you decide that you don't like to do the same thing over perhaps this isn't the right job you'd like. Also there are mandatory weekends and if you want a Saturday or Sunday off you need to use one of your vacation days.
good,ThermoFisher is a company that operates in a unique industry.
good,"manufacturing environment has a lot of sudden issues who you as a person in charge should take care of them Fast,Effective with low cost solutions."
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is a decent place to work. They have a decent benefits package (although it has decreased over the last 4 years), the pay is decent, but they use the facilities in low income areas as a way to decrease their base pay and wages. It's a decent/steady job (my father has worked here for over 35 years) but too much work-place politics. The lower level employees are great co-workers and fantastic ordinary people."
good,ThermoFisher Scientific is a large organization which has many smaller units across the U.S. Good company to work for and the jobs are stable. The growth opputunities are limited within the organization.
good,Very HS environment and job was very tedious.  Hands were blistered daily and coworkers were not the best.
good,This is a very competitive corporate agency that requires employees to be independent and self starters.
good,Great for anyone starting out to get experience in the biotech industry. Very little development/growth.
good,Morning stand-up meetings often leading them yourself. On to putting together my optic assemblies. The management wanted everything staged as a process. A lot of time was wasted and really slowed things down. We got some free lunches because of it.
good,a lot of paid time off is the only real pro here. con is that time off is micromanaged because of production needs.
good,"I worked here for 5 years and enjoyed each year. I initially started off on 1st shift as a chemical packager, packaging hazardous and non-hazardous chemicals. After 3 years I decided to work 3rd shift to attend school and seek a better future. My co-workers were pleasant and were very supportive in my transition; which was the hardest part of the job. I would never forget the support I was given to eventually set out a new path."
good,One shift and you stay til the work is done which can lead to some very long days.
good,Interesting opportunity to sell technical laboratory services into the Fisher Scientific Major Accounts. Developed service sales experience in a new industry working with accounts like Merck.
good,"Working for Life Technologies and Applied Biosystems means working in a culture that is innovative, dynamic and diverse.  The many products and instruments allows a proactive employee the opportunity to develop his/her career in different directions and different careers."
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific doesn't run as one big company, so each area is different.  I have enjoyed the work/life balance, and the benefits, but the company as a whole seem to cut employee relation/building/training when things are not going well.  There is alot of turnover here"
good,"Every day is a new challenge, which keeps me on toes, hence exploring my skills and expertise to achieve desired results."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,This was my first job out of college so it allowed me to see the professional business setting.
good,"In general, the people are nice, but the job is mundanewith little chance of progression. Mangament attempts to plasica the employees by telling them what they want to hear without follow through. Underpaid compared to local bussinesses of the same type by 20%."
good,1. A typical day at work would be rising in all challenges and knowing that you do all your best to minimize the risk of people's life working in Constructions hazardous life.
good,"The people were great to work with but a lot of management issues and a lot of day to day problems with shipping, receiving and pretty much top to bottom problems."
good,"Review production schedules and assure that all components are available for production, review backorders and assure that all backorders with available inventory are filled and address the root cause. If truly a backorder determine the earliest availability date and inform customer service."
good,"The environment at Fisher Scientific wasn't negative, however it was a feeling of just being a number and not a valued employee. I worked with a great team of other sales coordinators and sales representatives."
good,High pressure and high volume customer service call center. Client base consist of Science related businesses.
good,People are friendly. The company encourages learning and personal growth and gives employees the opportunity to learn new skills.
good,"Good environment to work in that is fast pace, but at the same time allows you the opportunity to think outside the box to increase better output."
good,"Looking after a small team of four Sales Managers. An extremely busy department, booking travel and arranging meetings, typing of visit reports, downloading monthly figures from SAP onto an excel spreadsheet, typing of Technical complaint letters, post, filing etc. The hardest part of my job is making sure everyone is looked after equally. I enjoy all aspects of the role and have an excellent working relationship with my colleagues."
good,"The company has helped improve medicine as well as helped keep customers hydrated and energized. Working for Thermo Fisher Scientific is an experience like no other. You truly get to see how a product is created, the processes that the product must go through before going to the customers."
good,Excellent place to start learning how the working world operates. Can have very slow days or high paced days but nothing too strenuous. Has potential to have order.
good,"Doordat ik mede verantwoordelijk was voor de maandafsluiting is het elke maand een uitdaging om alle facturen op tijd ingeboekt te hebben en uit te betalen aan onze intercompanies. Minimaal moet je de 2 deadlines in de maand halen. Ik kon zelfstandig mijn werk indelen, was flexibel en kon thuiswerken. Ook moet je communiceren met andere afdelingen / collega's in en buiten NL om bijv een probleem op te lossen. Dat is het uitdagende in mijn werkzaamheden. Het levert ook stress op omdat de werkdruk soms niet toelaat alles op tijd op te lossen. We hebben veel E-trainingen waar je aan deel kan en moet nemen. De kans om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen krijg je altijd, maar wel in overleg met de manager."
good,Like any workplace it has it's good and bad. Good was the on your own work where you were by yourself not feeling micromanaged and able to have confidence in your work. The bad was the miscommunication which lead to disputes.
good,Working for ThermoFisher isn't for the faint of heart!  Work-life balance is pretty much none existent.  I worked for Workspend and TMO was their client.
good,"For a pharmacutical supply company, it's a pretty good job. Must be able to work with extreme cold. Much of the packaging requires working on dry ice all day. "
good,Team members work very well with each other and support each other more than the managers. You must be a brown noser in order to get anywhere in the company. Very stressful
good,I was through Kelly Services in December of 2017. The job wasn't bad. People were pretty friendly. Great amount of overtime. Manager on 3rds I didn't like. He had too much attitude and didn't approach others well. The job itself was great. I found myself moving from packaging to inside the clean room inspecting the products.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Good work life balance and lots of staff benefits, but the company culture chases numbers without truly caring about the true impact on the shop floor"
good,"Productive workplace, with lot of obstacles for engineering/technical  work/upgrades and tricky paperwork, lot of hidden responsibilities, GMP documentation related supervision of people outside of the department and not subordinates."
good,"Great Benefits from day 1. Casual dress, lots of training, shift work so you must be willing to work any hours between 7am and 8pm. Lots of recognition"
good,"Thermo fisher is overall good company but still few things are need to improve like in this company learning opportunities is not that great. "
good,"coworkers were great supporting assets and management weren't as good as we needed. For example if you try to get to work right away when a job is completely set up for you you must likely will run into hiccups, and management couldn't help for they had no control over it. Note: I was on third shift all supporting assets were gone."
good,My co workers are the best I hate to leave them but my line is shut down do to lack of parts. I need to stay busy and have been helping in every department as a back up but I feel it is time to move on and feel more secure.
good,"When I was there, the HR Department was very strong and made sure the employees were provided their benefits per the employee handbook.  I enjoyed working there."
good,"- You can pretty much manage your own schedule"
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is one of the better jobs I've had. I worked at the Aiken Road site, and worked with some great people on my shift. My reason for leaving is to go back to school, and I don't want to work full-time and attend school full-time. I would come back here after school if I had to. MY main problem with working here is you work, ALL the time. You will work almost every Saturday, and have Sundays off, unless you volunteer to come in. The shifts are pretty long, but you get frequent breaks. I also worked 2nd shift here, which is from about 4:30 to 2 am."
good,Good work place management is provided good facilities.good learning opportunities.for fresher it's wonderful opportunity to work and grow. Your hard work will be appreciated.
good,The Management team were always overwhelmed with the amount of work as there were too many chefs and less cooks. The company very top heavy and make it a point to check employees morale everyday but no follow up.
good,"Management  is  poor  and  advancement  opportunities  were  rough."
good,"Productive and relax work environment. Quarterly lunch for the staff."
good,"Empresa con buena mision, pero con poca promocion real laboral para los trabajadores."
good,"Just needed a better sense of management and better training qualities. I was getting trained then the next day my trainer would be put somewhere else, now I didn't know what to do. Very unorganized."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Steady work for a 4 day week. Great job to enhance your Shipping/Receiving Skills. The management was dedicated to getting the work out in a timely manner. The hardest part of the Job was leaving.
good,The pace is fast. The hours are unpredictable and long at times.  The interaction between management and employees is strained at times due to lack of empathy for working conditions.
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is the world leader in serving science.  The nature of this business requires that we keep up with rapid market advancements and respond quickly to the changing needs of its customers.  My work is fast-paced and well suited to those with an entrepreneurial spirit.  I enjoy challenging work, an intellectually stimulating environment and share a common passion for making a difference."
good,You have to take your career in your hands. Management is very approachable and the company is very big so different opportunities to move around without having to leave the company
good,Great people but upper management has to get help to the groups that are drowning.  Plenty of opportunity to learn and grow if a person is motivated.  The knowledge base to draw from is huge and makes me keep coming back.
good,"Good opportunity to learn different areas from Commercial Finance to Operational Finance, Commission.  Very heavy work load.  Good management team previously."
good,"Great company, difficult to advance. Siloed but effective. Your best opportunity for advancement is to know as much as possible about each product and to make a point of going through the PPI process"
good,"The people that advance in the company are the ones that do the least amount of work, and socialize more. Fun work environment in the office, but it is very annoying if you want to actually do some work when nobody around you is doing anything."
good,Thermo Fisher has an atmosphere where favorites are picked and moved up and everyone else gets left behind. People step on each other to move up. I don't think that is good ethic.
good,"Management attempts to create a diverse workplace culture with emphasis on building good working relationships between co-workers. Workload is vastly different and not always fair; despite attempts to better the environment, it sometimes still has an ""every man for himself"" feel."
good,"Very nice work environment. Excellent staff and administration."
good,"no don't what to say...................................................................................................................................................."
good,Great place to gather valuable experience in the biotechnology industry. Great Team to work with. Feels like you are contributing to society by developing life-saving assays.
good,Normal Call Center Job. They have great benefits and generous vacation time but their Quality Monitoring process is overly critical and work/life balance is not that good.
good,"If you are looking for a permanent job with low pay, you are in the right place. this company provides secure job for you because it deals with medical plastic. However, it wasn't the place for me to go advance in my career."
good,"Il y a plusieurs avantages:"
good,thermo has a good work/life balance. but job security isnt there. no career growth. they have a good cafeteria . coworkers are friendly and easy to talk to .
good,"You order your job and you fill and finish it .good company"
good,It's a good place to work management not so good. You can tell your managements favorites and not all rules apply to everybody.
good,"I am a temp but I feel the company is lack of the communication and management. The pay is not good enough so people are leaving "
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Se preocupaban por el bienestar de los trabajadores y por la cohesión del grupo de trabajo. La empresa opina que un trabajador feliz es un trabajador productivo e implicado.
good,"Le travail était intéressant du point de vue relationnel avec les clients. La démonstration des appareils et la formation du personnel sur les machines d'analyses me faisaient plaisir."
good,"I really appreciate that the company allows flexibility in your workday and unlimited PTO. My co-workers are easy to work with, and I feel supported by team leads. "
good,Management is good. Fairly good policies. Work-life balance in finance is fairly good. Assessment process is transparent.
good,"Good company to gain exposure and learn about technology."
good,"Typical day at work is a bit boring in my role. I have done various trainings at this company. Management is good.My co-workers are great, probably the only reason I still work there. My job is not hard at all, however, can be dangerous health and safety wise."
good,Several opportunities for growth are available to does that weak it.  Promotions lead to unreasonable work load and noncompetitive salary.
good,The company has a culture of finding a work/life balance by working hard while you're there but go home at reasonable hours. Employees are not empowered to make decisions on their own without management approval which makes getting things done difficult.
good,Learned a lot of valuable things at this company and also some life lessons at this company sometimes its not what you know but whom this company does reward its employees in certain aspects
good,"I worked at PNC Bank for almost 12 years. They paid for my college education almost 100% and I learned a great deal about the banking industry.  After almost 12 years, I was eager to try something new.  A good company and I developed my professional and personal relationship there"
good,"There are so many great opportunities at ThermoFisher . .but it's because the business is so mismanaged.  Colleagues and management are good people, but their overall business acumen is low."
good,"It wasn't the right place for me, however could be good for someone who wants to get experience at a global corporation. Lots of resources."
good,"day to day role supervising the chamber department"
good,"10 hours work days"
good,"it's ok place to work, just some of the work sights are not that great some supervisors are not trustworthy.benefits are good."
good,"I enjoyed working for ThermoFisher, leaving only for personal reasons after several years of employment with good opportunities to advance. My department ended up as part of Thermo as the result of a series of acquisitions and the process of becoming part of a much larger company did result in a less ""casual"" environment but compensation like advancement opportunities and bonuses were good. In particular, managers made a real effort to help employees transfer positions rather than resort to layoffs (much harder in a small company with a smaller pool of positions)"
good,Company very big and getting bigger.  Re-org following acquisitions not good because years later everyone still not clear.  Seems to be lots of politics.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"It was always a busy day, but very productive for a company. Learned a lot about teamwork, how to work together and building a relation with work colleagues."
good,"THERMO is one of the leading MEP Contracting Company before global economic crisis was occurred. A lot of projects was closed when the crisis was reached in UAE particularly in Dubai. A lot of staffs have been terminated and tried to recover the company backlogs. But unfortunately, the company still continuously sinking due to mis-management by some high ranking officials."
good,I would answer email from engineers aroud the globe.I would contact customers about different issues depending where they were because of time zones. I would go to the lab and start the tech support instruments up and take measurments for different projects i might be doing.Attend meetings regarding customer problems with other departments and arrange more meetings if required.Speak to other members of the team to gather information that maybe i was not awere of. I would speak to the shop floor regulary to see if any procedures had changed causing failures in the field.The hardest part of the job was going to customer sites when there were problems with instrumentations and they were not happy with thermofisher.The best part of the job was fixing the problem and the customer patting me on the back with a smile then reporting this back to my manager.
good,"Big pharma on steroids. I you like a lot of scrutiny and to "
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is a good company to work for as I have never been without a project to work on."
good,"Different work weird hours, Weird hours, Bad management in the department i was in."
good,Processed and filled orders for customers. Satisfaction in knowing I helped change patients lives for the better. I work with a group of thoughtful and caring people.
good,"Co- worker are nice and helpful. lots of overtime,"
good,A single mistake could lead to harder shift the whole week at least. Full of politics amongst workers. Hard time working there. Thanks to God for giving me that job and also more thanks for taking it away.
good,"a lot of work. there is always something to do. too much to handle. operations has too many dead lines, management is awesome and really watches out for you"
good,"Good environment, busy management, not much opportunities of career growth."
good,My team worked well together.we enjoyed working with eachother and got along pretty well. It was a great pace most of the time .we did have some very slow times but others were fast and busy
good,The company is a nice place to work for. I have enjoyed it here. Its a good place to work for and to earn a decent living and provide for your family.
good,"Great to work and grow. But due to larger acquisition and merger,  the process are too complicated and non standardized. The cost cutting projects are increasing day by day and standards decrease day by day"
good,Overall the company is pretty demanding with their employees however they are very willing to provide training and give opportunities to build your skills and advance if you show initiative. This can also be very dependent on what group you are working in and how your manager is.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"- Ótimos benefícios "
good,"Pay is extremely low.  Overtime hours are basically unlimited, so you could make more if you wanted to spent 80 hours a week at work. They are flexible with working hours. Benefits are good. Culture is not good"
good,This is a stable job with good compensation.  There is a good balance between work life and home life so that you do not need to take your work life home after 5 pm.
good,It is a good job to start with but there are not a lot of advancement opportunities at the Eugene Thermo Fisher site. There are a lack of R and D positions available for advancements.
good,It is a place where team work is strong and the tools are given to succeed.  Unfortunately there is constant restructuring and changes to the teams.  Depending where you are located it requires a lot of traveling.
good,Aside from second shift hours the job was good and starting pay was also. could be a little stressful with tedious paperwork and high expectations. required quite a bit of training.
good,"Management always pushed employees to go out of their comfort zone to advance in company whether employees wanted to advance or not. Manager had temperament issues with some of employees, and played favoritism."
good,"Work 10 hours on average throughout weekdays. Worked 6-8 hours on Saturday. Productivity is key. Work long hours, daily. Work more, produce more, management is happy."
good,Inzet wordt gezien en gewaardeerd. Het wordt gestimuleerd om creatief te blijven en steeds weer te verbeteren. Het hoger management staat wel ver van het bij ons geproduceerde pharma product af.
good,"I loved working in IT at Thermo Fisher. With enough enthusiasm, you really can advance your career and have fun. I was able to create the justification for the job I wanted and got it!"
good,"Big company to explore more but need to be more structured and well integrated with acquired business. "
good,"Nice place to work, nice management. Have to work 1 year before any job changes can be made, such as moving to 1st shift. Must have good steel toe shoes."
good,"The site culture is not a changing one. "
good,"A typical day involves proceeding to either pick or pack orders unless shipments are received that need to be processed into the database.I started this job without forklift knowledge and acquired it here as well as a variety of trivia about medical supplies but aside from those two there's little chance for growth. Management has gotten better in the last few year but unfortunately seems to hire social groups as a group and those outside of said group will have a tough time fitting in, that being said if you do, you're set."
good,"This was a good place to work in terms of culture, however I felt a bit like I was thrown into the fire without much training to know what I was doing."
good,"Like all companies, Thermo Fisher is trying to gain market share and make a profit.  They are neither the best nor the worst at what they do."
good,Great learning experience.  Warehouse manager is great. Safety Conscious environment.
good,"Productive place to work where you learn everyday."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Thermo Fisher Scientific was a great internship for me over the summer. The pay was good for entry level and the hours were manageable. The people I worked with were nice and my manager was great! For people looking for higher up possitions Thermo Fisher has plently of opportunties avaliable.
good,"Installation, maintenance, repair and responding to incoming calls from customers about various issues with their analytical instrument systems."
good,"Great company, culture can be challenging depending on which site you are. Good benefits. Not a good work life balance. They invest a lot on talent employees"
good,"I liked my job, but they laid us off and I had to watch my co-workers die off as i was the last to be pink slipped. i had a bare minimum job with no advancement."
good,We started off doing exercises every morning at 5am. Then our supervisor and leads would address what needed to be done for the day. We all worked together on a team. Good place to work.
good,"Found good place to work. Currently working as packaging department. good learning opportunity and flexible hours. Good for overtime work. "
good,"Thermo Fisher is a great company to work for. Very relaxed environment, plenty of time off, ability to work from home, etc. Unfortunately, as well as the company does each year, they do NOT give pay raises. Ever. Also, no bonus opportunity."
good,I worked from home most of the time. My colleagues are well-trained and the best in the industry. The work was always challenging and rewarding. The work tapped into my technical background.
good,Manager of this company easily fires hard-working employees personally but he keeps bad workers personally. Company has to replace this manager immediately. Thanks
good,"TFS is a company where a hard worker can make a lot of money. They talk about work-life balance, but the reality is that to make the forecast goals, one must work hard and work a lot. But the payoff is big commission checks."
good,"Any company you work for is ultimately only as good as your manager and every company has all kinds of them. "
good,"Hi-Tech bedrijf met een groot potentieel."
good,Enjoyed working Thermo great research and products but needs better pay !!! Great group of people lots of super smart women but company needs more men in field
good,The company and people are overall enjoyable but when it comes to innovating and progression the company is a little to big for its own good. Depends on what division you end up in and who your manager/ boss will be as the quality varies between them greatly.
good,When I first stated to worked here was as Fisher SCI then Thermo bought Fisher and everything went down the hills. slowly but surely they started to take benefits away. I don't know how is now after 5 yrs but it was not good back then.
good,"I liked the job, the factory setting, and the people but I had a family crisis and had to be out of work for awhile .  Everything is better now and I'd like to explore my other choices ."
good,"Making sure microscope slides pass customer spec."
good,"I worked here as a contractor for about a year. Initially, my first manager told me the position was for me to perform some lab experiments in cell culturing and antigen purification. Instead, I was working on researching how to improve the current manufacturing processes and working for management. The responsibilities listed on the job description were not the same duties that I performed for this job. For the first three months, I was just learning as much as I can on my own with very little support; it's frustrating since most people were busy and there was no training and development for temps due to budgeting issues. There wasn't enough for me to do in terms of the lab work; it was mainly more office work than wet lab work. I was considering leaving about three months into the job due to little or lack of engagement from the employees and team, but management decides to change the direction of the team to do validation work. "
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific's corporate structure consists of roughly 800 different entities, foreign and domestic.  Their goal to double their market share was done almost exclusively through mergers and acquisitions.  Each time a new entity joined our company, the accounts would be mapped into our system, fixed assets, apportionment factors, as well as all of the subsidiaries of the acquired entities.  Frequently, these new companies would have a long history of State tax compliance issues.  So the tax compliance burden was expanding each year, as well as the administrative responsibilities, yet the tax staff shrunk to roughly half of its original size when I began in 2009 (Through employees leaving and/or retiring).  A restructuring closed our building in 2014 after a significant purchase of Life Technologies.  "
good,"I work in the R&D department and the work environment is amazing. Incredibly flexible schedule and fantastic co-workers. The work is fun and days go by fast. "
good,Muy bien agradable el ambiente
good,It was decent place to work. They provided decent Beni fits and salary. The building has high noice and requires to put the earplugs. I also believe there is good chance of advance in your position if your perform good.
good,"Thermofisher Scientific is one the good company to work at."
good,"Most people at my level must come thru a temp agency to be considered for permanent hire and work thru them for a year before being offered full time employment and benefits with ThermoFisher Scientific. I worked an exclusive job in the order entry department editing some 34,000 orders and working with several specialized order fulfillment systems, I had 2 of the best managers of my entire working career during my time there. They responded well to suggestions for improvements and took action to correct problems in real time.The workplace culture was dominantly pleasant and helpful, my team was very cooperative and agreeable to most changes. The hardest part of the job was learning to be proficient in a system that few others on my team used, but the support I needed was there for the asking. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it could be left behind at the end of the day."
good,Nice technology to work with and great people to work with. Emerging forward thinking and open discussion for sales activities. Really liked people who are on team
good,"Unfortunately, this company is so large that they have lost sight of the requirements to run a progressive company - investments are made in people but their hands are tied when it comes to taking things forward."
good,"Standard mon-fri job, felt like I was stuck and not much room for growth within location."
good,"Job production is very structured to meet supply and demand. Excellent blue print specifications in assembling products, Could be a more pleasurable atmosphere with different staff and management."
good,"Calm, slow paced work environment, great supervisors and friendly work place. Due to Thermo Fisher Scientific being such a large company, I find that the top brass don't really care about their workers. They take way too long to hire temps on permanently and don't pay enough for the work we do. I don't necessarily like the way they do things here but the environment makes up for that a bit in the sense that it's very comfortable and everyone here is friendly."
good,"Handle customer phone calls, deal with customer complaints,issue return authorizations for customer to send equipment in for service. Send out quotes for services rendered,collect payment and process customer orders for invoicing. Provide backup for other administrative task if needed."
good,"Global management of the water analysis portfolio."
good,Organize my agenda for the day.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Insense and Meaningful Company "
good,"Fast paced, multiple shifting priorities. Must be able to juggle. Projects can come from several divisions as well as corporate-level. Break fixes in current application software is also a common occurrence."
good,Bad work environment poor management. i am not going to write a full review. because this company put me in a freezer for 4 years and didn't let me out.
good,I spent many years of my career working at Thermo Fisher Scientific and the colleagues are very loyal and dedicated to meeting business objectives.  This was a fun place to work.
good,For the most part the day to day environment was great. However that was due to the wonderful team members. Management was biased and unrealistic in the goals that the understaffed group could reach which created massive overtime and stress. The benefits were great at Thermo . I learned several different departments because we all assisted each other due to short staffing. Overall I consider my time there to have been beneficial. I left there knowing so much more than what I came in with.
good,"I like what I do at Thermo Fisher Scientific, but I have worked as a Temporary employee for three years, and four months.  I apply at different opening when they  are available, but they will not hire me or fire me.  I am a good worker and team player and, I have good attendance.  They hire some people who haven't been there as long as myself.  I would like a chance.  Thank you."
good,"upper management only looks at production numbers, not the problems that are seen by the assemblers, all the problems are setbacks that are an inconvenience to their bonus."
good,"Competitive Product on open market."
good,"Employees are empowered to work to create the environment that they want.  There are challenges with the level of growth that Thermo Fisher has experienced, but Senior Leadership is doing a good job to address.  As a company Thermo Fisher does a good job of looking internally and driving for improvement."
good,"Working from home no office hours. my day at work was mainly checking and relying to daily emails, planning customer visits, working on sales plans, promoting the product. "
good,"Extremely busy work day. Took my finance, communication skills and confidence to another level working for a Global company."
good,"open the mail  and sort"
good,"*  Division between upper management and workers"
good,"Kit's Montieren"
good,"en los 7 años creci de Ingeniero de Manufactura a Gte. de Manufactura, con responsabilidades de inicio de 350 empleados y al final +600 empleados directos en la plantilla productiva, lo mas agradable fue evitar que la empresa cerrara y se fuera del pais a la India, esto se logro mejorando todos los indicadores de seguridad, calidad, clientes y financieron de manera exponencial."
good,"I definitely put 110% into both of the positions I held at Life Technologies. Though the hours were long, I enjoyed developing different strategies to work smarter not harder. I also learned to become much more efficient by understanding who on the team possessed which strengths, including myself, and building upon those. The hardest part of my most recent position was deciding which tasks to delegate and to whom, and the most enjoyable part was seeing those I had trained or influenced in one way or another, succeed."
good,"Many opportunities for advancement with the right supervisor. Fast paced environment, where the day goes by very quickly. Other employees very helpful."
good,People are quick to throw blame to someone else to avoid taking responsibility. Poor culture. They take liberties with SOP's and CGMP when needed. the Cincinnati site needs to be flushed.
good,"You get pulled in 2 different directions.  It's like a 2 edge sword.  One person tells you to do it this way, and the next tells you to do it another way.  It's not a bad company to work for, just need to have a uniformed way of training and doing the task at hand."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,A lack of a strong central culture contributes to a litany of complaints ranging from a disparity of resources to a lack of focus.  Attrition increasing as a result.
good,Can work 10 hour days six days a week. On occasion 7 days. Was getting more work life balance as time went by depending on where you worked. Compensation was improving as time went as well. Biggest issue was we went through 7 site leaders in my ten years with the company.
good,"Salary rates are not compatible with the market."
good,I worked on the line and also did several other activities. I would recommend to try and get a permanent position before going the the temp agency. That way you are not getting temp pay for doing the same if not more work then anyone that is permanent. Everyone is friendly for the most part. The hardest part is just when the rooms you work in are really hot.
good,"You are not rewarded for your hard work or education. Lack of advancement in the Atlanta location.  Jobs are given to ""friends"" within the department with less education or knowledge."
good,The job does not pay well in comparison with other pharmaceutical companies in the area. The management team is somewhat political. The job is about who they know and like more than the qualification of the employee.
good,Very busy job.  A lot of intercompany transactions.  The hardest part of this job was balancing getting your job done with the many meetings.  My Co-workers were very pleasant and helpful.  A typical day included posting between 30 and 50 accounts payable invoices and posting up to $8 million in accounts receivable receipts.
good,"Company is relatively stable, very finance driven, quarter to quarter, slow to adopt new technologies or embrace changes in a new digital world.  Slowly becoming GE like when it comes to older employees."
good,"Thermo is a good MEP company,they giving good &quality work"
good,"Thermofisher is a good company to work for. However in order to advance in this company you have to know someone to get ahead. My current department does not function like teams, but individuals out for themselves only. Some departments function like teams and have high spirits and make the company overall a good company."
good,"Good place to learn the business but not a lot of room for advancement without relocating to another state or country, I learned what I can and ready to move on to bigger and better things."
good,"I enjoyed my time there. It was hard work, long days, and little recognition."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, just didn't workout for me. I believe the job was well underpaid. There was however an excellent benefits package incl health insurance."
good,"So the training was rushed when I first started working there as they wanted me to start working immediately, there was a lot of wasted time in meetings and generally management being unhelpful. There were a lot of good people I worked with which made the job better, but at the end of the day management didn't treat any of the workers very well."
good,NA was there to long so my thoughts are not that many it's was easy work and it was getting to be more interesting but the contract ended so that was that..
good,"I loved TMO's result orientation. It is goal-oriented however can use more common sense and listen more to people who have great experience."
good,My experience there was good except for the management. I wanted to grow with the company but was never able to. I enjoyed my line of work and took my job seriously and was very dedicated to my job.
good,"Ok place took. Temps are treated like slaves by some full time employees behind management's back. Management is so busy that full time employees know the system well enough to sneak ""lost or damaged"" parts by without them being accounted for"
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Work balance is not very good at Thermo Fisher. The pay is good/fair. Support from management lacks due to their responsibilities being stretched thin
good,"The company has a strong mission and vision. However, they are often worried about the small savings versus the investments needed to further the company. Often ruled by new managers without much experience and inability to listen. Great place to learn but don't stay here too long - you'll get burned out and you won't be seen as promotable."
good,The majority of your shift you will be sitting at a desk in front of a computer. Less than a quarter of the shift will be spent patrolling the warehouse. You have to bring your own food or be prepared to pay for overpriced items in the cafeteria.
good,"Thermo besteht aus mehreren Subdivisionen. Zwar gibt es gerade bezüglich des Arbeitsverhältnisses und der Möglichkeiten und der konzerninternen Ethik übergeordnete Strukturen, die tatsächliche Erfahrung als Mitarbeiter, Arbeitskultur und die Vergütung hängen jedoch sehr stark von der jeweiligen Subdivision und u. U. vom eigenen Team ab. Mein allgemeiner Eindruck ist jedoch, dass Thermo Fisher Scientific eine möglichst harmonische und inklusive Arbeitskultur anstrebt. Das Unternehmen ist familienfreundlich und bietet seinen Mitarbeiteren gute Benefits und Möglichkeiten zur Weiterentwicklung. Die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den Divisionen ist stets von einem guten Klime begleitet."
good,Everyone for the most part was nice to work with. I was a temp there so I can't tell you much. I would have went full time there and was in the process of doing so when I was told by my staffing agency that they didn't need me anymore.
good,"Change is inevitable and I am very open to it but with the change of executive IT management brought a new culture which blames all of it's mistakes on the original employment base, and accepts only the rewards from the things that go right. Because of this mentality most of the work has shifted to the legacy teams because the new management and employees have very little incentive to work hard. "
good,"Stationary assembly line work."
good,"I had never worked with the SAP program, it was kind of hard to learn, co-workers were very nice to work with, my boss was an awesome person to work with. Then my job ended due to cutbacks."
good,Sales Director for Laboratory Products Group for Thermo Electron after the acquisition of Forma Scientific in 1996.  Converted Midwest Region form rep organizations and distributors to 7 direct territories calling on Life Science Research accounts.
good,"a typical day varies from being slow to fast paced at times. i was hired as a forklift driver , but there were never any avail forklifts for me to use , unless if someone called in to work. I was bouncing around from station to station to try to keep and look busy because the help wasn't really needed. I didn't enjoy the gossip, judging and there was allot of internal thefts which made it bad for everyone due to suspicion from management ."
good,It is a productive work place. Management is pretty hands on with their staff. A typical day at work starts with our daily morning meetings to go over everyone's tasks for the day.
good,"Learning organization that is rapidly changing. The revolving door of managers is cumbersome and detracts from field focus. A ""me too"" mix of products."
good,"Good to work in the organisation where we can balance little bit of work and personal life. It all depends on manager regarding the job profile, promotions."
good,"Internationale onderneming, zeer dynamisch, nooit saai!"
good,"they all good helper and I've learned so many important things."
good,You are assigned specific tasks and each day you are required to solve new technical and scientific puzzles which makes the job more fun.
good,"Working at Thermo Fisher Scientific opened my eyes to technology of keeping our world healthier and safer through the scientific research being done to improve our society. "
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Good number of established accounts limits the ammount of solicitation needed. Spent on average a week per month away from home. Decent ammount of tracking, logging, filling in reports as you would expect in a bigger company. Most of the job consists of answering phone calls/emails and organizing in person meeting for fairly quick sales calls."
good,"Repetitive work, everyday tasks make time go fast. Company acquires more accounts but puts little back into the company."
good,"Les journées sont chargées car la charge de travail est importante. Beaucoup de métriques à atteindre et à suivre."
good,"I sell chemistry controls and an online QC system to medical laboratories in hospitals in Texas and Louisiana, I travel 9-12 nights per month."
good,I was at the company for many years. I learned alot while being at the company which allowed me to work in various departments at the job site.
good,A good worldwide company with good benefits. Fast paced work environment. Employees are encouraged to advance themselves through higher education.
good,Staff is really good and supportive. management team welcomes you if you wish to learn something extra and put on extra efforts from their side for one's growth
good,"The work is hard and can be long at times, but the people more than make up for it. They treat each other like family and are very kind. We worked lots of weekends and there is always a chance to improve."
good,Fast paced day with great team atmosphere to tackle challenges not generally encountered in most warehouse settings.  Great opportunity to hone time management skills as well as broaden understanding to shipping in the context of meeting time sensitive needs to both customer and public health.  Team is close-knit and fun demonstrating the values that serve both employee and public alike.
good,"Nice people to work with, not alot of room for advancement. Did all of my work at a desk. People were very nice, not alot of motivation from co-workers looking to advance"
good,Thermofisher Scientific has a great starting pay rate compared to the work you end up doing. You are also able to transfer departments as well as shifts through their internal hiring.
good,This company is overall a great company to work for.  Great peers in a great working environment. Great team of managers who support there employees at all cost.
good,"It’s a great place for growth. I learned a lot at thermofisher and I believe In thriving, this place has taught me many things and I’m ready to expand else where."
good,"The innovative, creative environment fosters educating its employees to advance the company's mission to make the work a healthier, cleaner, safer place to live."
good,"The executive management was constantly changing procedures, processes and methodologies.  This caused issues meeting and setting goals as the target was constantly moving."
good,"fun work place,managers are respectful and talk friendly with employees."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Good experience.  Good people.  Lots to learn.  Ability to move up.  Very professional.  Formulators have ability to work as needed.  No hawkish bosses.
good,"You show up and do your job, try and work with the group that they put you with, depending on where they put you you might be working 6  10hr days or 40hrs a week."
good,"good place to work and good atmosphere, overall from leadership perspective and product perspective very good place to learn and apply ourself and also very professional."
good,When i left i left for more personal reasons than being unhappy with the work place. I would gladly go back to work for them if given the chance. I did get the opportunity to advance and would like to show them i was worth it.
good,Each business unit is different and will have a unique culture. Find out about the one you're interviewing for. Good benefits from overall company. I'd work there again.
good,The job there was great. Money was good the people were very nice. Clean and organized. Work hours were perfect. Company put in nice events and also gave a great bonus.
good,I worked for a branch of Thermo Fisher that had recently been acquired. The team I worked with was smart and well managed leading to a productive and fun work place environment but I cannot speak about the environment at the main office.
good,"It was a good job but when you're young and a great worker who is always being recognized, other people get jealous (women) and do vindictive things to you to cause you your job even if you have done nothing but been loyal to the company. Coming in on off day , coming in early , staying over late and overall just putting my all into my job because of the type of person I am!"
good,"A very niche industry - bioinformatics, good for former microbiologists, but not for your average programmer. Good working conditions, friendly fellow employees and management."
good,some jobs were harder than others but i actually really liked it here. the managers cared about their employees and it really showed. good benefits and great hours
good,"Thermofisher was a fun placed to work, I manage the workday for my director, two managers, and five supervisors within the customer service call center. I was responsible for creating thems for bulletin boards and displays, correspondence, approving invoices for payments, ordering offices, managing coffee supplies and equipment,  minutes for management meetings, decorate rooms for special events such as award ceremonies, anniversaries, birthday recognition's accommodated the department's meetings, created award certificates, order food for special events, purchased supplies, and many other office related duties"
good,I loved my job and my co worker was good. The job was challenging and rewarding.  I worked to get delivery out on time through via Fed Ex and UPS. I completed varies of Customer Service interviews.
good,"I was a contract technical writer, I mostly worked off-site. My job was almost entirely about rebranding their documentation, so a lot of grunt work. It was good for me, I appreciate the opportunity. The people I worked with were uniformly nice, helpful, and a few of them really good to work with.

I have to work on my toes to fix problems quickly, which I really enjoy but the remaining parts of the day involve tedious, mundane tasks. I would love to work more directly with customers instead of being glued to my phone/computer staring at excel spreadsheets."
good,"Good Diagnostics MNC company , Good Diagnostics products , reliable test"
good,"I worked here part-time but this was a full-time face paced environment. I enjoyed the staff and the environment and it was a wonderful learning experience. This was the first time that I worked as a PAC administrator and that pretty much was the hardest part of the job, learning the culture of politics as it pertains to gifts and funds being distributed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the same, I learned an entirely different facet of politics than I was previously exposed to and in was very intriguing. I also enjoyed the staff."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Great company, needs better leadership"
good,"Management is almost non-existent and the operators are usually the ones who are responsible for resolving issues.  Management is consistently finding other responsibilities for the operators to perform daily that takes them away from the production lines.  There are so many procedures, and the procedures are so disorganized that the operators are nearly setup to failure."
good,"My tenure has been really good here, made some real good friends, professional & hence your energies also get charged & enhanced. Traveled a lot & there by giving an insight of other people working environment. Challenging but again demanding so one can shape its career well."
good,I work four ten hours shifts. I have learned a lot of things about the biotech industry. The hardest part is being on your feet for so long but I'm getting used to it.
good,"I have been fortunate to work with an amazing group of people at LifeTech.  A typical day of work includes booking travel, troubleshooting customer technical issues, traveling to train customers and working with product managements to solve new product issues.  The hardest part of my current job is trying to decide who to say no to. There has recently been a drastic increase in territory size due to loss of team members and no instruction on what items to stop covering.  The best part of my job has been acting as a trusted technical adviser for clinicians and scientists, teaching the correct way to design and implement experiments."
good,It was an easy job to do because of everyone helping out. I learned how to assemble medical equipment. 
good,This job can be very stressful however Thermo Fisher is very good at their employees balancing work/life with our 9/80 program which is awesome to have every other Friday off.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I have satisfied the customer and they are happy and my customers keep coming back.
good,Life Technology is one of the largest genomics company in the world.
good,Thermofisher Scientific was a fast-paced manufacturing facility . I supervised in several different departments and several shifts over the years. I also worked as a production scheduler. I learned the value of teamwork across departments and support groups. My peers were driven and goal-oriented people who were great to work with.
good,"The lion's share of Cole-Parmer's (division of Thermo Fisher Scientific) business has been through the mailing of their main catalog and supplemental ""Featured Products"" brochures. Unfortunately, going to market via the internet is not one of the company's strengths; and the reason for that is the cost associated with PPC programs and other ""Customer Loyality"" promotions."
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is one of the Leading pharmaceutical industries in the United States. The main objective of Contract Sales System Data Mart is to support Sales Representatives with Physicians and Hospitals contract information. Sales, Marketing & Contract information was collected from different tests conducted on the subjects. Data mart helps build Monthly sales report for every Professional or Organization in contract"
good,"Detail-oriented professional with seven years of experience in the biotechnology industry. Motivated team player with exceptional work ethics. Thorough understanding of GLPs, GMPs, quality systems, cell culture techniques, good documentation practices, standard operating procedures, laboratory equipment validation and maintenance, laboratory information systems and sample management."
good,"Tough sell, but rewarding"
good,in austin tx
good,"Good place to work easy to get to."
good,Be willing to work the hours asked if you. If you can’t then I recommend looking for a job that requires a less strenuous schedule. Be sure your willing to show up or you won’t keep your job.
good,Working here was a good experience and I liked the job and the people that I worked with. The work load was sometimes overwhelming. It was a hard life balance.
good,"Very hard to gather all the information needed to do projects. Projects get recycled through the years because people leave and others forget what was done. Slow to make any changes and don't want to spend money on upgrades because it's contracting manufacturing. Other than that, the role was laid back and wasn't too demanding... just wasn't super fulfilling and you don't grow a lot in the position."
good,"Lavorando nel Service ogni giorno è differente, non c'è tempo per annoiarsi."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Management has a lot of room for improvement. This site was purchased 4 years ago by Thermo Fisher but the old culture is still alive and well. Very clicky and if you are not a favorite of your manager, you might struggle. I enjoyed working there because of the coworkers. Unfortunately,  I wouldn't make it work with my manager. I worked hard to get where I am in live and I'm not letting this place beat me down."
good,It is a good company to work for with good products. The company is too big and the most difficult part of it is dealing with all the internal issues of the business. A good place to get started in the Biotech industry.
good,"Not a bad place to work.  Contract manufacturing can be up and down.  High focus on PPI and cost cutting.  Pay is good, benefits are good as well.  Good work/life balance."
good,"I enjoyed my time there. All the staff are really friendly and helpful."
good,"I worked with an excellent team who were always willing to teach. "
good,"Nice facility, great co-workers, fairly typical contract assignment; used mostly my document formatting skills, plus PDF conversion, document tracking spreadsheets, etc."
good,"You learn a lot about customer service ."
good,Fellow employees are welcoming. A lot of older employees who have been there over 20 years.  In addition there are a lot of young employees who are getting paid a lot more than old timers. Changes to the way things are done are slow and without any assistance.
good,Great products and projects to work with. Good training programs and resources for performing job responsibilities.  Very corporate atmosphere but good co-workers.
good,"This is not a bad place to work the pay is not not on pace with similar jobs but not too far off and the benefits are good. Kind of the culture of a company much smaller than it actually is. It takes forever to get through the hiring process. I had a phone interview, personal interviews with three people all on different days, and an extensive background check. 2+ months later it was time for a week long on boarding"
good,"strong revenue source.  Management team could be stronger.  Had to deal with a lot of turnover in management.  More of an assembly plant, than a true medical facility, so it was treated a little different by corporate."
good,"I enjoyed working here even though I mainly cleaned. Everyone seems pretty down to earth but, you can tell that it’s a temp job by every sense of the word."
good,For the time I've worked at Thermo Fisher I can confidently say that everyone I talked to is really friendly and welcoming. Everyone is open to help each other if there is any problems or questions. At the beginning for me it was and is difficult because there is aloooot of information to pick up on. But that may have been because i hadn't as much working experience at the field unlike alot of people. They all work as a team even if you're not working with someone at the moment. That person will go out of their way to help you if needed.
good,"Leadership team changes too often and lack of continuity on long term strategies. But people are great to work with,  and good respectful and encouraging culture"
good,"It was much better working for here before our business unit was sold to Private Equity, Once the sale went through management had been rotated as were benefits."
good,"People are great, hours and work life balance is good, training is getting better.  Process changes are coming to improve effeciencies, plans to increase headcount due to business needs are coming."
good,"After I was hired, trained, and began doing my job (resolving customer problems at customer sites) the hiring system was 'rationalized' globally, and modified to require mentoring...so after actually working for almost a year, I had to go back to riding around with other Engineers.  I was then part of a nationwide ""Reduction In Force"" as part of an effort to improve overall profitability."
good,happy place to work enjoyed my 5 years till retired pay a little on the low side for the job management ok all ppe provided factory a little dated days are busy and go quick
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Thermo corporate is very focused on the corporate mission of making the world cleaner, healthier, and safer.  It is not just a slogan, but a day to day focus of management."
good,"I worked with amazing people every day. They were all experts in their field and we were working on ground-breaking products. I had great opportunities to learn and grow within the company."
good,Working for ThermoFisher was a very satisfying experience. The management was very understanding and considerate. I learned a lot from working here and gained a lot of valuable experience and skills.
good,"I liked my peers and what I did. My manager was responsible and reliable. I wasn't able to interact much with people from other departments or senior management, though."
good,"I liked the friendly, hard working people.  The company has experienced mgmt.and well focused organization.  A shuttle bus beween BART and the facility would improve commuter options."
good,You can learn a lot through work. Managuement is very low efficient. Work place culture is good. Hardest part is job switching too much. The most enjoyable is people there are friendly. Work environment is OK. Safty is very good. People friendly. Lot of cosmatic effort for the company merging effort.
good,"Worked on a one year contract. Supported numerous instruments as far as preventative maintenance, troubleshooting, and upgrades.  Worked in the engineering service group of about 15 peers and management.  Worked with electronics, robotics, chemicals, and pumps.  The team was great to work with and the training was great and management was supportive.  The best part of the job was it was a new challenge every day with plenty of support from the team.  The hardest part of the job was the handling of dangerous chemicals using the proper PPE."
good,The company is a decent company to work for. It is my belief that they are way too focused on profitability and not adequately investing in their new products or employees.
good,"Morning - Attend Tier meeting and go over issues encountered, brainstorm possible solutions and plans for the day ahead. Cooperative and team environment"
good,Great over all experience! Learn a lot & able to operate different types of machinery. Builds great characteristics. Fast paced. Challenging at some points
good,Shame they have announced the closure of the Ashford site at the end of 2019. This was a great place to earn money and work hard. Unfortunately the manufacturing base is being moved abroad.
good,"The location required that I leave home at least 2 hours prior to start. The ride home was often 3+ hours."
good,The Grand Island facility is a wonderful place to work the culture is very pleasant and the people are great. The only complaint I have is the organization has grown faster than the systems that support it which can be challenging.
good,"The mission and what we do is phenomenal. "
good,"People follow rule # 1- work safely (hazardous chemicals), most employees keep to them self and you can do a lot of overtime. Union shop, so they follow the book, all the time."
good,I was a contract worker not an employee of the company. It appeared to me it was a good place to work for.
good,"This facility was in a unique position in servicing the environmental and pharmaceutical industries which had very unique differences in their requirements. This allowed for a challenging and rewarding opportunity to meet their distinct requirements for both industries. All services and products were custom which provided me the opportunity to develop the process for each customers product based on their requirements. Also had the opportunity to host 20+ audits of our quality system on a yearly basis with customers and ISO auditors. "
good,great place to work and develop skills.  Enjoyed the people.  The hours were very long but the work was rewarding.  Growth opportunities were plentiful and the company was willing to provide training.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Working in the field for Thermo Fisher can be good or bad. It all depends on your manager. Some give you the respect as a professional and are hands off. Others are micro-managers with no field experience. Negotiate a good salary up front. Pay raises are poor. Advancement oppurtunities in your career are slim.
good,This was a great company but it was very fast paced and they expected a lot from their sales reps. Management was hit or miss but the sales force turns over very quickly.
good,"Finance is non stop, you are busy all the time, never a dull moment.  Month end is a full on week where you work several 12 hour shifts."
good,"I was a  temp here."
good,Es una empresa dedicada a la innovación de la salud y de crecimiento en las personas según sus aptitudes
good,this is a stepping stone company to pursue your career further. nothing long term. little recognition for work that you do. Management is great though
good,"I liked my work hours at this company, working 10 hours day from 7:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m Tuesday through Friday. We had a weak manager, not being honest to us."
good,"Our department is not mainstream products of Thermo Fisher."
good,"Es una empresa que esta creciendo actualmente, no tiene bien definidos varios detalles en cuestión de validaciones, documentación, ingeniería y calidad pero se esta fortaleciendo en eso."
good,"Engagement is high and the work life balance is good. Low stress job but low salary. Benefits are horrible. Not a lot of growth within the company, but potential for higher management."
good,Nice place to work and enjoyed working with all the groups from different locations with many people. Nice atmosphere but with less job security. Enjoyed my entire tenure.
good,"There are no OT culture in this company"
good,Worked with clients to solve problems.	Guide & mentor team members in accomplishment of business objectives.Lot of comradeship at workplace. Hardest part of the job when Some team member leaves for better opportunities. Most enjoyable part is getting lot of learning from customers.
good,Good place to work witrh friendly staff looking to advance employees within the company. Continuously changing to compete with competitors and find new avenues of revenues.
good,The company has a great life/work balance and you can work remotely. Schedules are flexible because of this. Fun company but could be more attentive in meeting career needs and goals.
good,The job was quite easy. The hours were long but the payoff was good being off Thursday-Sunday. I learned how to test AT&T equipment that customers would need for cable and the internet. The workplace was fun and demanding at times.
good,"I've learned to establish a working knowledge of our customer's needs, and elevate them to impact projects. Being so close to user data, I have a chance to understand out customers and design concepts to make our web experiences better."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Great global company setting pace to become the largest in its industry globally
good,Day to day operations were a combination of project management and sales duties.
good,"C'est une entreprise spécialisée dans le domaine médical avec un très bon esprit."
good,For the amount of time i worked there i gained a lot of knowledge about shipping/receiving as well as this is where i developed my management styles.
good,"A great company to work for, I learned how to work from home and how to travel internationally."
good,"The organization gave me the opportunity to hone and develop many skills.  While it may sound cliché, the company was in a pretty constant state of flux.  Life Technologies was built by acquisition and a desire to move into advanced Next Generation Sequencing.  Time will tell how this bet pays off, but the immediate consequence is the purchase by Thermo-Fisher and likely big changes in 2014."
good,"My day was full reviewing wood and steel manufactured parts and products.  I supervised up to 25 inspectors at one time which were stationed in the various areas of the company from incoming receiving to end product inspection and all areas in between."
good,"Each day at work would be exciting with lot of new challenges and our kitty. New projects, new learning, knowledge transfer and team work was all a part of a day. The co-workers were more of friends and  co-operative. Totally an exiting journey of four years."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Thermo Fisher Scientific. A lot to do, and not enough time to do it all... but I learned a lot"
good,overall great experience and nice and fast paced
good,"Being part of such a huge organisation has its pros in as much as there is much opportunity to work with colleagues across varying countries, cultures and backgrounds. On the other hand, however, you do wonder how your small contribution can make a difference! Watch out for workforce consolidations but seek to utilise the travel opportunities."
good,Life Technologies is a great company to work for especially for someone just beginning their career in the biotechnology industry. The outstanding leadership of the executives seem to meet all fiscal / financial goals of the company in every quarter as well as doing the necessary things to stay on the cutting edge of attaining newer or better technologies (e.g. the Ion Torrent technology).
good,"Working in production was usual production protocol. I liked learning all the new products that were implemented. The management was awesome when I first started, then there were some changes and it just went south. Moral went out the back door! The hardest part of the job was gowning up every day. The most enjoyable was interacting with all the employee's!"
good,Well educated and experienced employees. Good culture amongst employees. Reasonable work / life balance.
good,"It was a very nice working environment,"
good,"I was really happy with my job, but the lack of communication was quite disappointing"
good,Well organized workplace for the qualified and experienced people.
good,I would recommend Thermo Fisher Scientific as place to work.  The environment is open and welcoming. The building is secure and well maintained.  I was a contractor but they treated you as a employee. Training was excellent.
good,Very Intense environment at the time.  I liked the people I worked with but found the manager very frustrating as they had high demand of time with no investment of background on projects and treated contractors like they didn't  belong.
good,A very good place to work. People there are great to work with. Salary is very good. Management could be a little better. Some are not great with dealing with employees.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,.They had good work life and personal life balance as they had five day working facility. The working life is good and for my department the management is also good.
good,Thermo research and development in Bangalore is a cool workplace where day to day activities will be well planned. You will get a chance to work in different modules in antibody development.
good,Nice people and a very scientific learning place. Learned a lot about mass spectrometers. I want this review to be over. Now. I don't really have anything substantive to add.
good,Getting help back on the floor when uppity are a good worker and madrė to train new hitters who makes more than you and are given the position you were promised
good,Productive place to work.  This company does a good job of supporting the work-life balance initiative. The most enjoyable part of the job is collaboration between departments to deliver right the first time.
good,GOOD WORKING ENVIRONMENT TO GROW. good interpersonnel skills and freedom to work. training exposure to go ahead. very good factory support. need to improve on inventory.
good,Nice place to work. A bit of a distance from DC. Relaxed workplace. Everyone knew their role.  Management was not overbearing.  Coworkers in other departments cold be cold. Two head scratchers--nonworking soda machine never removed and two refrigerators always full.
good,Experiencing some growth pains but constantly seeking to improve and utilize our products and services to help make the world a better place. There are a lot of great benefits here and Thermo Fisher strives to help it's employees balance work and life.
good,"Flexible hours and good management staff"
good,"It was a great job to gain me experience for a real job. Usually I would work 40-50 hour weeks and people depended on me to make specific HPLC columns. My two bosses, as well as, the site manager were always very energetic and determined to finish our products for the week which made Thermo Fisher a fun and professional environment."
good,This temporary contract work was fulfilling and interesting. Sometimes guidance was hard to come by. I learned a lot about quality assurance engineering cycles.
good,Wenn nicht ständig die Standort Schließungen wären dann eigentlich ganz ok
good,"Samotná náplň práce je zajímavá, prostředí moderní, firemní kultura a atmosféra skvělá. Spousta benefitů vč. částečně volné pracovní doby. Na druhou stranu ale finanční ohodnocení není nijak zvlášť zajímavé a navíc už se i v Brně projevují některé negativní vlastnosti obřího korporátu, který je tak trochu jako malý stát (vše trvá dlouho, přibývá byrokracie...)."
good,"Hectic working environment, pay could be better and needs to increase for manufacturing techs. productive company, always busy in the manufacturing side"
good,"A strong organization with many talented people at the top of their fields, and resources and training provided to help people be at the top of their careers. Good opportunities provided to advance skills and give back to the community. "
good,"Great place to work if you are looking for a place that will provide a wide range of growth opportunities, decent benefits, and good tuition reimbursement programs."
good,"A very productive, fast paste and clean environment to work for.  Performed test procedures on Gas Analyzer Instruments, also excellent management leadership!"
good,"Marktleider op het gebied van farmacie. Wij leveren de klanten de produkten die nodig zijn bij forensisch onderzoek, medicijnontwikkeling, cellculture, DNA onderzoek e.d. "
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Corporate culture is good. Change is constant and there can be a lot of learning opportunities to take advantage of. The matrix organization can be confusing.
good,I enjoy working with the employees and training and mentoring them for the next level in their career. Some of the Supervisor team is all in to make the organization a number one operating company. Others need to search them selves to see if they are willing to put forth the effort.
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific was a great place to work. My direct manager was excellent, I enjoyed what I did and really liked all of my coworkers. I was disappointed to learn they are moving our project to Austria."
good,"Ask me about my dealings with Thermo Fisher.  There have been mixed reviews about employees experiences with the company.  If you want to know more, ask.  I'm not going to solve your survey questions"
good,"My typical day starts with checking emails since at least 90% of my work in analysis of B/S and P/L accounts."
good,I learn a lot about work culture and how high-end professional interact with an old working mentality and try to change the work structure in order to be competitive now.
good,"Working at Thermo Fisher is  enjoyable in general. The company is ambitious in its objectives. It values very much customer experience. There is a good balance between productivity and employee safety and well-being. However, not all aspects are positive. For instance, I do like the fact that research themes and projects are decided at business mangers' level. Thermo Fisher is now a big company, and as such it suffers from slow pace inherent to companies of this size. Lately, Thermo Fisher acquired several small companies. Integration is still in process, which generates redundancies."
good,"Headquarter is not communicating with sites and overwhole is not integrated even during harmonization appropriate messages were not delivered."
good,"Being a 1st job straight out of college, but this job help me a lot to develop confidence new learnings each day. Great colleagues to work with having a good amount of experience, Can be there for doubt solving if not able to understand the problems."
good,"Not very organized, needs better management system. People are nice there. However, the system needs to be updated. Working environment needs to be more environment friendly"
good,Innovative organization - served the Life Sciences industry for ultra-clean container/closure systems. Site personnel are excellent to work with - solid future.
good,"I have no feelings neither negative nor positive to say about the company, I worked there briefly under a sister company. The work steady and pay was ok while it lasted."
good,The Corporate office is a great work environment.  The employee benefits are generous.  Conveniently located.  Cares about their employees.  Very stable company.
good,ThermoFisher is a good place to work at. I interned at the Shanghai offices as an American student and was treated with respect equivalent to that of a fellow coworker. Everyone was kind and were always willing to help with work.
good,"Employees were allowed to accomplish their respective tasks without constant managing once trained. Ideas for improvements were encouraged, discussed and sometimes implemented."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,Thermo Fisher has many locations here in the Bay Area. The company actively encourages their employees to explore career advancement opportunities within. The company seeks to maintain employee satisfaction by moving towards work-life balance opportunities.
good,"Very huge company, can be stressful at first but after a while you get the hang of things. The freezer can be the worst part of the job if you are no prepared."
good,"It is a great place to get first insights into working in a GMP regulated environment. There are great learning opportunities, if you are willing to actively push for training all the time. Management weaknesses create a lot of uncertainties and unstructured working environment"
good,"Lots of smart people, relaxed work environment. Very flexible and good benefits. Office is casual and there is usually a happy hour once a week for people to get together and have a beer"
good,"My security depleted after each aquisition until last one. Unfortunately my position was shelved. Otherwise, i had a great 7 years prior with the last three aquisitions from ESA."
good,"Many ethics ,laid back ,fun people to have a conversation with. It's in Lenexa , no drama really but alil frustrating with the machines if they break down . Slows production down ."
good,"Thermo Fisher provided many opportunities for growth.  It is a good, solid company.  However, the merger and acquisition culture does create a fair amount of chaos."
good,"No hay discriminacion por parte de nadie, todos muy amables, cafe gratis, comer subsidiado, estacionamiento , areas climatizadas y mas que nada el excelente ambiente laboral que se siente en general en toda la planta"
good,A good and stable company for people who pursue their career in the file of chemical/biochemical scientific instrument. The company has interest to support the scientific development both in academia and industry.
good,"Working at Thermo Fisher in finance is tough, but it is well worth it. The pay is substantial. The only thing I can nitpick is the management. My boss has a tough time explaining things to me. Could be the broken-English."
good,"I was only an intern, but I learned a lot here and felt like I was part of the team. The management was good, my co-workers were good, and I was able to fiddle with cool gadgets."
good,Good place to work but limited advancement opportunities.  Unless you are on a specific track there is not much room for advancement. People are nice and they are very organized.
good,Overall it is a stable job with decent benefits and some room for career development. There are several issues regarding supporting teams and accountability.
good,"Working in an Organization like Thermo Fisher Scientific India can be quite taxing."
good,Management and Culture is not good but 100% Security of job and specially my team is good. When you work in Thermo like Company you very well understand in meaning of MNC & Indian based Company
good,"This is you typical modern fortune 500 company where ""Do more with less"" is the daily motto. There is never enough time to complete what needs to be done but everyone knows that and prioritization is expected."
good,"Work was always constant and busy. Lots of politics too so beware of that. Otherwise, the responsibilities and the pace of work was great to get the day started and passed by fast."
good,Every place has its good and has its bad.  Career development is weak and there is a lack of knowing what is going on with management decisions.  Great people work here though.
good,Overall it was a great place to work with a group of team members that were willing to work as a team and help as needed.  There are some areas that are cut-throat and competitive but overall they were limited as long as you did your job and was present for work.
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Good Company,"
good,Depending on your skills and desired outcome there is upward mobility and support at all levels of the company. They have high expectations but are not unreasonable and management is generally willing to support and work with you to achieve goals.
good,The workplace is filled with professional scientist and development teams. The atmosphere is collaborative and friendly without being cutthroat or competitive. One draw back is the lack of communication between different departments.
good,"A Thermo Fisher é um companhia que está adquirindo novas empresas a todo momento."
good,"It was an amazing place to work for. Sadly the original company Phadia got bought out by Thermo Fisher and the layoffs inevitably came. Was sad to leave, there was great management and job culture."
good,"its a great place to enhance your skills, but unfortunately they have to many projects to work on and there is a lake of proper info on project extinctions and other etc..."
good,"One aspect of Thermal Fisher Scientific that I loved is the flexible time and the understanding from management for my personal needs.  When I first came on board, I was a single mother with no family in the area.  So when I needed to handle personal situations, I could without feeling guilty of neglecting my job.  They were very understand of my motherly duties and family emergencies.  You do wear multiple hats which gives you the opportunity learn different areas of the company.  They also provide you with all the training and courses you need to grow."
good,"Fast paced job with high expectations and always trying to be 1 step ahead. Often high demands, with little or no recognition. Job is somewhat stable, but depends on division and annual growth"
good,They are a good company to work for. They look out for your best interests. I would recommend others to check with them and apply for current openings.
good,I enjoy the staff and the job. The company is very friendly to work for.  However it is and wil remain a temporary position.  I am looking for something permanent with benefits again.
good,The company is absolutely fantastic to work for. The job I did was absolutely horrible. Another job within the company would have been great but you cannot move to a new position until you have been in your current one for a year.
good,Small capacity Call Center. Very productive and laid back job environment. It is a total of 7 Customer service reps in the call center and everyone gets along and work is always done on time.
good,"Thermo Fisher has great job culture, but low pay and lack of advancement opportunities leave them lacking as an employer. Expectations were unrealistic - even entry-level hourly employees were pushed to complete extra projects on top of their regular job (with no overtime allowed)."
good,"Great company and decent pay, management doesn't seem to care much for employees, very high turnover rate. Not a whole lot of advancement opportunities."
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is a company transforming, and looking for talented people to join it's global team. It's a great place for innovative people to flourish. The company rewards those who meet goals and execute on projects. "
good,"Be ready to hit the ground running. High productivity is expected as part of what you do on a daily basis. Chasing metrics seems to have paramount importance and drives frequent shifts in priorities. You will very likely make some life-long friends but may not work with them long. Turnover is fairly high among those who have not already been with the company for many years. To me, these loses are among the hardest things about the job. I enjoy our efforts to engage with our local community and schools via charitable events and volunteer involvement."
good,"The work culture is very nice, it was a family environment and felt very good to stay for a short period. The company gives u lot of benefits for employees"
good,"Great place to get your foot in the door, a lot of childish drama and poor management. Pay is ok at best but can have opportunity at times. Great work schedules and willing to work with your personal situations."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"They have lots of opportunity within the company. Such as cross training in other departments.And the ability to move up in the company."
good,"Great overall office cutlture & ambiance, great learning opportunity in new department, inclused as a contingent worker, fast paced. "
good,Learned an awful lot about Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance however after a year my line manager left and there was little support or means of training to help with my learning.
good,"I liked my job at Thermo Fisher Scientific, however, there were continual turn-overs in management and I felt the management were unable to fully utilize their employees to their greatest potential. Suboptimal management ultimately made the work environment unstable for many employees."
good,"Great place to work, but can be stressful."
good,"Great people work there, highly technical people."
good,"I love working here, I am in charge of several of my projects and get to independently manage my time. Managers that I work for are great. It's a really fun place to work. The summer for interns was the best as they really try to give you exposure to the company opportunities and upper management/leaders in the company. I was extended for a year and am getting concerned that I may not get a full time position with them even after countless applications, so even though they seemed to promote internship leads to a position, I am beginning to have doubts."
good,"Fast paced environment and a lot of opportunity for interaction with many segments of the organization. Encouraged learning and movement within the organization. Great coworkers and customers. "
good,Was here as a temp for a few months. Worked with some decent people and the job was manageable and mostly enjoyable. However I noticed that the management were often negligent on matters relating to health and safety. Other than that it was a good experience and would definitely work there again.
good,"Busy, quick paced environment. With strong team oriented goals set and achieved daily. Management lacked proper warehouse knowledge and decision making skills, which made certain projects difficult and or impossible with excpectations. Work was challenging and fun!"
good,"my  time working at thermo fisher & scientific was a good experience , the one thing that i could complain about was work  the night, because of the unavailable spots on the other shift i wanted to work in.  working during the night shirt change my sleeping pattern which caused me to feel sleepy all the time."
good,"Distributeur de matériel de recherche aux Laboratoires"
good,"Good place to work overall. It is the team members that make it interesting. Management could use some guidance how to train, improve, and improve their team. Some people have sat in the same jobs for 5+ years. OT isn't forced on you but there are times when the work load is quite high for the team that they have."
good,"At first Thermo-Fisher appears to be an highly professional and top notch work place. With regularly renovated facilities and brand new tech, they've spared no expense. the company constantly has community and charity events to foster unity. safety is considered goal #1, they want you to stop and review every task you do before starting it, list all the hazards big and small and reduce any risk, every task, everyday, and every time, so while it may seem tedious everyone should intimately know the hazards of their work."
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is a decent employer.  I've basically worked for the same company for 24 years, albeit under multiple corporate entities as we kept getting bought out.  Thermo Fisher is the latest, and, a big step up from our last corporate master.  "
good,"Growing company with decent pay, good benefits and talented people. Lots of opportunities in a variety of fields including organic chemistry, biology, genomics, sales marketing and many others."

good,"I appreciate the team spirit in the company, it is enriching working in international teams and environments."
good,"I actually worked for them as a hire from a temp agency. When I was only offered a $.50 raise per hour to join the company I knew it was time to go."
good,"A typical day starts with running reports for my cells production meeting. run Production report to begin production scheduling. receive requests for expedited jobs from value streams and adjust production schedules accordingly. operate open equipment as needed to meet production requirements. Attend upper level meetings for my department and other value streams to discuss goal acheivenments and identify potential issues. work with teams to fix any issues that may arise. "
good,I LOVED my position at Thermo Fisher Scientific. I learned a lot through my colleagues about shipping hazardous material. Management in distribution held down the fort well. Every one I worked with there was great.
good,"Processed and paid multicurrency invoices from EMEA vendors for two entities in France. Liaised with suppliers and internal teams in French, Portuguese and Spanish on a daily basis to resolve queries."
good,"Thermo Fisher, previously Life Technologies seems like a great company.  The environment at my site is fun yet goal oriented. I can't provide a fully informed review due to the contract nature and my exposure to only two sites."
good,Management is excellent when looking for results; quiet place to work and plenty of opportunities if you stay with the company for many years.
good,Check data base for service calls and  installs. if not contact customers to see if they have any issues which needs attending to. Keep calender updated in seibel.
good,"GASTAR TEMPO PLANEJANDO: Antes de começar a fazer qualquer coisa no meu dia, eu faço um balanço de tudo o que precisa ser feito, até para ter a noção da quantidade de trabalho a ser feito versus o tempo que tenho disponível. Muitas pessoas se jogam no trabalho sem qualquer método, de maneira estabanada, fazendo atividades picadas, que geram retrabalho ou simplesmente não contribuem para o resultado. Por isso, fica a dica: planejar não é perda de tempo. É garantir que tudo será feito de maneira consciente e produtiva."
good,"- Meet customer / market requirements timely delivery of products "
good,A day was very busy all time. I learnt lots of things how to make custom oligonucleotides. Management is good and coworkers was also helping. Hardest part when sometimes we had to go early in the morning so that assignment could complete on time. When we employees everyday completed task on time and got good words from our supervisors and also when we met with co-workers of other shift on lunch after two weeks which is provided by the company.   
good,"As a sales person, working with Thermo is pleasure. Thermo helped me to transform as Manager from Executive. "
good,A company focused on making Life Even Better. I enjoyed working there. Great group of individuals working towards a common goal.
good,"Challenging job, good co-workers, but very stressful deadlines with often unclear instructions. The customer service that I provided on line and via phone was the favorite part of my job, excel spreadsheets not so much. I would still be working there right now, but they eliminated my job from the budget."
good,There has been no such thing as a typical day at work over the last 8 years. Every day is different with new challenges and interesting problems to overcome.
good,"The day started off with daily cycle count ( a random amount of parts to be counted to maintain inventory control) Then updated metrics charts through the mapics system they used. Directing the material handlers in what they needed to get done through out the day as well as redirecting them to meet our goals as a company. working at ThermoFisher i learned a vast amount of safety training as well as eithcs and leadership training. management was all over between supervisors, middle management,upper management, and corporate management. there was no communication or direction from one to the other. The hardest part of my job is that you were just a number and easily replaced no matter how good your work is just to save a few dollars. the best part was the experience i learned there."
good,"Very good place to work, and great working enviroment. Great managment and co workers."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."

good,"Good company to work for if a family person, give more then enough paid time off, great health benefits and good work environment. You work primarily with your hands and small items."
good,Solid direct management.  Senior management does change as leaders are moved to different departments and divisions to expand their skills and leadership capabilities.
good,"Thermo Fisher was in the process of outsourcing their accounts payable and receivables department in Puerto Rico. So, I was there for a short time to assist with their transitioning process."
good,Work is easy to do and plenty of it so you will barely ever have to look for something to do. They do alot to build a relationship with their employees
good,"The high volume of calls allowed one the opportunity to interact with many   different types of customers in such a different fields."

good,"Good place to start an IT career. supportive and friendly workers, I started my first IT job here, the staffs are very supportive and friendly, its a good place for a start."
good,Great company as a whole.     They do not promote within as much I would like for them to.   Would like to see a mentoring program.   Good employees with a good culture.
good,It paid well but management change affected the culture. Many reps left due to this. It was an overall good experience but I probably wouldn't work there again
good,Fast paced customer service in call center. Low morale among co-workers. Extremely hard to schedule time off due to scheduling system in place. The pay was in line with the work and offered good benefits.
good,Company focused on product development and product placement in the marketplace. Competitive in their field; the people were great. Lot of support from co-workers and opportunities to work with other TF divisions.

good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"This job is pretty competitive. Over the past 18 years, I’ve learned many things from this job such as how to become a machine operator, and teamwork. The workspace isn’t too dirty, and the people are decent."
good,The things I liked the most were the opportunities to collaborate with other departments and learn about the business in a larger scope than just my job function.  I disliked that sometimes the bureaucratic tendencies of such a large corporation would get in the way of practicality or progress.
good,Fast moving company turnovers in short time. Could have had a little more advanced training on newer/replaced equipment. Focus was the most challenging as personal and work were in flux.
good,Good culture and colleagues.  A lot of trainings and learning opportunities.  The management is very good and focus on customer needs.  I've been happy working at ThermoFisher.
good,"I liked everything about Thermo Fisher Scientific , I just didn't like the commute.  Co worker were friendly and very knowledgeable. Supervisors not forthcoiming"
good,The work experience at Thermo Fisher Scientific was great.  I was in a temporary position but they made us feel like we were staffed through the actual company even though we didn't get the benefits and everything that the permanent employees received.  The work environment was great and there was no pressure to make quotas and the assistance received when you needed help was great as well.
good,The office I worked in is closed and I don't have any experience with any of the other offices. My limited experience with the other offices was fine.
good,"Much of the work is focused on driving sustainability in processes.  The company performs well and people are dedicated to their jobs and interactions with others.  Work is focused on meeting customer requirements and generating quality products and testing.  There are lots of opportunities to self-direct to make improvements, but there is a lot of ongoing work with tight deadlines that have to be maintained.  Processes and procedures are defined very broadly so specific workflow is sometimes unclear.  The company is focused on improving in this area. Overall, a good place to work that has a strong position in the industry."
good,"Really was a learning experience working in the cooperate world, because I was sited at Halliburton main campus.  Loved my management. Would recommend working there to anyone."

good,Typical day was designing electronic circuits. I learned a lot about the food industry and contamination detection in food products. Management was generally good and sustained. The culture was excellent. Hardest part was travelling to and from work. The most enjoyable part was the design work.
good,"I got my start here - and it was a decent place to work.  Started in a helpdesk role, but gradually got into desktop support and then server/network admin work.  Was paid fairly for an IT Co/Op Contractor still in school. "
good,"Challenging, fast-paced environment that afforded opportunity to work collaboratively, or independently on various marketing-related projects to support the first responder market (i.e. civilian and military firefighters, hazmat techs, and rescue technicians)."
good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"The best part on Thermo Fisher Scientific is the ""Diversity""."
good,"It's got great leadership but it's competitive and cut throat in nature.  It promotes a high performer environment, so in order to succeed as an individual, you need to be a high performer."
good,Relaxed atmosphere and a good balance of involvement between management and employees.  Well diverse atmosphere and opportunities to development within the company.  The pay scale needs considerable evaluation.
good,I would recommend securing a position with Thermo Fisher. They ae a global leader in Scientific supplies and equipment. Excellent opportunity for someone willing to do extensive travel for the position.

good,"We are given the opportunity to have a chance to learn new skills on a daily basis, along with cross training. The management is supportive and involved in production process.  At times the workplace culture can be challenging, and not always supportive of personal believes. It is rewarding to be a part of a team that makes  a  product that improves peoples lives."
good,"Good working environment and culture, colleague are helpful and willing to share their experiences. Many on going projects, good place to learn and work to gain experience in this R&D health care sector."

good,"The people are nice and the work is engaging and dynamic. I like working for a company that is doing good for the world, and wants to continue doing doing so."
good,"Overall,I really enjoyed my work experience with Thermofisher, but after the birth of my first child, my heart was just no longer with it. I disagreed with a lot of the changes that were being made and the it got to the point that the company and I were no longer compatible. Sucks for me, but it happens. Our paths twist and turn throughout life. While i didnt agree with some of the process changes that took place, I must give praise to the amazing Customer Service Management team, as well as the entire Customer Support team. There are always bad apples in the bunch, but for the most part, everyone was friendly, driven, and a lot of fun to be around."

good,"Great culture of continuous improvement."
good,Thermo Scientific™ molecular biology products include innovative high-quality reagents and plastic consumables designed to deliver reproducibility and performance for every step of your molecular biology workflow.
good,"A good team can accomplish anything.  When Management acted as part of a team made up of Associates; Technicians; Engineers; QC, problems got solved in record time. All the stumbling blocks that get in the way of achieving goals (e.g., on time deliveries) were examined and distributed to the team members to resolve.  Any problems that could not be resolved within a day would be escalated to a higher level team made up of managers.  If the problems were big enough they would make it all the way to the top tier.  The issues would get solved within a few days rather than getting shelved.  All the activity would happen in a series of stand up meetings through out the work day, everyday.  Solutions weren't easy, but solutions were found.  Goals achieved and exceeded."
good,"Left because Life Technologies was acquired.  We were unsure about thermos intentions, and I was recruited out.  Great place to begin with, but lots of politics and culture changed as team pushed to sell business"
good,Warm family feel to the work environment. Management works with you and does all they can to work with your schedule to allow family and home time. They cross train upon request and are very understanding.

good,"I worked here as a temp for just about a year. The location that I worked at is actually a plant location but their Anatomical Pathology division is based here. The people were all very nice, and easy to get along with. Compensation wise it's hard for me to really know since I was a temp but I got the impression the salaries were average. There is a lot of chance at advancement IF you are willing to relocate - Thermo is a very large company with many different locations."
good,This is an excellent company with exceptional values & great management which motivates / ensures that you are reaching your potential with the chance at excelling further.
good,"The benefits are no longer good anymore, but the people and the culture are great!"

good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific can be an excellent place for you to have a career, the jobs are mostly interesting and staff are generally friendly at the different locations visited during my tenure there. The benefits packages are above average with generous holiday allowance and flexible working hours. Progression can be difficult, towards the end of my time there i encountered a less friendly line manager. He was the 5th manager in 7 years at the company and did not act kindly towards me. The official process to object with HR failed to assist me despite blatant wrongdoing and effectively made me resign so my once great career prospect was ended. I could have still been there to this day otherwise"

good,"I'm a site specialist in the downtown Seattle area. I work a great deal in inventory within the warehouse and I stock lab floors with various materials. I have an amazing team, the most understanding supervisor one could ask for and the work environment is really laid back. Just as long as your tasks are being completed, no one should have a problem working this gig."

good,"Excellent place to call home, room for advancement.  Supportive management and director level leadership.  Innovative and collaborative culture.  Job security and recognition."
good,"Thermo Fisher Scientific is a company that is great to work for if you  thrive in environments with a high degree of autonomy and a culture that supports ambitious independent people. Basically you'll get out of it what you put in. Like many large companies (70,000+ employees) the pace and process for executing on a strategy can be frustrating, however the company operates in a very agile and decentralized manner for the most part. Leadership still has a bit of a small company mentality which is a good thing, in that I always felt very comfortable speaking with the most senior people in the company. Many of these leaders are genuinely supportive of providing career advancement for talented hard working people as well, which is quite refreshing."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Engineers are expected to be self starters, self supporting.  Though there is collaboration."
good,Great company and would love to rejoin on the future.  Employee focused and easy to work for.  Very ethical company that promotes being the leader in life science to help customers win and achieve their goals

good,Good competattive wages and working enviorment aslo the benefits are good. Despite the lay off its a good company. They provide excellent service to our emplyees and cunstomers.
good,"I handled bio waste levels one and two. I autoclaved materials and waste in large autoclave machines, then properly labeled boxes to contain the waste, etc. It had to be done properly and securely. I enjoyed working almost independently. The hardest part of the job was to inspire the DuPont researchers to properly prepare their waste bags for pick-up."
good,"Just be aware of union rules in your state. Most states are too lax for the chemicals and stress this employer could potentially entail. Otherwise, it handles all the basics well enough."
good,Thermofisher is a good place to work and I would recommend this company to anyone due to its great benefits. Overtime was great but HR was unfair to some of its employees.

Day to day was more or less the same routine but with the extra time I had I would help different departments. The staff were quite reasonable, well organized, professional, cordial and other positive descriptions. I only have positive things to say about this company."
good,Life Tech was a nice place to work for 10 plus years. I had great co-workers and really enjoyed my work in quality control. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with constantly shifting priorities in a very fast paced environment.

I had really terrific managers during my time at Life Tech. They were supportive and helpful and easy to talk to.
good,Thermo Fisher has opportunities for growth for the employee who applies principles of training and techniques. The laboratory environment which  is where I worked is an exciting place to learn and grow. While working a Thermo Fisher I was a trainer and with that function I was able to teach and learn from employees from various educational and cultural backgrounds. The basic rule to live by at Thermo Fisher is to be accountable by assuring the work done is accurate and truthful.

good,"Ainda falta criar uma cultura forte e respeitada"
good,"HR1.  If you like slow paced progression and an endless boring set of three things to do for 2 months before they train you on phones or anything for that matter, then this is the place for you.  Advancement isn't really there, you are automatically a Temp - to - Hire and they can let you go without reason for any reason, but Im sure they would lie about it anyway, such was the case in my contract dismissal. I was lied too, belittled and not trusted.  I was barely even talked to when anything came up (which wasn't very often at all, but in the case that it was, it went silent). I don't recommend HR1 to anyone else, applying to Thermo Fisher, but I would recommend the company as a whole as it is the world leader in delivering science and the benefits are truly amazing. I hope anyone who is reading this understands that I was mistreated and treated differently, maybe it was because I had a family member higher up in the company than them, maybe it was because I was progressing to fast for them, or maybe they just wanted someone else to take my spot because I was taking things by the horns, and they don't like that too much. Either way, It was a decent experience and I can't wait to work there again, perhaps in an area where my knowledge and talent can truly shine. Thanks HR1. I appreciate the opportunity that you never really gave me.  You truly did not need the help if you were able to just cut me without notice or without any kind of guidance.  See ya around."
good,"People don't quit jobs the quit their boss. There was new part time employees on a weekly basis, 80% of them left because of a boss that chose to bark vs show what he wanted"
good,No other company has the diversity of products.  The Sales force is excellent. Unity Lab service personnel are some of the best engineers in the business bar none.  But for the scientist track.. There is little in the way of career advancement.  Upper management tends to not listen to the voice of customer as heard by the lower level employees who hear and deal directly with customer and customer problems.
good,"bonne entreprise"
good,They ask way to much of one person. This type of work requires at least four people to do a job that they only have one person doing. I would say that this company needs further attention period. It's very difficult work and they expect you to do it fast. Spills are done the whole time but the meds are still able to just go through.
good,"I was contracted to TF for one year, But the day before Thanksgiving they terminated myself and 30 other contracts and we were shown the door. So my contract was until May of 2020.

good,"A typical day for me consists almost entirely of web content management, short (a few hour to a day) projects, mostly concerning the day-to-day maintenance of the web catalog. It is a highly structured environment. I have learned a great deal about web design and web catalog structure, but have found it difficult to branch out into other areas, such as content writing.

good,"Detection of pathogens and drug resistance mutations in multiplexed formats is of great value in clinical research. Currently, several technologies are available for disease gene mutation and nucleic acid based pathogen detection. However, few of them are suitable for detection of large numbers of pathogen targets with high sensitivity, detection accuracy and fairly fast workflow. Assays with such criteria are desired for use in pathogen detection and screening. To address this need, we evaluated the Ion Torrent technology for this application. The Ion Torrent technology is a new sequencing platform developed by Life Technologies that can be used for high throughput sequencing. It uses semiconductor chips with high-density array of wells and a parallel array of semiconductor sensors to perform direct real-time measurement of the hydrogen ions produced during DNA sequencing reaction on the chip. This technology enables the direct translation of genetic information (DNA) to digital information (DNA sequence), rapidly generating large quantities of high quality data. In our study, 41 pathogens were amplified, pooled and sequenced on Personal Genome MachineTM (PGMTM). These pathogen targets include some of the most contagious infectious agents such as the herpes virus, human hepititis virus, SARS coronavirus, influenza, human adenovirus, bacillus anthracis, and CMV mutants. We demonstrated the ability of the Ion Torrent to detect all 41 pathogens in the samples accurately, as well as drug resistant mutations in CMV, thus the PGMTM system could become a valuable tool for different"

good,"Everyday was generally the same routine. There was usually three main things that I do everyday; I make sure everyone knows what they're doing with the daily schedule, set up the line with workers, then check the materials to make each product. When there was a new product to be made I am the person who would learn to make the new product then train other workers to do the same. If there was something wrong with the final product, then I would need to work with engineers to make changes to the product so it would work correctly. I am also involved with the lean manufacturing, processing, and maintenance of equipment. There are many things I learned at work. I would pick up different skills when building each new product from start to finish. Management was good. I worked close with my managers in the core team and the management has improved from what it was like before. My co-workers worked well together and we were very productive. When things needed to get done, we would work until everything on the schedule was complete, even if it meant staying late after work and working on weekends.The hardest part of my job was when products needed to be made and there weren't enough parts to finish our work. If this happened, we would only make as many products we could finish and the rest of the products would be on hold until we could get enough parts to finish them. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work with good people. They were friendly, understanding, and they were still able to stay productive."

good,"The best part of the job was that you were always doing something different. Learning new things is a big thing for me and a lot of the times you would be running a different product so there would have to be a different set up at time with the machine which i truly liked a lot. The co-workers there where always willing to help and teach you new things, The hardest part of the job for me would probably have been waking up at 4 am in the winter but after awhile i got used to it because i've never had a job where i've had to wake up so early but it was worth it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that they where so understanding, because i was going through a lot of things at the time and relocating and the fact that they understood everything about my personal life made my job enjoyable."
good,"During a typical day at work, I constantly interact with my direct reports and with other members of management to resolve a variety of issues. Many times I have said that I have learned more at Thermo Fisher than I did in college and I still feel that way.

The most enjoyable part of the job for me is that I learn something new every day!"

Good Cross Training would make this company that I this is a very good employer much better. Better Training from people that want to train and be successful is the key.

We had a lot of autonomy which I like and we basically drove our own development. If you wanted to learn more or make improvements, you had to take initiative. Most of the time, leadership would help you try to achieve that or point you to other development opportunities. I enjoyed the work environment and the culture.

good,"The team at Thermo Fisher tries very hard to make it a professional environment where achievers get recognized and advance.  People who just show up for work are paid well and taken care of but don't get leadership opportunities.  The company hires from within, at least for manufacturing positions, and there is opportunity to advance if you are patient and smart.  Seniority does not matter as much as hard work and your ability to learn and use your knowledge."

good,"Lots of smart people, but recent acquisition has been a challenge.  Going from a company that operates with the goal to be acquired to a company that needs to be strategic has been a struggle.  I think better days are ahead once things settle."
good,Every member of the team operates as one unit. Able to work together towards a positive outcome. Management has been of great help during on job trainings.
good,"Like any big company, Thermo has its issues.  Processes are constantly in a state of flux while management tries new things. Low-level managers are great, but are required to rely on metrics too much. The pay and benefits are very good, though."

The benefits with Thermo Fisher are top notch, medical, dental vision 401k (6% match), 100% tuition reimbursement.  The culture  is intense and work is hard, but if you are a good worker, you are rewarded.  Management is involved in tier meetings each day to keep us involved with the daily business.  The leaders are committed to the people and you see this through the improvments and investments that are consistently made at the site.  There are a few employees that complain a lot and I encourage them to research other workplaces.  No where are you involved as a production employee (or in my case as a temp) in solving problems or encouraged to progress your career by your manager- I am working hard for this team and  I hope that I can join the team long term"

Procedures for any specific manufacturing job include pictures and diagrams to help workers who have difficulty understanding English. Overall, I was happy with my time working at Thermo Fisher. The main problem I found was that the hiring process was long, and temporary employees are limited to only a few months before they are let go, pretty much removing the chance for advancement into a full time permanent position."

This was my first industry position, and I have learned a great deal about business in my time at Thermo Fisher, and I think it has made me a much stronger scientist overall."
good,"I was just a hired contractor, but I felt like a full-time employee. I was given good responsibility and invited to participate in company and team outings. There is a great work/life balance, no one wants to you to work late if you don't have to. Enjoyed working and learned a lot."

Overtime is both mandatory and volunteer.  There is room for advancement.  Overall, this is a good company to work for.  The only drawback is that you are ""forced"" to use your PTO (paid time off) any time you need off and if you use it all you are still required to go negative instead of not getting paid."
